<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Buffalo Woman Maghan Kon Fatta, the father of Sundiata, was renowned for his beauty in every land; but he was also a good king loved by all the people. In his capital of Nianiba 7 he loved to sit often at the foot of the great silk-cotton tree¥ which dominated his palace of Canco. Maghan Kon Fatta had been reigning a long time and his. eldest son Dankaran Touman was already eight years old and often came to sit on the ox-hide beside his father. Well now, one day when the king had taken up his usual position under the silk-cotton tree surrounded by his kinsmen he saw a man dressed like a hunter coming towards him; he wore the tight-fitting trousers of the favourites of Kondolon Ni Sane, and his blouse oversewn with cowries showed that he was a master of the hunting art. All present turned towards the un.known man whose bow, polished with frequent usage, shone in the sun. The man walked up in front of the king, whom he recog.nized in the midst of his courtiers. He bowed and said, 'I salute you, king of Mali, greetings all you of Mali. I am a hunter chasing game and come from Sangaran; a fearless doe h_as guided me to the walls of Nianiba. By the grace¥ of my master the great Simbon 10 my arrows have hit her and now she lies not far from your walls. As is fitting, oh king, I have come to bring you your portion'. He took a leg from his leather sack whereupon the king's griot, Gnankouman Doua, seized upon the leg and said, 'Stran.ger, whoever you may be you will be the king's guest because you respect custom; come and take your place on the mat beside us. The king is pleased because he loves righteous men.' The king nodded his approval and all the courtiers agreed. The griot continued in a more familiar tone, 'Oh you who come from the Sangaran, land of the favourites of Kondolon Ni Sane, you who have doubtless had an expert master, will you open your pouch of knowledge for us and. instruct us with your convprsation, for you have no doubt visited several lands.' /. The king, still silent, gave a nod of approval and a courtier added, 'The hunters of Sangaran are the best soothsayers; if the stranger wishes we could learn a lot from him.' The hunter came and sat down near Gnankouman Doua who vacated one end of the mat to him. Then he said, 'Griot of the king, I alllnot one of these hunters whose tongues are more dex.terous than their arms; I am no spinner of adventure yarns, nor do I like playing upon the credulity of worthy folk; but, thanks to the lore which my master has imparted to me, I can boast of being a seer among seers.' He took out of his hunter's bag 11 twelve cowries which he threw on the mat. The king and all his entourage now turned towards the stranger who was jumbling up the twelve shiny shells with his bare hand. Gnankouman Doua discreetly brought to the king's notice that the soothsayer was left-handed. The left i hand is. the hand of evil, but in the divining art it is said thati left-handed people are the best. The hunter muttered some in-\ comprehensible words in a low voice while he shuffled and; jumbled the twelve cowries into different positions which he mused on at length. All of a sudden he looked up at the king and said 'Oh king; the world is full of mystery, all is hidden-and we kno~ nothing but what we can see. The silk-cotton tree springs from a tiny seed-that which defies the tempest weighs in its germ no more than a grain of ric~. Kingd~ms are like trees; some will be silk-cotton trees, others will remam dwarf palms and the powerful silk-cotton tree will cover them with its shade. Oh, who can recognize in the little child the great king to come? The great comes from the small; truth and falsehood have both suckled at the same breast. Nothing is certain, but, sire, I can see two strangers over there coming towards your city.' He fell silent and looked in the direction of the city gates for a short while. All present silently turned towards the gates. The soothsayer returned to his cowries. He shook them in his palm with a skilled hand and then threw them out. 'King of Mali, destiny marches with great strides, Mali is _abo~t to emerge from the night. Nianiba is lighting up, but what IS this light that comes from the east?' 'Hunter,'á said Gnankouman Doua, 'your wordsá are obscure. Make your speech comprehensible to us, speak in the clear language of your savanna.' 12 . ~1 am coming to that now, griot. Listen to my message. Listen, sire. Y~u have ruled over the kingdom which your ancestors bequeathed to you and you have no other ambition but to pass .on this realm, intact if not increased, to your descendants; but, fine king~ your successor is not yet born. I see two hunters 1 co1:11Lngto your city; they have come from afar and a woman accompanies them. Oh, that woman! She is ugly, she is hideous, she bears on her back a disfiguring hump. Her monstrous eyes seem to have been merely laid on her face, but, mystery of mysteries, this is the woman you must marry, sire, for she wil1 be the mother of him who will make the name of Mali immortal for ever. The child will be the seventh star, the seventh con.queror of the earth. He will be more mighty than Alexander. But, oh king, for destiny to lead this woman to you a sacrifice is necessary; you must offer up a red bull, for the bull is powerful. When its blood soaks into the ground nothing more will hinder the arrival of your wife. There, I have said what I had to say, but everything is in the hands of the Almighty.' The hunter picked up his cowries and put them away in his bag. 'I am only passing through, king of Mali, and now I return to Sangaran. Farewell.' The hunter disappeared but neither the king, Nare Maghan, nor his griot, Gnankouman Doua, forgot his prophetic words; soothsayers see far ahead, their words are not always for the immediate present; man is in a hurry but time is tardy and everything has its season. Now one day the king and his suite were again seated under the great silk-cotton tree of Nianiba, chatting as was their wont. Suddenly their gaze was drawn by some strangers who came into the city. The small entourage of the king watched in silent surprise. Two young hunters, handsome and of fine carriage, were walking along preceded by a young maid. They turned towards the Court. The two men were carrying shining bows of silver on their shoulders. The one who seemed the elder of the two walked with the assurance of a master hunter. When the strangers were a few steps from the king. they bowed and the elder spoke thus: 'We greet King Nare Maghan Kon Fatta and his 5'1tourage. We come from the land of Do,13 but my brother and 1belong to Mali and we are of the tribe of Traore. Hunting and adventure led us as far as the distant land of Do where King Mansa Gnemo Diarra reigns. I am called Oulamba and my brother .Oulani. The young girl is from Do and we bring her as a present to the king, for my brother and I deemed her worthy to be a king's wife.' The king and his suite tried in vain to get a look at the young git!, for she stayed kneeling, her head lowered, and had deliber.ately let her kerchief hang in front of her face. If the young girl succeeded in hiding her face, she did not, however, manage to cover up the hump which deformed her shoulders and back. She was ugly in a sturdy sort of way. You could see her muscular arms, and her bulging breasts pushing stoutly against the strong pagne of cotton fabric which was knotted just under her armpit. -1 The king considered her for a moment, then the handsome Maghan turned his head away. He stared a long time at Gnan.kouman Doua .then he lowered his head. The griot understood all the sovereign's embarrassment. 'You are the guests of the king; hunters, we wish you peace in Nianiba, for all the sons of Mali are but one. Come and sit down, slake your thirst and relate to the king by what adventure you left Do with this maiden.' The king nodded his approval. The two brothers looked at each other and, at a sign from the elder, the younger went up to the king and put down on the ground the calabash of cold water which a servant had brought him. The hunter said: 'After the great harvest 14 my brother and I left our village to hunt. It was in this way that our pursuit of game led us as far as the approaches of the land of Do. We met two hunters, one of whom was wounded, and we learnt from them that an amazing buffalo was ravaging the countryside of Do. Every day it claimed some victims and nobody dared leave ,1,. the village after sunset. The king, Do Mansa-Gnemo Diarra, had promised the finest rewards to the hunter who killed the buffalo. We decided to try our luck too and so we penetrated into the land of Do. We were advancing warily, our eyes well skinned, when we saw an old woman by the side of a river. She was weeping and lamenting, gnawed by hunger. Until then no passer-by had deigned to stop by her. She beseeched us, in the name of the Almighty, to give her something to eat. Touched by her tears I approached and took some pieces of dried meat from my hunter's bag. When she had eaten well she said, "Hunter, may God requite you with the charity you have given me." We were making ready to leave when she stopped me. "I know," she said, "that you are going to try your luck against the Buffalo of Do, but you should know that many others before you have met their. death through their foolhardiness, for arrows are useless against the buffalo; but, young hunter, your heart is generous and it is you who will be the buffalo's vanquisher. I am the buffalo you are looking for, and your generosity has vanquished me. I am the buffalo that ravages Do. I have killed a hundred and seven hunters and wounded seventy-seven; every day I kill an inhabi.tant of Do and the king, Gnemo Diarra, is at his wit's end which jinn to sacrifice to. Here, young man, take this distaff and this egg and go to the plain of Ourantamba where I browse among the king's crops. Before using your bow you must take aim at me three times with this distaff; then draw your bow and I shall be vulnerable to your arrow. I shall fall but shall get up and pursue you into a dry plain. Then throw the. egg behind you and a great mire will come into being where I shall be unable to advance and then you will kill me. As a proof of your victory you must cut off the buffalo's tail, which is of gold, and take it to the king, from whom you will exact your due reward. As for me, I have run my course and punished the king of Do, my brother, for depriving me of my part of the inheritance." Crazy with joy, I seized the distaff and the egg, but the old woman stopped me with a gesture and said, "There is one condition, hunter." "What condition?" I replied impatiently. "The king promises the hand of the most beautiful maiden of Do to the victor. When all the people of Do are gathered and you are told to choose her whom you want as a wife you must search in the crowd and you will find a very ugly maid-uglier than you can imagine-sitting apart on an observation platform; it is her you must choose. She is called Sogolon Kedjou, or Sogolon Kondouto, because she is a hunchback. You will choose her for she is my wraith. 16 She will be an extraordinary woman if you manage to possess her. Prom.ise me you will choose her, hunter." I swore to, solemnly, between the hands of the old woman, and we conthµred on our way. The plain of Ourantamba was half a day's journey from there. On the way we saw hunters who were fleeing and who watched us quite dumbfounded. The buffalo was at the other end of the plain but when it saw us it charged with menacing horns. I did as the old woman had told me and killed the buffalo. I cut off its tail and we went back to the town of Do as night was falling, but we did not go before the king until morning came, 16 The king had the drums beaten and before midday all the in.habitants of the country were gathered in the main square. The mutilated carcass of the buffalo had been placed in the middle of the square and the delirious crowd abused it, while our names were sung in a thousand refrains. When the king appeared a deep silence settled on the crowd. "I promised the hand of the most beautiful maiden in Do to the brave hunter who saved us from the scourge which overwhelmed us. The buffalo of Do is dead and here is the hunter who has killed it. I am a man of my word. Hunter, here are all the daughters of Do; take your pick." And the crowd showed its approval by a great cheer. On that day all the daughters of Do wore their festive dress; gold shone in their hair and fragile wrists bent under the weight of heavy silver bracelets. Never did so much beauty come together in one place. Full of pride, my quiver on my back, I swaggered before the beautiful girls of Do who were smiling at me, with their teeth as white as the rice of Mali. But I remembered the words of the old woman. I went round the great circle many times until at -last I saw Sogolon Kedjou sitting apart on a raised platform. I elbowed my way through the crowd, took Sogolon by the hand and drew her intQ the middle of the circle. Showing her to the king, I said, "Oh King Gnemo Diarra, here is the one I have chosen from among the young maids of Do; it is her I would like for a wife." The choice was so paradoxical that the king could not help laughing, and then general laughter broke out and the people split their sides with mirth. They took me for a fool, and I became a ludicrous hero. "You've got to belong to the tribe of ¥ Traore to do things like that," said somebody in the crowd, and it was thus that my brother and I left Do the very same day pur.sued by the mockery of the Kondes. '17 The hunter ended his story and the noble king Nare Maghan determined to solemnize his marriage with all the customary formalities so that no body could dispute the rights of the son to be born to him. The two hunters were considered as being rela.tives of Sogolon and it was to them that Gnankouman Doua bore the traditional cola nuts. 18 By agreement with the hunters the marriage was fixed for the first Wednesday of the new moon. The twelve villages of old Mali and all the peoples allied to them were acquainted with this and on the appointed day delegations flocked from all sides to Nianiba, the town of Maghan Kon Fatta. -, Sogolon had been lodged with an old aunt of the king's. Since her arrival in Nianiba she had never once gone out and everyone i longed to see the woman for whom Nare Maghan was preparing such a magnificent wedding. It was known that she was not beautiful, but the curiosity of everyone was aroused, and already a thousand anecdotes were circulating, most of them put about by Sassouma Berete, the king's first wife. The royal drums of Nianiba announced the festivity at crack of dawn. The town awoke to the sound of tam-tams which answered each other from one district to another; from the midst of the crowds arose the voices of griots singing the praises of Nare Maghan. At the home of the king's old aunt, the hairdresser of Nianiba was plaiting Sogolon Kedjou's hair. As she lay on her mat, her head resting on the hairdresser's legs, she wept softly, while the king's sisters came to chaff her, as was the custom. 'This is your last day of freedom; from now onwards you will be our woman.' 'Say farewell to your youth,' added another. 'You won't dance in the square any more and have yourself admired by the boys,' added a third. áá~ Sogolou never uttered a word and from tirne to tirne the old hairdresser said, 'There, there, stop crying. It's a new life begin. , ning, you know, more beautifulthag_y&lt;&gt;11_ think. You will be a mother and you will know -the joy of being a queen surrounded by your children. Come now, daughter, don't listen to the gibes of your sisters-in-law.' In front of the house the poetesses who belonged to the king's sisters chanted the name of the young bride. During this time the festivity was reaching its height in front of the king's enclosure. Each village was represented by a troupe of dancers and musicians; in the middle of the courtyard the elders were sacrificing oxen which the servants carved,,-Uj?,-áwhile ungainly vultures, perched on the great silk-cotton tree, watched the hecatomb with their eyes. Sitting in front of the palace, Nare Maghan listened to the grave music of the 'bolon' 19 in the midst of his courtiers. Doua, stand. ing amid the eminent guests, held his great spear in his hand and sang the anthem of the Mandingo kings. Everywhere in the village people were dancing and singing and members of the royal family envinced their joy, as was fitting, by distributing grain, clothes, and even gold. Even the jealo~s Sassouma Berete took part in this largesse and, among other thmgs, bestowed fme Join-cloths on the poetesses. But night was falling and the sun h.ad hidden behind the mountain. It was time for the marriage procession to form up in front of the house of the king's aunt. The tam-tams had fallen silent. The old female relatives of the king had washed and per.fumed Sogolon and now she was dressed completely in white with a large veil over her head. Sogolon walked in front held by two old women. The king's relatives followed and, behind, the choir of young girls of Mali sang the bride's departure song, keeping time to the songs by clapping their hands. The villagers and guests were lined up along the stretch of ground which separated the aunt's house from the palace in order to see the procession go by. When Sogolon had reached the threshold of the king's antechamber one of his young brothers lifted her vigorously from the ground and ran off with her towards the palace while the crowd cheered. The women danced in front of the palace of the king for a long while, then, after receiving money and presents from members of the royal family, the crowd dispersed and night darkened overhead. 'She wil1 be an extraordinary woman if you manage to possess her.' Those were the words of the old woman of Do, but the conqueror of the buffalo had not been able to co11quer the young girl. It was only as an afterthought that the two hunters, Oulani and Oulamba, had the idea of giving her to the king of Mali. That evening, then, Nare Maghan tried to perform his duty as a husband but Sogolon repulsed his advances. He persisted, but his efforts were in vain and early the next morning Doua found the king exhausted, like a man who had suffered a great defeat. 'What is the matter, my king?' asked the griot. 'I have been unable to possess her-and besides, she frightens me, this young girl. I even doubt whether she is a human being; when I drew close to her during the night her body became covered with long hairs and that scared me very much. All night long I called upon my wraith but he was unable to master Sogolon's.' All that day the king did not emerge and Doua was the only one to enter and leave the palace. All Nianiba seemed puzzled. The 10 used to her ugliness. But the first wife of the king, Sassouma old women who had come early to seek the virginity pagne¥¥ 1 had been discreetly turned away. And this went on for a week. Nare Maghan had vainly sought advice from some great sor. cerers but all their tricks were powerless in overcoming the wraith of Sogolon. But one night, when everyone was asleep, Nare Maghan got up. He unhooked his hunter's bag from the wall and, sitting in the middle of the house, he spread on the ground the sand which the bag contained. The king began tracing ';mysterious signs in the sand; he traced, effaced and began again. . Sogolon woke up. She knew that sand talks, 21 but she was in.trigued to see the king so absorbed at dead of night. Nare Maghan stopped drawing signs and with his hand under his chin he seemed to be brooding on the signs. All of a sudden he jumped up, bounded after his sword which hung above his bed, and said, 'Sogolon, Sogolon, wake up. A dream has awakened Irie out of my sleep and the protective spirit of the Mandingo kings has appeared to me. I was mistaken in the interpretation I put upon the words of the hunter who led you to me. The jinn has revealed to me their real meaning. Sogolon, I must sacrifice you to the greatness of my house. The blood of a virgin of the tribe of Konde n1ust be spilt, and you are the Konde virgin whom fate has brought under my roof. Forgive me, but I must accomplish my mission. Forgive the hand which is going to shed your blood.' 'No, no--why me?-no, I don't want to die.' 'It is useless,'. said the king. 'It is not me who has decided.' He seized Sogolon by the hair with an iron grip, but so great had been her fright that she had already fainted. In this faint, she was congealed in her human body and her wraith was no longer in her,á and when she woke up, she was already a wife. That very night, Sogolon conceived. 22 The Lion Child A wife quickly grows accustomed to her state. Sogolon now walked freely in the king's great enclosure and people also got Berete, turned out to be unbearable. She was restless, and smarted to see the ugly Sogolon proudly flaunting her pregnancy about the palace. What would become of her, Sassou:ma Berete, if her son, already eight years old, was disinherited in favour of the child that Sogolon was going to bring into the world? All the king's attentions vYent to the mother-to-be. On returning from the wars he would bring her the best portion of the booty-fine Join-cloths and rare jewels. Soon, dark schemes took form in the 7 0 mind of Sassouma Berete; she determined to kill Sogolon. Im great secrecy she had the foremost sorcerers of Mali come to her, but they all declared themselves incapable of tackling Sogolon. In fact, from twilight onwards, three owls23 came and perched on the roof of her house and watched over her. For the sake of peace and quiet Sassouma said to herself, 'Very well then, let him be born, this child, and then we'll see." Sogolon's time came. The king commanded the nine greatest midwives of Mali to come to Niani, and they were now constantly in attendance on the damsel of Do. The king was in the midst of his courtiers one day when someone came to announce to him that Sogolon's labours were beginning, He sent all his courtiers away and only Gnankouman Doua stayed by his side. One would have thought that this was the first time that he had become a father, he was so worried and agitated. The whole palace kept complete silence. Doua tried to distract the sovereign with his one-stringed guitar but in vain. He even had to stop this music as it jarred on the king. Suddenly the sky darkened and great clouds coming from the east hid the sun, although it was still the dry season. Thunder began to rumble and swift lightning rent the clouds; a few large drops of rain began to fall while a strong wind blew up. A flash of lightning accompanied by a dull rattle of thunder burst out of the east and lit up the whole sky as far as the west. Then the rain stopped and the sun appeared and it was at this very moment that a 1nidwife came out of Sogolon's house, ran to the antechamber and announced to Nare Maghan that he was the father of a boy. The king showed no reaction at all. He was as though in a daze. Then Doua, realizing the king's emotion, got up and sig.nalled to two slaves who were already standing near the royal 'tabala'. 24 The hasty beats of the royal drum announced to Mali 12 the birth of a son; the village tam-tams took it up and thus all Mali got the good news the same day. Shouts of joy, tam-tams and 'balafons' 26 took the place of the recent silence and all the musicians of Niani made their way to the .. palace. His initial emotion being over, the king had got up and on leaving the antechamber he was greeted by the warm voice of Gnankouman. Doua singing: 'I salute you, father; I salute you, king Nare Maghan; I salute you, Maghan Kon Fatta, Frako Maghan Keigu. 28 The child is born whom the world awaited. Maghan, oh happy father, I salute you. The lion child, the buffalo child is born, and to announce him the Almighty has made the thunder peal, the whole sky has lit up and the earth has trembled. All hail, father, hail king Nare Maghan!' All the griots were there and had already composed a song in praise of the royal infant. The generosity of kings makes griots eloquent, and Maghan Kon Fatta distributed on this day alone six granaries of rice among the populace. Sassouma Berete dis.tinguished herself by her largesses, but that deceived nobody. She was suffering in her heart but did not want to betray anything. The name was given the eighth day after his birth. á It was a great feast day and people came from all the villages of Mali while each neighbouring people brought gifts to the king. First thing in the morning a great circle had formed in front of the palace. In the mi.ddle, serving women were pounding rice which was to serve as bread, and sacrificed oxen lay at the foot of the great silk-cotton tree. In Sogolon's house the king's aunt cut off the baby's first crop of hair while the poetesses, equipped with large fans, cooled the mother who was nonchalantly stretched out on soft cushions. The king was in his antechamber but he came out followed. y Doua. The crowd fell silent and Doua cried, 'The child of Sogolon will be called Maghan after his father, and Mari Djata, a name which no Mandingo prince has ever borne. Sogolon's son will be the first of this name.'' Straight away the griots shouted the name of the infant and the tam~tams sounded anew. The king's aunt, who had come out to hear the name of the child, went back into the house, and whispered the double name of Maghan and Mari Djata in the ear of the newly-born so that he would remember it. The festivity ended with the distribution of meat to the heads of families and everyone dispersed joyfully. The near relatives one by one went to admire the newly-born. Childhood God has his mysteries which none can fathom. You, perhaps, will be a king. You can do nothing about it. You, on the other hand, will be unlucky, but you can do nothing about that either, Each man finds his way already marked out for him and he can change nothing of it. Sogolon's son had a slow and difficult childhood. At the age of three he still crawled along on all-fours while children of the sameá age were already walking. He had nothing of the great beauty of his father Nare Maghan. He had a head so big that he seemed unable to support it; he also had large eyes which would open wide whenever anyone entered his mother's house. He was_' taciturn and used to spend the whole day just sitting in the middle of the house. Whenever his mother went out he would crawl on all fours to rummage about in the calabashes in search of food, for he was very greedy." Malicious tongues began to blab. What three-year-old has not yet taken his first steps? What three-year-old is not the despair of his parents through his whims and shifts of mood? What three.year-old is not the joy of his circle through his backwardness in talking? Sogolon Djata (for it was thus that they called him, pre.fixing his mother's name to his), Sogolon Djata, then, was very different from others of his own age. He spoke little and his severe face never relaxed into a smile. You would have thought that he was already thinking, and what amused children of his age bored him. Often Sogolon would make some of them come to him to keep him company. These children were already walking and she hoped that Djata, seeing his companions walking, would be tempted to do likewise. But nothing came of it. Besides, Sogolon Djata would brain the poor little things with his already strong , arms and none of them would come near him any more. ,,-1 The king's first wife was the first to rejoice at Sogolon Djata's infirmity. Her own son, Dankaran Touman, was already eleven. He was a fin~ and lively boy, who spent the day running about ~he. v,!lage with those of his own age. He had even begun his m1t1at10n m the bush. 28 The king had had a bow made for him and he used to go behind the town to practise archery with his companions. Sassouma was quite happy and snapped her fingers at Sogolon, whose child was still crawling on the ground. When; ever the latter happened to pass by her house she would say 'Come, my son, walk, jump, leap about. The jinn' didn 1t promise' you anything out of the ordinary, but I prefer a son who walks on his two legs to a lion that crawls on the ground.' She spoke thus whenever Sogolon went by her door. The innuendo would g?str~ight home and then she would burst into laughter, that diabolical laughter which a jealous woman knows how to use so well. Her son's infirmity weighed heavily upon Sogolon Kedjou; she had resorted to all her talent as a sorceress to give strength to her son's legs, but the rarest herbs had been useless. The king himself lost hope. How impatient man is! Nare Maghan became imperceptibly estranged but Gnankouman Doua never ceased reminding h!m of the hunter's words. Sogolon became pregnant again. The kmg hoped for a son, but it was a daughter called Kolonkan. She resembled her mother and had nothing of her father's beauty. The disheartened king debarred Sogolon from his house and she lived in semi-disgrace for a while. Nare Maghan married the daughter of one of his allies, the king of the Kamaras. She was called Namandje and her beauty was legendary. A year later she brought a boy into the world. When the king consulted soothsayers on the destiny of this son he received the reply that Namandje's child would be the right hand of some mighty king. The king gave the newly-born the name of Bou.kari. He was to be called Mantling Boukari or Mantling Bory later on. á Nare Maghan was very perplexed. Could it be that the stiff.jointed son of Sogolon was the one the hunter soothsayer had foretold? á 'The Almighty has his mysteries,' Gnankouman Dona would say and, taking up the hunter's words, added, 'The silk-cotton tree emerges from a tiny seed.' One day Nare Maghan came along to the house of Nounfa!ri, the blacksmith seer of Niani. He was an old, blind mari. He received the king in the anteroom which served as his workshop. To the king's question he replied, 'When the seed germinates growth is not always easy; great trees grow slowly but they plunge their roots deep into the ground.' 'But has the seed really germinated?' said the king. 'Of course,' replied the blind seer. 'Only the growth is not as quick as you would like it; how impatient man is.' This interview and Dona's confidence gave the king some assurance. To the great displeasure of Sassouma Berete the king restored Sogolon to favour and soon another daughter was born to her. She was given the name of Djamarou. However, all Niani talked of nothing else but the stiff-legged son of Sogolon. He was now seven and he still crawled to get about. In spite of all the king's affection, Sogolon was in despair, Nare Maghan aged and he felt his time coming to an end. Dankaran Touman, the son of Sassouma Berete,was now a fine youth. One day Nare Maghan made Mari Djata come to him and he spoke to the child as one speaks to an adult. 'Mari Djata, I am growing old and soon I shall be no more among you, but before death takes me off I am going to give you the present each king á ' gives his successor. In Mali every prince has his own griot. Doua's father was my father's griot, Doua is mine and the son of Doua, Balla Fasseke here, will be your griot. Be inseparable friends from this day forward. From his mouth you will hear the history of your ancestors, you will learn the art of governing Mali according to the principles which our ancestors have bequeathed to us. I have served my term and done my duty too. I have done every. thing which a king of Mali ought to do. I am handing an enlarged kingdom over to you and I leave you sure allies. May your destiny be accomplished, but never forget that Niani is your capital and Mali the cradle of your ancestors.' The child, as if he had understood the whole meaning of the king's words, beckoned Balla Fasseke to apprpach. He made room for him áon the hide he was sitting on and then said, 'Balla, you will be my griot.' 'Yes, son of Sogolon, if it pleases God,' replied Balla Fasseke. The king and Dona exchanged glances that radiated confidence. 17 The Lion's Awakening looking after her onions and gnougous. 20 One day she happened to be short of condiments and went to the queen mother to beg a little baobab leaf. 30 A short while after this interview between Nare Maghan and his son the king died. Sogolon's son was no more than seven years old. The council of elders met in the king's palace. It was no use Dona's defending the king's will which reserved the throne for Mari Djata, for the council took no account of Nare Maghan's wish. With the help of Sassouma Berete's intrigues, Dankaran _ Touman was proclaimed king and a regency council was formed \ á in which the queen mother was all-powerful. A short time after, \ Dona died. 1 ~-As men have short memories, Sogolon's son was spoken of with nothing but irony and scorn. People had se.en one-eyed kings, one-armed kings and lame kings, but a stiff-legged kmg had never been hea;d tell of. No matter how great the destiny promised for Mari Djata might be, the throne could not be given to someone who had no power in his legs; if the jinn loved him, let them begin by giving him the use of his legs. Such were the remarks that Sogolon heard every day. The queen mother, Sassouma Berete,was the source of all this gossip. Having become all-powerful, Sassouma Berete persecuted Sogolon because the late Nare Maghan had preferred her. She banished Sogolon and her son to a back yard of the palace. Man Djata's mother now occupied an old hut which had served as a lumber-room of Sassouma's. The wicked queen mother allowed free passage to all those inquisitive people who wanted to see the child tha~ stiHcrawled at the age of seven. Nearly all the inhabitants of Niam filed mto the palace and the poor Sogolon wept to see hersel~ thus giv~n over to public ridicule. Mari Djata took on a ferocious look_ m front of the crowd of sightseers. Sogolon found a httle consolation only in the love of her eldest daughter, Kolonkan. She was four and she could walk. She seemed to understand all her mother's miseries and already she helped her with the housework. Some. times when Sogolon was attending to the chores, it was she who stayed beside her sister Djamarou, quite small as yet. Sogolon Kedjou and her children lived on the queen mother's left-overs, but she kept a little garden in the ope'.' ground behmd the village. It was there that she passed her brightest moments 18 'Lo_ok you,' said the malicious Sassouma, 'I have a calabash full. Help yourself, you poor woman. As for me, my son knew how to walk at seven and it was he who went and picked these baobab leaves. Take them then, since your son is unequal to mine.' Then she laughed derisively with that fierce laughter which cuts through your flesh and penetrates right to the bone. Sogolon Kedjou was dumbfounded. She had never imagined that hate could be so strong in a human being. With a lump in her throat she left Sassouma's. Outside her hut Mari Djata, sitting on his useless legs, was blandly eating out of a calabash. Unable to contain herself any longer, Sogolon burst into sobs ) and seizing a piece of wood, hit her son. 'Oh son of misfortune, will you never walk? Through your fault I have just suffered the greatest affront of my life! What have I done, God, for you to punish me in this way?' -Mari Djata seized the piece of wood and, looking at his mother, said, 'Mother, what's the matter?' 'Shut up, nothing can ever wash me clean of this insult.' 'But what then?' 'Sassouma has just humiliated me over a matter of a baobab leaf. At your age her own son could walk and used to bring his mother baobab leaves." 'Cheer up, Mother, cheer up.' 'No. It's too much. I can't.' 'Very well then, I am going to walk today,' said Mari Djata. 'Go and tell my father's smiths to make me the heaviest possible iron rod. Mother, do you want just the leaves of the baobab or would you rather I brought you the whole tree?' 'Ah, my son, to wipe out this insult I want the tree and .its roots at my feet outside my hut.' Balla Fasseke, who was present, ran Farakourou, to order an iron rod. Sogolon had sat down in front of her softly and holding her head between her to the master smith, hut. She was weeping two hands. Ma.ri Djata went calmly back to his calabash of rice and began eating again as if nothing had happened. From time to time he looked up discreetly at his mother who was murmuring in a low voice, 1! want the whole tree, in front of my hut, the whole tree.' All of a sudden a voice burst into laughter behind the hut. It was the wicked Sassouma telling one of her serving women about the scene of humiliation and she was laughing loudly so that Sogolon could hear. Sogolon fled into the hut and hid her face under the blankets so as not to have before her eyes this heedless . boy, who was more preoccupied with eating than with anything else. With her head buried in the bed-clothes Sogolon wept and her body shook violently. Her daughter, Sogolon Djamarou, had come and sat down beside her and she said, 'Mother, Mother, don't cry. Why are you crying?' Mari Djata had finished eating and, dragging himself along on his legs, he came and sat under the wall of the hut for the sun was scorching. What was he thinking about? He alone knew. The royal forges were situated outside the walls and over a hundred smiths worked there. The bows, spears, arrows and shields of Niani's warriors came from there. When Balla Fas. s0k0 came to order the iron rod, Farakourou said to him, 'The great day has arrived then?' 'Yes. Today is a day like any other, but it will see what no other day has seen.' The master of the forges, Farakourou, was the son of the old Nounfa!ri, and he was a soothsayer like his father. In his work.shops there was an enormous iron bar wrought by his father Nounfa!ri. Everybody wondered what this bar was destined to be used for. Farakourou called six of his apprentices and told them to carry the iron bar to Sogolon's house. When the smiths put the gigantic iron bar down in front q£Ule hut the noise was so frightening that Sogolon, who was lying down, jumped up with a start. Then Balla Fasseke, son of Gnankouman Doua, spoke. 'Here is the great day, Mari Djata. I am speaking to you, Maghan, son of Sogolon. The waters of the Niger can efface the stain from the body, but they cannot wipe out an insult. Arise, young lion, roar, and may the bush know that from henceforth it has a master.' The apprentice smiths were still there, Sogolon had come out and everyone was watching Mari Djata. He crept on all-fours and came to the iron bar. Supporting himself on his knees and one hand, with the other hand he picked up the iron bar without any effort and stood it up vertically. Now he was resting on nothing but his knees and held the bar with both his hands. A deathly silence had gripped all those present. Sogolon Djata closed his eyes, held tight, the muscles in his arms tensed. With a violent jerk he threw his weight on to it and his knees left the ground. Sogolon Kedjou was all eyes and watched her son's legs which were trembling as though from an electric shock. Djata was sweating and the sweat ran from his brow. In a great effort he straightened up and was on his feet at one go-but the great bar of iron was twisted and had taken the form of a bow! Then Balla Fasseke sang out the 'Hymn to the Bow', striking up with his powerful voice: 'Take your bow, Simbon, Take your bow and let us go. Take your bow, Sogolon Djata.' When Sogolon saw her son standing she stood dumb for a moment, then suddenly she sang these words of thanks to God who had given her son the use of his legs: 'Oh day, what a beautiful day, Oh day, day of joy; Allah Almighty, you never created a finer day. So my son is going to walk!' Standing in the position of a soldier at ease, Sogolon Djata, sup. ported by his enormous rod, was sweating great beads of sweat. Balla Fasseke's song had alerted the whole palace and people came running from all over to see what had happened, and each stood bewildered before Sogolon's son. The queen mother had rushed there and when she saw Mari Djata standing up she trembled from head to foot. After recovering his breath Sogolon's son dropped the bar and the crowd stood to one side. His first steps were those of a giant. Balla Fasseke fell into step and pointing his finger at Djata, he cried: 'Room, room, rnake room! The lion has walked; Hide antelopes, Get out of his way.' Behind Niani there was a young baobab tree and it was there that the children of the town came to pick leaves for their mothers. With all his might the son of Sogolon tore up the tree and put it on his shoulders and went back to his mother. He threw the tree in front of the hut and said, 'Mother, here are some baobab leaves for you. From henceforth it will be outside your hut that the women of Niani will come to stock up.' Sogolon Djata walked. From that day forward the queen mother had no more peace of mind. But what can one do against destiny? Nothing. Man, under the influence of cert~in ill1=1~ions, thinks he can alter the course which God has mapped out, but everything he does falls into a higher order which he barely understands. That is __V'/hYSassouma's efforts were vainá against Sogolon's son, e;;-erything she did lay in the child's destin,-. Scorned the day before and the object of public ridicule, now Sogolon's son was as popular as he had been despised. The mul.titude loves and fears strength. All Niani talked of nothing but Djata; the mothers urged their sons to become hunting com. panions of Djata and to share his games, as if they wanted their offspring to profit from the nascent glory of the buffalo-woman's son. The words of Doua on the name-giving day came back to men's minds and Sogolon was now surrounded with much á ~ respect; in conversation people were fond of contrasting Sogolon's modesty with the pride and malice of Soussouma Berate. It was because the former had been an exemplary wife and mother that God had granted strength to her son's legs for, it was said, the more a wife loves and respects her husband and the more she suffers for her child, the more valorous will the child be one day. Each is the child of his mother; the child is worth no more than the mother is worth. It was not astonishing that the king Dankaran Touman was so colourless, for his mother had never shown the slightest respect to her husband and never, in the presence of the late king, did she show that humility which every wife should show before her husband. People recalled her scenes of jealousy and the spiteful remarks she circulated about her co.wife and her child. And people would conclude gravely, 'No.body knows God's mystery. The snake has no legs yet it is as swift as any other animal that has four.' Sogolon Djata's popularity grew from day to day and he was surrounded by a gang of children of the same age as himself. These were Fran Kamara, son of the king of Tabon; Kamandjan, son of the king of Sibi; and other princes whose fathers had sent them to the court of Niani. 31 The son of Namandje, Mantling Bory, was already joining in their games. Balla Fasseke followed Sogolon Djata all the time. He was past twenty and it was he who gave the child education and instruction according to Man.dingo rules of conduct. Whether in town or at the hunt, he missed no opportunity of instructing his pupil. Many young boys of Niani came to join in the games of the royal child. He liked hunting best of all. Farakourou, master of the forges, had made Djata a fine bow, and he proved himself to be a good shot with the bow. He made frequent hunting trips with his troops, and in the evening all Niani would be in the square to be present at the entry of the young hunters. The crowd would sing the 'Hymn to the Bow' which Balla Fasseke had com.posed, and Sogolon Djata was quite young when he received the title of Simbon, or master hunter, which is only conferred on great hunters who have proved themselves. Every evening Sogolon Kedjou would gather Djata and his companions outside her hut. She would tell them stories about the beasts of the bush, the dumb brothers of man. Sogolon Djata 1 learnt to distinguish between the animals; he knew why the , , buffalo was his mother's wraith and also why the lion was the protector of his father's family. He also listened to the history of the kings which Balla Fasseke told him; enraptured by the story of Alexander the Great, 32 the mighty king of gold and silver, whose sun shone over quite half the world. Sogolon initiated her son into certain secrets and revealed to him the names of the medicinal plants which every hunter should know. Thus, be.tween his mother and his griot, the child got to know all that needed to be known. Sogolon's son was now ten. The name Sogolon Djata in the rapid Mandingo language became Sundiata or_ Sondjata. He was a lad full of strength; his arms had the strength of ten and his biceps inspired fear in his companions. He had already that authoritative way of speaking which belongs to those who are destined to command. His brother, Mantling Bory, became his best friend, and whenever Djata was seen, Mantling Bory appeared too. They were like a man and his shadow. Fran Kamara and Kamandjan were the 'closest friends of the young 23 princes, while Balla Fasseke followed them all like a guardian angel. llut Sundiata's popularity was so great that the queen mother became apprehensive for her son's throne. Dankaran Touman was the most retiring of men. At the age of eighteen he was still under the influence of his mother and a handful of old schemers. It was Sassouma Berete who really reigned in his name. The á queen mother wanted to put an end to this popularity by killing Sundiata and it was thus that one night she received the nine great witches of Mali. They were all old women. The eldest, and the most dangerous too, was called Soumosso Konkomba. When the nine old hags had seated themselves in a semi-circle around her bed the queen mother said: 'You who rule supreme at night, nocturnaJ powers, oh you who hold the secret of life, you who can put an end to one life, can you help me?' 'The night is potent,' said Soumosso Konkomba, 'Oh queen, tell us what is to be done, on whom must vve turn the fatal blade?' 'I want to kill Sundiata,' said Sassouma. 'His destiny runs counter to my son's and he must be killed while there is still time. If you succeed, I promise you the finest rewards. First of aU I bestow on each of you a cow and her calf and from tomorrow go to the royal granaries and each of you will receive a hundred measures of rice and a hundred measures of hay on my authority.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
