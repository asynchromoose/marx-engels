    AT FIRST SIGHT, the economy consists of two enormous areas: production and consumption. One completes and destroys; the other renews and starts afresh. 'A society cannot leave off producing any more than it can leave off consuming', wrote Marx.1 This seems a self-evident truth. Proudhon says much the same thing when he asserts that working and eating are the two apparent purposes of man's existence. But between these two worlds slides another, as narrow but as turbulent as a river, and like the others instantly recognizable: exchange, trade, in other words the market economy - imperfect, discontinuous, but already commanding in the centuries studied in this book, and without a doubt revolu­ tionary. In an overall structure which had an obstinate tendency towards a routine balance, and which left it only to revert to it, this was the zone of change and innovation. Marx called it the sphere of circulation2 a term I persist in finding a happy one. The word circulation, transferred from physiology to economics/ does, it is true, cover a multitude of things. According to G. Schelle,4 the editor of the complete works of Turgot, the latter once thought of writing a
Treatise on Circulation which  would have  dealt  with  banks,  Law's system,
credit, exchange and trade, and luxury in other words practically the entire economy as then conceived. But has not the expression market economy today, in turn, taken on a wider meaning which goes far beyond the simple notion of circulation and exchange?5
Three worlds then. In the first volume of this book, I gave pride of place to consumption. In the pages which follow, we shall be looking at circulation. The difficult problems of production will be tackled last of all. 6 Not that I would challenge the views of Marx and Proudhon that they are essential. But for the historian, looking backward in time, it is hard to begin with production, a baffling territory, difficult to locate and as yet inadequately charted. Circulation, by contrast, has the advantage of being easily observable. It is constantly in movement and draws attention to its movement. The clamour of  the market­
place has no difficulty in reaching our ears. I can without exaggeration claim to see the dealers, merchants and traders on the Rialto in the Venice of I5 30, through the very window of Aretino, who  liked  to  look  down at this  daily scene.7

26	The Wheels of Commerce
I can walk into the Amsterdam Bourse of 1688 or even earlier and feel quite familiar - I almost wrote 'free to speculate'. Georges Gurvitch would imme­ diately object that the easily observable may well be the secondary or the negligible. I am not so sure; and I do not believe that Turgot, who had to tackle the whole of the economy of his time, was so very mistaken in paying special attention to circulation. After all, the genesis of capitalism is strictly related to
exchange - is that negligible? Finally, production means division of labour and therefore forces men to exchange goods.
In any case, who would seriously think of minimizing the role of the market?
Even in an elementary form, it is the favoured terrain of supply and demand, of that appeal to other people without which there would be no economy in the ordinary sense of the word, only a form of life 'embedded' as English economists say, in self-sufficiency or the non-economy. The market spells liberation, open­ ness, access to another world. It means coming up for air. Men's activities, the surpluses they exchange, gradually pass through this narrow channel to the other world with as much difficulty at first as the camel of the scriptures  passing through the eye of a needle. Then the  breaches grow wider  and more frequent, as society finally becomes a 'generalized market society'.8 'Finally': that is to say with the passage of time, and never at the same date or in the same way in different regions. So there is no simple linear history of the development of markets. In this area, the traditional, the archaic and the modern or ultra-modern
exist side by side, even today. The most significant images are undoubtedly easy to find and collect, but not, even in the favoured case of Europe, to situate with precision in relation to one another.
Could it be that this lurking problem is also a consequence of the restriction of our field of observation - even though it runs from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century? The ideal field of observation would cover all the markets in the world, from the very beginnings to our own time - the huge area tackled with iconoclastic zeal by Karl Polanyi.9 But how can one include in the same explanation the pseudo-markets of ancient Babylon, the primitive exchange habits of the Trobriand Islanders in our own time, and the markets of medieval and pre-industrial Europe? I am not convinced that such a thing is possible.
In any case, we shall not begin by immersing ourselves in general explana­ tions. We shall begin with description: first of Europe, a vital witness and better known than any other. Then of countries outside Europe, for no description can even begin to lead to a valid explanation if it does not effectively encompass the whole world.


Europe: the wheels of commerce at the lowest level

Let us begin then with Europe. By the fifteenth century, the  most  archaic  forms  of exchange had already been eliminated there. All the evidence relating to prices

Ordinary markets like those of today
In their elementary form, markets still exist today. Survivals of the past, they are held on fixed days, and we can see them with our own eyes on our local market-places, with all the bustle and mess, the cries, strong smells and fresh produce. In the past, they were recognizably the same: a few trestles, a canopy to keep off the rain; stallholders, each with a numbered place,13 duly allotted in advance, registered, and to be paid for as authorities or landlords decreed; a crowd of buyers and a multitude of petty traders - a varied and active proletariat: pea-shellers, who had a reputation for being inveterate gossips; frog-skinners (the frogs came in mule-loads from Geneva14 or Paris15) , porters, sweepers, carters, unlicensed pedlars of both sexes, fussy controllers who passed on their derisory offices from father to son; secondhand dealers, peasants and peasant women recognizable by their dress, as were respectable townswomen looking
for a bargain, servant-girls who had worked out, so their employers complained, how to make something out of the shopping-money (to shoe the mule, ferrer la mule as they said) /6 bakers selling coarse bread on the market-place, butchers whose displays of meat encumbered the streets and squares, wholesalers ('gros-


The Instruments of Exchange	29
sers') selling fish, butter and cheese in large quantities);17 tax-collectors. And everywhere of course were the piles of produce, slabs of butter, heaps of veget­ ables, pyramids of cheeses, fruit, wet fish, game, meat which the butcher cut up on the spot, unsold books whose pages were used to wrap up purchases. 18 From the countryside there also came straw, hay, wood, wool, hemp, flax and even fabrics woven on village looms.
If this elementary market has survived unchanged down the ages, it is surely because in its robust simplicity it is unbeatable - because of the freshness of the perishable goods it brings straight from local gardens and fields. Because of its low prices too, since the primitive market, where food is sold 'at first hand'19 is
the most direct and transparent form of exchange, the most closely supervised and the least open to deception. Is it the most equitable? Boileau's Livre des Metiers (Book of Trades), originally written in 1270/° insists that it is : 'For it is clear that the goods come to the open market and there it can be seen if they are good and fair or not . . . for of things . . . sold on the open market,  all may have a share, poor and rich.' The German expression for this is Hand-in-Hand, Auge-in-Auge Handel - selling hand to hand, eyeball to eyeball;21 in other words immediate exchange: the goods are sold on the spot, the purchases are taken and paid for there and then. Credit is hardly used between one market and another. 22 This very ancient form of exchange was already being practised at  Pompeii, Ostia or Timgad, and had been for centuries or millennia before that: ancient Greece had its markets, as did classical China, or the Egypt of the Pharaohs, or Babylonia where exchange made its very eadiest appearance.23 European travel­ lers have described the multi-coloured splendours and the organization of the market 'of Tlalteco next to Tenochtitlan' (Mexico City) 24 and the 'regulated and policed' markets of Black Africa, where they were struck by  the  orderliness  of the market, if not by the abundance of goods on offer. 25 The origins of the markets of Ethiopia go back into the mists of time.26

Towns and markets
Markets in towns were generally held once or twice a week. In order to supply them, the surrounding countryside needed time to produce goods and to collect them; and it had to be able to divert a section of the labour force (usually women) to selling the produce. In big cities, it is true, markets tended to be held daily, in Paris for instance, where in theory (and often in practice) they were supposed only to be held on Wednesdays and Saturdays.27 In any case, whether intermittent or continuous, these elementary markets between town and countryside, by their number and indefinite repetition represent the bulk of all known trade, as Adam Smith remarked. The urban authorities therefore took their organization and supervision firmly in hand: it was a matter of vital necessity. And these were on-the-spot authorities, prompt to  react or devise regulations, and always keep­
ing a sharp eye on prices. In Sicily, if a vendor asked a price a single grana over
30	The Wheels of Commerce
the fixed tariff, he could be sent straight to the galleys! (One such case occurred on 2 July I6II at Palermo.)28 At Chateaudun/9 bakers who were third-time offenders were 'brutally tipped out of tumbrils, trussed up like sausages'. This practice dated back to I4I7, when Charles d' Orleans granted aldermen the right to inspect the bakeries, and the community did not succeed in having the torture banned until I602.
But supervision and penalties did not prevent the market  from  growing to meet demand and taking its place at the heart of urban life. Since people went there on set days, it was a natural focus for social life. It was at market that the townspeople  met,  made deals, quarrelled, perhaps  came  to blows; the  market
was the source of incidents later reflected in court cases which reveal patterns of complicity, and it was the scene of the infrequent interventions of the watch, sometimes spectacular, sometimes prudent.30 All news, political or otherwise, was passed on in the market. In  I5 34, the actions and intentions of Henry VIII
were criticized  aloud in the market-place of Fakenham in Norfolk.31  And  was there any English market down the ages where one would not have heard the vehement pronouncements of preachers? The impressionable crowd was  there to hear all sorts of causes, good and bad. The market was also the favourite place for all business or family agreements. 'At Giffoni, in the province  of Salerno, in the fifteenth century, we see from the lawyer's records that on market days, apart from the sale of produce and local artisans' wares, a higher percentage [than on other days] is recorded of land sale agreements, emphyteutic leases [i.e. those providing for fixed perpetual rent] donations, marriage , contracts and dowry settlements. '32 The market was a stimulus to everything - even, logically, the trade of the local shops. William Stout, a Lancaster shopkeeper at the end of the seventeenth century, hired extra help 'on market and fair days'. 33 This was no doubt a general rule - unless that is the shops were officially closed, as was often the case, on fair or market days.34
One  has  only to  sample  the wisdom of proverbs  to  see  how  central  the
market was to a whole world of relationships. Here are a few examples:35 'One can buy anything in the market but silent prudence and honour'; 'a man who  buys fish while it is still in the sea may only get the smell in the end'. If you are unskilled in the arts of buying and selling, ' the market will teach you'. Since no man is an island in the market, 'think of yourself but think of the market  too', that is of other people. The wise man, says an Italian proverb, 'val piu avere amici
in piazza che denari nella cassa', will prefer to have friends on the market-place
than money in a chest. To resist the temptations of the market-place is the image of wisdom in the folklore of Dahomey of today: 'When a seller calls "Come and buy", reply if you are wise: "I spend only what I have". '36
Markets increase in number and become specialized
Taken over by the towns, the markets grew apace with them. More and more markets appeared, overflowing from the small town squares which could no

longer contain them. And since they represented modernity on the march, their growth allowed no obstacle to bar their way:  they  could with impunity impose on their surroundings their congestion, their rubbish and their obstinate gath­ erings of people. The solution adopted was to send them to the outskirts of the towns, outside the walls and towards the suburbs. This was often done if a new market was to be set up: as one was in Paris on the Place St Bernard in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine (2 March 1643 ); or in October 1660 'between the Porte Saint-Michel and the moat of the city of Paris, the rue d'Enfer and the Porte
Saint-Jacques' .37 But the old rendez-vous in the city centres survived: indeed it was already quite a business even to shift them a little distance, for instance from the Pont Saint-Michel to the far end of the same bridge in 1667/8 or fifty years later from the rue Mouffetard to the nearby courtyard of the Hotel des Patriarches (May 1718) .39 The new did not chase out the old. And since city walls also moved as the urban centres expanded, markets which had been placed sensibly on the outskirts found themselves locked inside the towns, and remained there. In Paris, the Parlement, aldermen and (after 1667) the Lieutenant of Police, tried desperately to keep the markets within reasonable bounds: in vain. The rue Saint-Honore was impassable in 1678 because of 'a market which has unlawfully set itself up near and in front of the Quinze-Vingts butcher's in the rue Saint­ Honore, where on market days several women and stallholders, from the fields as
32	The Wheels of Commerce
well as from the city, spread out their produce right on  the  street  and  prevel free passage which should always be unhindered as [it is] one of the mo! frequented and considerable streets in Paris' .40 This was an obvious abuse, bl how could it be remedied? To clear one place meant filling up another.  Almm fifty years later, the little Quinze-Virigts market was still there, since we find th commissaire Brussel writing to his superior at the Chatelet: 'Today sir, I receive a complaint from the townspeople at the little market  of  the  Quinze-Vingts where I had gone for bread, about the mackerel-sellers who throw  away  th heads of their mackerel, which is most unpleasant by the infection it spreads it the market. It would be a good thing if these women were told to put  the  fish heads in baskets, which could then be emptied into a cart, as the pea-shellen have to.'41 Even more scandalous, because it took place on the parvis of Notre­ Dame during Holy Week, was the Bacon Fair, which was really a large market where the poor and not-so-poor of Paris came to buy hams and flitches of bacon. The public weighing-scales were set up under the very porch of the cathedral: which was therefore the scene of incredible jostling, as people tried to get their meat weighed before anyone else, as well as of much banter, practical jokes, and petty  thieving.  The  gardes-franf:aises themselves,  who  were  supposed  to  keep order were no better than the rest and the undertakers from the nearby Hotel­ Dieu permitted themselves many ludicrous pranks.42 None of this however prevented permission being given to the chevalier de Gramont in I669 to establish a 'new market between the church of Notre-Dame and the isle du Pallais'. Every Saturday, there were catastrophic traffic jams. The square was thick with people: how were religious processions or the queen's carriage to get through?43
When an open space became available of course, a market took it over. Every winter in Moscow when the Moskva river froze, shops, booths and stalls were set up on the ice.44 It was the time of year when goods could be easily transported over the snow by sled, and when meat and slaughtered animals were deep-frozen by the open air: just before and after Christmas, the volume of trade regularly increased.45 During the abnormally cold winters of the seventeenth century in London, people rejoiced to be able to hold on the frozen Thames all the festivities of Carnival which 'throughout England lasts from Christmas until after Twelfth Night'. 'Sheds which are taverns', huge sides of beef roasting over a fire in the open air, Spanish wine and spirits attracted the whole population, even the king himself on occasion (I3 January I677) .46 In January and February I 683, however, things were not so gay. Unprecedented cold gripped the city: at the mouth of the Thames, huge ice-floes were threatening ships which were frozen in. Food and goods ran short, prices tripled and quadrupled, and the roads were impassable with ice; and snow. City life took refuge on the frozen river: it became the route for provision carts and hired carriages; merchants, shopkeepers and artisans set up their stalls on the ice. A huge market sprang into existence, showing how great was the force of number in the enormous capital - so huge that a Tuscan
observer called it a 'grandissimo fair'. There immediately flocked to it of course

'charlatans, clowns and all the inventors of tricks to wheedle money out  of purses' .47 And the whole extraordinary gathering did leave in people's minds the memory of a fair: 'The Fair on the Thames' I683. A rather clumsy engraving commemorates the event without communicating all the picturesque bustle.48 The growth of trade everywhere led towns to construct covered markets (halls or halles), sometimes surrounded by open-air markets. The covered mar­ kets were usually permanent and specialized institutions. There were countless cloth halls.49 Even a minor town like Carpentras had one. so Barcelona built its ala dels draps over the Exchange (the Lonja) .Sl Blackwell Hall,s2 the cloth market of London, was built in I397, rebuilt in I558, burnt down in the Fire of London in I666, rebuilt again in I672, to huge dimensions. Sales were for a long time confined to certain days of the week, but became daily in the eighteenth century, and the 'country clothiers' fell into the habit of leaving unsold cloth there to be held over until the next market. In about I660, the hall had its factors, full-time employees, and a whole complicated administration. But even before this expan-
	

sion, Basinghall Street, where this complex building stood, was already ' the heart of the business quarter', even more so than the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice.53
There were of course different halls representing various goods. There were cornmarkets (in Toulouse as early as 1203 ) 54 and halls selling wine, leather, shoes, furs (the Kornhauser, Pelzhauser and Schuhhauser of German towns) ; in Gorlitz, in a region which produced the precious dyestuff, there was even a woad market.55 In the sixteenth century, the towns and cities of England saw a series
of markethalls with different names spring up, often at the expense of a wealthy local merchant disposed to be generous.56 In Amiens in the seventeenth century, the yarn market stood in the town centre, behind the church of Saint-Firmin­ en-Castillon, a stone's throw from the central or corn market: the weavers came every day there to fetch the yarn known as sayette, 'combed and degreased, and
usually spun on a small wheel'; this commodity was brought into town by the spinners from the nearby countryside.57 And in many places the butcher's stalls, lined up under a roof, were virtually covered markets too, in Evreux for in­ stance;58 in Troyes, where they were in a dark warehouse/9 in Venice where the Beccarie, the principal butchers' shops  of the city, were  brought  together  after
I339 a  few  steps from  the  Rialto  square, in the  former  Ca' Querini. The street

The Instruments of Exchange	35
and the canal were both renamed Beccarie after them, and the church of San Matteo, the butchers' church, stood here until it was destroyed in the early nineteenth century. 60
The word halle could mean several things then, from a simple covered market
to the mighty buildings and complicated organization of the Halles which were from a very early date 'the belly of Paris'. The immense machinery dates back to Philip Augustus.61 It was in his time that a great market was built on the Champeaux, near the churchyard of the Innocents which was not deconsecrated until very late, in I786.62 But during the great recession between I350 and I450, the Halles clearly deteriorated - because of the recession, undoubtedly, but also
because of competition from neighbouring shops. In any case the decline of the Halles was not a merely Parisian phenomenon. It was clear to see in other cities in the kingdom. Disused market buildings fell into ruins; some became rubbish dumps for the neighbourhood. The weavers' hall in Paris, 'according to the accounts of I484 to I487 was used at least in part as a garage for the King's gun-carriages'.63 Roberto S. Lopez's theory that religious buildings are a good economic indicator is well known:64 if the building of a church is interrupted, as was Bologna cathedral in I223, Siena Cathedral in I265 or the Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence in I30I-I 302, this is a sure sign of economic crisis. Can we promote market halls, whose history has never been written, to the dignified status of economic indicators? If so, one could suggest that business picked up in Paris from about I543-I 572, rather more towards the end than the beginning of this period. Francois I's edict of 20 September I543, registered by the Parlement on II October following, was only the first move in the new direction. Others followed. Their apparent aim was to make Paris more beautiful rather than to provide it with a powerful trading organism. And yet the return to a more active commercial life, the growth of the capital and the subsequent reduction, as the Halles were rebuilt, of the number of shops and selling-points in its neighbour­ hood, made the operation an exceptional commercial enterprise. By the end of the sixteenth century at any rate, the Halles, now newly reconstructed, were restored to their old level of activity of the days of Saint Louis. This was another 'Renaissance' of a sort.65
No map of the Halles can convey a faithful image of this huge combination
of covered spaces and open spaces, its pillars holding up the arcades of neigh­ bouring houses, and surrounded by a bustling commercial life on the fringes of the central market, taking advantage of the disorder and sprawl and creating more of both to its own profit. Savary (I76I) 66 says that the whole complex was no further modified after the sixteenth century: we should not take this literally: there were constant internal movements and shifts. And there were two inno­ vations in the eighteenth century: in I767, the corn hall was taken down and put up again on the site of the former Hotel de Soissons; at the end of the century, the seafood hall and the leather hall were rebuilt, and the wine hall was transferred
beyond  the  Saint-Bernard  gate.  And  plans  were  always  being put forward to

36	The Wheels o( Commerce
improve and - already - to relocate the Halles. But the huge complex (5°,00
square metres of land), stayed not unreasonably where it was.
Only the wool and cloth halls, saltfish and fresh seafood stalls were unde covered markets. But all round these buildings, clustering against them, werl open-air markets in corn, flour, butter, candles, tow, and well-ropes. Near thi 'pillars' which stood  all round, secondhand-clothes dealers, bakers, shoemaker: and 'other poor masters of the trades of Paris who have the right to the halls would dispose themselves as best they could. 'On 1st March 1657,' say tW( Dutch travellers,67 'we saw the second-hand clothes market, (la Friperie) nea the Halles.  This is  a large gallery, held  up  by stone pillars  under which all  the
sellers of old  clothes have  their stalls . . .  There  is a public market twice a week
. . . and it is then that all these dealers, among whom there are it seems a numbe of Jews, spread out their goods. At any hour going past there, one is assailed b their continual cries, "Here's a good  country coat!"  "Here's a  fine jerkin!" and by the patter about their merchandise with which they seek to draw people int their stalls . . . One can hardly believe the prodigious quantity of clothes an furniture they have: one sees some very fine things, but it is dangerous to bu unless one knows the trade well, for they have marvellous skill in restoring an patching up what is old so that it appears new.' As the stalls are badly lit, 'yo think you have bought a black coat, but when you take it into the daylight, it i green or purple or spotted like leopard-skin'. 
A collection of different markets one alongside another, surrounded by heap of rubbish, dirty water and rotten fish, the splendid Halles were 'also the mos vile and unhealthy quarter of Paris' , says Piganiol de la Force (1742).68 They wer equally the capital of loud-mouthed quarrels and strong language. The marke wives, more numerous than the men, set the tone: they had the reputation o having 'the foulest mouths in Paris'. 'Hee! Madame l'impudente! Parle done! He grande putain! T'es la garce des ecoliers! Vat Va au college de Montaigu! N devrois-tu pas avoil' honte? Vieille cal'casse! Dos (ouette! Impudente! Doubl vilaine, t'es soule jusqu'au gosiel" - such were the insults hurled by the fishwive of the seventeenth century - and in later times too no doubt.69

Intervention by the towns
Complicated and unique as the central market of Paris may have appeared,  i was but a reflection of the complexity and supply requirements of  a  big  city which had quickly grown beyond  all  normal proportions. When London  began its celebrated expansion, the same causes produced the same effects and the English capital was invaded  by a  multitude  of uncontrolled markets.  Unable to fit into the original spaces reserved for them, they spilled over into the nearby streets, which each became a sort of specialized market: fish, vegetables, poultry By Elizabethan times, they were expanding daily, and blocking up the busies thoroughfares of the capital. The great fire of 1 666 finally made reorganization

38	The Wheels of Commerce
possible. The city authorities, in order to clear the streets, put up large new buildings around  huge  courtyards:  these were closed markets,  but  open  to the air, some specialized and really wholesale markets, others more diversified.
Leadenhall, the biggest of all - some said it was the biggest in Europe was the one which afforded a sight most nearly comparable to the Paris Halles. It was undoubtedly more orderly. Leadenhall absorbed into its four buildings all the street-markets that had flourished before 1666 around its former site, those of Gracechurch Street, Cornhill, The Poultry, New Fish Street, Eastcheap. In one courtyard, a hundred butchers' stalls sold beef; in another, a further 140 stalls were reserved for other meats; elsewhere butter, fish, cheese, nails, ironmongery was sold. It was a 'monster market, an object of civic pride and one of the showpieces of the town'. The orderliness of which Leadenhall was a symbol did not of course last long. As it continued to expand, the city outgrew these wise solutions and found itself faced with the same old problems. By 1 699, and probably earlier, the stalls were once more spilling out on to the streets, taking up their positions under the porches of houses, and pedlars were spreading throughout the city, despite the prohibition on travelling salesmen. The most picturesque of the street criers of London were probably the fishwives, carrying their merchandise in baskets on their heads. They had a bad reputation, and were both reviled and exploited. After a good day, one was fairly sure of finding them in the tavern at night. And they were probably j ust as foul-mouthed and
aggressive as their counterparts in the Halles,1° to return to the subject of Paris. To be assured of supplies, Paris had to organize a huge region around the capital. Oysters and fish came from Dieppe, Crotoy, Saint-Valery. 'We meet nothing but catches of fish (des chasses mart§es),' writes a traveller who passed by these two towns in 1728 . But it was impossible 'to get hold of any of this fish which follows us on all sides . . . It is all bound for Paris'.71 Cheeses came from Meaux; butter from Gournay, near Dieppe, or from Isigny; beasts for slaughter from the markets of Poissy, Sceaux and further afield from Neubourg; good bread from Gonesse; pulses from Caudebec in Normandy, where a market was held every Saturday.72 Hence a series of regulations, forever undergoing change and revision. Their object was to protect the area which  directly supplied the city, to allow free rein to its producers, transporters and dealers, all the modest agents who saw to it that the great city's markets were kept constantly supplied. Professional merchants were therefore allowed to trade freely only outside this area. A police order from the Chatelet in 1622 extended to a radius of ten leagues the zone outside which merchants could handle corn supplies; the distance was seven leagues for meat on the hoof (1635); and twenty leagues for calves 'on grass' and hogs (1665); for freshwater fish it was four leagues, from the beginning
of the seventeenth century;73 and twenty for large-scale wine purchases.74 There were other problems too:  one  of the thorniest was the supply of horses
and of livestock. This was handled by noisy markets which were as far as possible kept on the outskirts of the city or outside it altogether. What eventually

The Instruments of Exchange	39
became the Place des Vosges, a piece of wasteland near the Tournelles, was for many years the site of a horse-market.75 Paris was thus permanently surrounded by a ring of markets, virtually a series of fatstock fairs. No sooner did one end than another opened the next day, with the same throng of people and animals. At one of these markets, probably Saint-Victor, eyewitnesses in 1667 reported seeing 'over three thousand horses [at a time] and it is most remarkable that there should be so many, since markets are held twice a week'. 76 In fact the horse trade penetrated the entire city: there were 'new' horses from the provinces or abroad, but mostly there were 'old horses . . . that is, which have already served'
secondhand beasts in other words, 'which the bourgeois [sometimes] wish to get rid of without sending them to market'; as a result there was a whole network of brokers and smiths, who acted as go-betweens for horse-dealers and stable­ owners. And every district had its livery stables.77
The big livestock markets were huge gatherings too, at Sceaux on Mondays, at Poissy on Thursdays at the four gates of the little town: (the Ladies' Gate, the Bridge Gate, the Conflans and Paris gates).78 A very active meat trade went on there through a chain of traitants, middlemen who paid in advance at the market (and were reimbursed later) go-betweens, rounders-up (griblins or batonniers) who went all over France buying up stock, and lastly butchers, who were by no
means all poor shopkeepers: some founded bourgeois dynasties.79 According to the records, in 1707, there were sold weekly on the Paris markets (in round figures) 1300 oxen, 8200 sheep and almost 2000 calves (100,000 per annum) . In 1707, the traitants or wholesalers 'who have taken hold both of the market at Poissy and the market at Sceaux, complain that sales take place [outside their control] all round Paris, at Petit-Montreuil for instance'. 80
It should be noted that the market for Paris's meat supply extended over a large area of France, as did the zones from which the capital regularly or irregularly drew its grain.81 This wide radius raises the question of routes and communications   such an enormous question that it  is difficult in a few words to suggest even its main lines. The most important feature of the system was probably the organization of the waterways to supply Paris: the Yonne, the
Aube, the Marne, the Oise running into the Seine, and the Seine itself. On its course through the city, the Seine had 'ports' - a total of 26 in 1754 which were at the same time large and extraordinary markets, giving the best value. The two most important were the port de Greve, where the downstream goods were landed: grain, wine, wood, hay (though for the latter the Tuileries port seems to have been more significant) ; and the port Saint-Nicolas82 where the upstream traffic landed. The river was alive with craft of all kind: ferries, or in the time of Louis XIV, bachoteurs, little boats for hire to clients, rather like the water-taxis83 or 'gondolas' which plied on the Thames upstream from London Bridge and which were often preferred to the bumpy ride of carriages.84
Complicated though it may appear, the case of Paris is not unlike that of several other cities. Any town of importance required a supply zone suited to its

own dimensions. Thus Madrid in the eighteenth century drew to excess on the means of transport of Castile, to the point of disrupting the country's entire economy.8S In Lisbon, if one is to believe Tirso de Molina (1 625) everything was simplicity itself: fruit, snow from the Serra d'Estrela, and food arrived by the all-providing  sea:  'The  inhabitants,  as  they  sit  eating  at  table,  can  see  the
fishermen's nets fill with fish . . . caught on their doorsteps.'86 It is a pleasure to the eyes, says an account of July-August 1633, to see the hundreds and thousands of fishermen's barks on the Tagus.87 Lazy, greedy, perhaps indifferent, the city seems from these accounts to be swallowing the sea. But the picture is too good to be true: in fact Lisbon had to labour endlessly to find enough grain for her daily bread. And the larger the population, the higher the degree of risk to supplies. Venice was already having to buy cattle for consumption from Hungary
in the fifteenth century. 88 Istanbul, which had a population in the sixteenth century of perhaps 700,000, ate flocks of sheep from the Balkans, and grain from the Black Sea and Egypt. But if the harsh government of the Sultan had not kept things firmly in hand, the huge city would have been struck by shortages, breakdowns in  supply and famines of tragic dimensions     and  indeed over the
years it was not entirely spared such misfortunes.89

The example of London
In its way, London is an exemplary case. It demonstrates, mutatis mutandis, everything we might have to say about these precociously tentacular metropol­ ises. And more historical research has been done on London than elsewhere, which enables us to draw conclusions going beyond the picturesque or the anecdotal. 90 N. S. B. Gras91 was right to see in London a typical example of Von Thiinen's rules on the zonal organization of economic space. Such an organization had even appeared around London a century earlier than it had around Paris. 92 The zone drawn upon by London was soon tending to cover virtually the entire area of production and trade in Britain. By the sixteenth century, at any rate, it stretched from Scotland in the north to the Channel in the south, from the North Sea in the east where the coastal shipping was essential to the capital's daily life - to Wales and Cornwall in the west. But within this space, there were some regions hardly or ineffectively exploited resistant even such as Bristol and the surrounding countryside. As in the case of Paris (and as in Von Thiinen's schema)
the farthest regions sent livestock: Wales had been drawn into the net by the sixteenth century and much later, after the Act of Union of 17°7, so was Scotland.
The beating heart of the London market was of course the Thames Valley, the area near the capital, with its easy access by waterway and a ring of staging-post towns (Uxbridge, Brentford, Kingston, Hampstead, Watford, St Albans, Hertford, Croydon, Dartford) which busied themselves in the city's service, grinding grain and sending in flour, preparing malt, dispatching food­ stuffs and manufactured goods towards the Great Wen. If we could look at a

series of pictures of this 'metropolitan' market, we should see it extending and expanding year by year, at the same pace as the growth of the town itself (250,000 inhabitants at most in I600, 500,000 or more by  I700) .  The  overall population of England was also growing at the time, but not as fast. So as one historian puts it, London 'is going to eat up all England'.93 And King James  I  himself said, 'With time England will be only London'.94 Such statements are both true and false: they underestimate and overestimate. What London was really 'eating up' was not merely the English interior, but also so to speak its exterior at least two-thirds, possibly three-quarters or four-fifths of its foreign trade.95 But even assisted by the triple appetite of the Court, the Army and the Navy,  London  did not swallow absolutely everything, nor draw everything irresistibly towards its wealth and high prices. Indeed national production even increased under its influence, in the English countryside as well as in the small towns 'which distributed more than they consumed'.96 The flow of services ran both ways, to some extent.
What was in fact being built under pressure from London, was the modernity of English life. The increasing prosperity of the surrounding countryside struck all travellers, who remarked on the servant-girls at the inns ('they could be
42	The Wheels of Commerce
mistaken for ladies of condition, being very neatly dressed') and the well-clothed peasants, who ate white bread, did not wear clogs like the French peasant, and even rode on horseback.97 But the whole of England, as well as distant Scotland and Wales, was touched and transformed by the tentacles of the urban octopUS.98 Any region affected by London tended to specialize, to change and become more commercially-minded, in limited sectors as yet it is true, for between the mod­ ernized regions there still lay expanses of the old rural regime with its traditional farms and crops. Kent for instance, south of the Thames and close to London, saw orchards and hops cover its fields to supply the capital, but Kent still retained its identity, with its peasant-farmers, its cornfields, livestock, thick forests (the haunt of highwaymen) and - an unmistakable index - its abundant wildfowl: pheasant, partridge, quail, teal, wild duck and the wheatear or English ortolan, 'the most delicious taste for a creature of one mouthful, for 'tis little more, that can be imagined' .99
Another effect of the organization of the London market was the dislocation (inevitably, in view of the scale of the enterprise) of the traditional open market, the public market where nothing could be concealed, where producer-vendor  and buyer-consumer met face to face. The distance between the two was becom­ ing too great to be travelled by ordinary people. The merchant, or middleman, had already, from at least the thirteenth century, made his appearance in England as a go-between for town and country, in particular in the corn trade. Gradually, chains of intermediaries were set up between producer and merchant on one hand, and btween merchant and retailer on the other; along these chains passed the bulk of the trade in butter, cheese, poultry produce, fruit, vegetables  and milk. Traditional habits and customs were lost or smashed. Who would have thought that the belly of London or the belly of Paris would cause a revolution? Yet they did so simply by growing.
Some statistics
Developments such as these would be much clearer to see if we had some figures, serial documents or overall balance-sheets. In fact it is possible to find such material and synthesize it, as is demonstrated by the map taken from Alan Everitt's excellent article (I967) on markets in England and Wales from I500 to
I640;100 by the map I have compiled of the markets in the generalite of Caen in
I722; or by the figures relating to Bavarian markets in the eighteenth century worked out by Eckhart Schremmer . 101 But these studies and others like them are only beginning to open up a promising area of research.
Setting aside the five or six exceptional villages which kept their markets, there were in the sixteenth and seventeenth century some 760 towns with one or more markets in England, and a further 50 in Wales, a total of about 800 localities with regular markets. Supposing the total population of the two countries to have been about 5.5 million inhabitants, each market town must have concerned on average the trading activities of 6000 to 7000 people, while

the average population of the locality itself was about 1000. So a market town might animate trade within a community six or seven times the size of its own population. Similar proportions can be found in Bavaria at the end of the eighteenth century: there was one market for every 7300 inhabitants.102 But this coincidence should not lead us to suppose that there is some sort of law. The proportions must surely have varied with region and period. And one must always check the method of calculation used.
We do know that there were probably more markets in England in the thirteenth century than in Elizabethan England, although the population was much the same size. The explanation must be either increased activity, and therefore a larger radius of influence for each locality in Elizabethan times, or a superabundance of markets in medieval England, possibly because noblemen, either as a point of honour or in hope of gain, set out to create markets. Everitt comments that 'perhaps the history of England's vanished market towns would be as interesting a study as its lost villages'.103
With the economic growth of the sixteenth century, especially after 1570,
new markets were set up, rising from their former ashes, or rather slumber. And what disputes they caused! Old charters were looked out to see who had or would have the right to collect market dues, who would be responsible for the equipment: 'lanthorne and market bell', cross, weighing-scales, the stalls, cellars or sheds to be hired, and so forth.
At the same time, on a national scale, a division of trade was becoming apparent between markets, according to the nature of the goods on offer, the
distances involved, the ease of access to transport or the lack of it, according, in short, to the geography both of production and of consumption. The 800 or so market towns counted by Everitt had an influence over an average radius of about seven miles. In about 1600, grain transported overland did not travel more than 10 miles, and 5 was more usual; cattle could be driven up to about 11 miles; sheep 40 to 70 miles; wool and woollen cloth would travel between 20 and 40 miles. Doncaster in Yorkshire, one of the biggest wool markets, had buyers coming, in the time of Charles I, from Gainsborough (21 miles), Lincoln (40 miles), 'Warsop' (25 miles), Pleasley (26 miles), Blankney (50 miles) . John Hatcher of Careby in Lincolnshire sold 'his wethers at Stamford, and his cows and oxen at Newark while he bought his steers at Spilsby, his fish at Boston, his wine at Bourne, and his luxuries in London'. 
This dispersion indicates how markets were gradually becoming more specialized. Of the 800 market towns of England and Wales, at least 300 confined themselves to single trades: 133 to the grain trade; 26 to malt; 6 to fruit; 92 to cattle markets; 32 to sheep; 13 to horses; 14 to swine; 30 to fish; 21 to wildfowl and poultry; 12 to butter and cheese; over 30 to wool or yarn; 27 or more to woollen cloth; 11 to leather; 8 to linen; at least 4 to hemp not to mention some very precise and idiosyncratic specialities: Wymondham dealt exclusively in 'wooden spoons, taps and handles'. 
44	The Wheels of Commerce
The specialization of the markets was of course accentuated in the eighteenth century, and not j ust in England. If we had the data to mark its statistical progress in the rest of Europe, we should have some kind of map of European growth to replace the purely descriptive information which is all we possess.
However, and this is the most important conclusion to be drawn from Everitt's work, with the increased population and economic growth of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, the existing network of regular markets became inadequate, in spite of specialization and concentration and despite the considerable contribution added by fairs - another traditional instru­ ment of exchange, of which more later.104 The increase in trade encouraged the

use of new channels of communication, freer and more direct. The growth of London contributed to this as we have seen. Hence the rise in the fortunes of what Alan Everitt calls, for want of a better term, private trading. This was simply a way of getting round the open or public market which was closely supervised. The initiators of such private trading were 'substantial' travelling merchants, pedlars and salesmen: they went round to the kitchen doors of farms to buy up in advance wheat, barley, sheep, wool, poultry, rabbit-skins and sheepskins. In this way, the market was reaching out into the villages. Sometimes the newcomers would hold court in inns, which were beginning a long career as substitutes for the market. They travelled about from county to county, making deals with a shopkeeper here, a pedlar or a wholesaler there. And they acted as wholesalers themselves or as middlemen of every description, willing to deliver barley to brewers in the Netherlands or to buy up rye in the Baltic to supply Bristol. Sometimes two or three of them would join together to share the risks. That the newcomer with the many faces was detested, hated for his cunning,
intransigence and hard-heartedness is abundantly clear from the court cases that cropped up. This new kind of trade, carried on by a simple written note binding upon the vendor (who was often illiterate) led to all kinds of misunderstandings and dramas. For the trader himself though, driving his pack-horses, or supervis­ ing grain being embarked on the waterways, the hard travelling life had its charms. He could cross the whole country from Scotland to Cornwall, finding at every inn friends or fellow-traders, and feeling that he belonged to a tough and intelligent confraternity - while  making a  very good living for himself.  This  was a revolution which went beyond the economy, into social behaviour. It is no accident, Everitt thinks, that these new trading activities developed  at the same
time as the appearance of the new political phenomenon of the Independents. At
the end of the civil war, when roads and highways were once more open to traffic, in about I647, Hugh Peter, a leading Independent divine, exclaimed:
Oh, the blessed change we see that can travel now from Edinburgh to the Land's End in Cornwall, who not long since were blocked up at our doors. To see the highways occupied again; to hear the carter whistling to his toiling team; to see
the weekly carrier attend his constant mart; to see the hills rejoicing, the valleys laughing.10s
