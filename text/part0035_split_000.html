His theoretical tract <span class="c1">Statehood and Anarchy</span> was published in 1873 and became a programmatic document. Bakunin was then both a sharp critic of Marx and a rival in working-class movements. Marx read and prepared a conspectus of Bakunin’s book in 1874–75, including in it the lengthy passages of rebuttal of Bakunin’s criticism that are presented here (the indented material consists of passages that Marx copied out in the conspectus, often interspersing his own ironic comments parenthetically). Because Marx and Engels said rather little about the specifics of the predicted “dictatorship of the proletariat” and about how they envisaged developments in the aftermath of the proletarian revolution, Marx’s comments in this obscure source are of great interest. The conspectus was first published in the journal <span class="c1">Letopisi marksizma</span> (Annals of Marxism) in 1926. It appears in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, <span class="c1">Werke</span>, Vol. 18 (Berlin: Dietz Verlag, 1962), pp. 599–642. This English translation is by Robert C. Tucker.</p>
