It gives a vivid preview of the revolutionary upheaval towards which Marx believed that the class struggle in all capitalist countries was irresistibly moving. It was, in a way, <span class="c1">Capital’s</span> conclusion stated in advance. Note the Hegelian terminology in Marx’s depiction of the proletariat becoming, in and through the warfare of labor and capital, a class not only in itself but also “for itself,” i.e., collectively conscious of itself and its revolutionary aims as a class.</p>
