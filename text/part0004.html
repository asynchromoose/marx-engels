  <body class="calibre"><div class="body"><span id="chapter-4" class="c"></span><p class="s7">Note on Texts and Terminology</p><p class="s8">The strange publishing history of Marx’s writings was foreshadowed by their author when, late in his life, someone asked about his complete works. “They would first have to be written,” he is said to have replied. Marx must have had in mind that much of what he had produced was still in unfinished manuscript and that his grand project of a multi-volume work, of which <span class="c1">Capital</span> would be only one part, was unlikely ever to be realized.<a id="footnote-ref26" href="part0057.html#footnote26" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">26</sup></span></a> As it turned out, he did not live even to prepare Volumes Two and Three of <span class="c1">Capital</span> for publication.</p><p class="s8">In 1894, after putting out Volume Three of <span class="c1">Capital</span>, Engels began making arrangements for a complete edition of Marx’s works and his own. But this project foundered upon his death in the following year, after which his papers and Marx’s came into the possession of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). For a long time, only limited efforts at publication were made. In 1902 Franz Mehring put out a collection of the earlier writings (1841–50), <span class="c1">Aus dem literarischen Nachlass von</span> <span class="c1">K. Marx, F. Engels und F. Lassalle</span> (Out of the Literary Legacy of Marx, Engels and Lassalle). Between 1905 and 1910 Marx’s multi-volume <span class="c1">Theories of Surplus Value</span> came out under the editorship of Karl Kautsky. A heavily (and tendentiously) edited four volumes of correspondence between Marx and Engels appeared in 1913.</p><p class="s8">But systematic full-scale publication of their writings began only after the creation in 1921, under Lenin’s personal sponsorship, of the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow. The Institute had the financial backing of the Soviet Communist Party and, in its first decade, the able, dedicated direction of David B. Riazanov. Between 1923 and 1927 the Institute obtained photocopies of the manuscripts and correspondence of Marx and Engels in the SPD’s archives, bought up manuscripts and letters owned by various individuals, and gathered early editions of individual works.<a id="footnote-ref27" href="part0057.html#footnote27" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">27</sup></span></a> An institution of comparable importance, the International Institute of Social History, was founded in Amsterdam in 1935 and became the repository of the SPD’s archives, which were endangered after the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933.</p><p class="s8">A first attempt at a full collection was the Marx-Engels Institute’s three volumes, published between 1927 and 1932, Marx and Engels, <span class="c1">Historisch-Kritische Gesamtausgabe</span> (Historical-Critical Collected Works, generally known as <span class="c1">MEGA</span>). A fuller edition was published in Russian between 1928 and 1946, 1n thirty-four volumes: Marx and Engels, <span class="c1">Sochineniia</span> (Works). In the mid–1950’s the Institute of Marxism-Leninism (as the Marx-Engels Institute had been renamed) commenced publication of a new, more complete edition in both German and Russian. The German edition is Marx and Engels, <span class="c1">Werke</span> (Works), 41 volumes (Berlin; Dietz Verlag, 1957–68). But this edition is still far from complete. The first seven volumes of the English translation of it, covering the period up to and including 1848, are now (1977) available in Marx and Engels, <span class="c1">Collected Works</span> (Moscow: Progress Publishers; New York: International Publishers; London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart). Multi-volume collections in English are presently coming out in the Marx Library series (New York; Vintage Books) and the Karl Marx Library series (New York: McGraw-Hill) Most of the principal writings of Marx and Engels are also available in individual editions in English. Still, the literary legacy is not yet entirely an open book. Thus the first full collection of the Marx-Engels correspondence for the New York <span class="c1">Daily Tribune</span> is only now coming out in English: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, <span class="c1">The Collected Writings in the New York “Daily Tribune,”</span> ed. T. Ferguson and S. J. O’Neil (New York: Urizen, 1977).</p><p class="s8">Meanwhile, a monumental effort at a truly complete edition in one hundred volumes—completion projected for the year 2000—has been announced as a collaborative project of the Moscow and East Berlin institutes of Marxism-Leninism. This new <span class="c1">MEGA</span>—its title is Marx and Engels, <span class="c1">Gesamtausgabe</span>—is to include all of Marx’s still unpublished notebooks, the preparatory materials for <span class="c1">Capital</span>, even his miscellaneous jottings.<a id="footnote-ref28" href="part0057.html#footnote28" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">28</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Riazanov is said to have remarked that Marx had to be translated twice: first from his hard-to-decipher handwriting into legible German, and then from German into Russian. Translators of Marx from German into other languages have had to resolve some special problems, arising in part from Marx’s use of Hegelian philosophical terminology. He made particularly heavy use of this terminology in his early writings, but it did not disappear from his later ones and those of Engels.</p><p class="s8">Pervasive in the “original Marxism” of Marx’s <span class="c1">Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts</span> <span class="c1">of 1844</span>, and recurrent in such later writings as the <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span> and even <span class="c1">Capital</span>, is the term <span class="c1">Entfremdung</span>, for which some translators have used “alienation” and others “estrangement.” Correspondingly, Marx’s <span class="c1">Selbstentfremdung</span> becomes either “self-alienation” or “self-estrangement.” In the translation of the 1844 manuscripts used here, Martin Milligan has used “estrangement” and “self-estrangement.” Thus the title of the famous section <span class="c1">Die entfremdete Arbeit</span> is rendered as “Estranged Labour.”</p><p class="s8">What becomes estranged from man, notably the product of his labor and the surrounding material world as the aggregate of such products, must first be created. The process of creation is called by Marx <span class="c1">Entaüsserung</span>, which is sometimes translated as “alienation” (as by Milligan in the 1844 manuscripts below), and sometimes, more literally, as “objectification.” The latter translation may cause confusion because Marx also employs the term <span class="c1">Vergegenständlichung</span>, which quite literally means (and is translated) “objectification.”</p><p class="s8">Another Hegelianism that Marx took over and that is central to an understanding of his thought—and that causes problems for the translator—is <span class="c1">Aufhebung</span> (from the verb <span class="c1">aufheben</span>), variously rendered in different translations (or even the same one) as “abolition,” “annulment,” “supercession,” and “transcendence.” Marx himself wrote “suspension” in a passage penned in English in the <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span>.<a id="footnote-ref29" href="part0057.html#footnote29" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">29</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">The source of the problem is the richness and specificity of the concept to which the word is attached. For Hegel, <span class="c1">Aufhebung</span> is the culminating movement in a dialectical process that proceeds from an initial stage of affirmation or creation through a subsequent negation to a final synthesis via “negation of the negation,” the latter being the nub of the dialectic. Hence Hegel emphasizes that the term has the twofold connotation of elimination and preservation: what undergoes <span class="c1">Aufhebung</span> is negated without being nullified. It is negated in its negative aspect but, thus transformed, continues to exist.<a id="footnote-ref30" href="part0057.html#footnote30" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">30</sup></span></a> The same, <span class="c1">mutatis mutandis</span>, holds for Marx. Thus in the 1844 manuscripts he speaks of the future communist revolution as the <span class="c1">Aufhebung</span> of private property and of man’s self-estrangement. Through its revolutionary appropriation by the proletarians, which Marx (at the close of <span class="c1">Capital</span>, Volume One, calls the “negation of the negation”) private property is annuled or abolished <span class="c1">qua</span> private property, but preserved in a—for Marx—higher form: the socialized means of production. Because the term has this twofold meaning, some translators vary the translation according to context, as the negative or positive connotation seems uppermost. Milligan, for example, in his translation of the 1844 manuscripts, translates <span class="c1">Aufhebung</span> in one sentence as “transcendence” (of man’s self-estrangement) and in another as “annulment” (of the state) (see p. 84, below). </p><p class="s8">One other term met very often in Marx yet often misunderstood—although not because of difficulty of translation—is “mode of production” (<span class="c1">Weise der Produktion</span>, alternatively <span class="c1">Produktionsweise</span>). One might easily suppose that it refers to instruments of production (Marx calls these <span class="c1">Produktionsmittels</span>) or state of technology, but such is not the case. Marx, to begin with, treats all forms of human activity under the aspect of production. So, in the 1844 manuscripts (see p. 85, below) he says that the family, state, law, morality, science, and art are so many <span class="c1">Weisen der Produktion</span>. And when he refers to “mode of production” in an economic context, he means a given way of carrying on production <span class="c1">as a social activity</span>—conditioned in every case, it is true, by a prevailing set of the means of production or state of technology. The mode of production is thus a form of productive activity, historically a form of labor, e.g., serf labor under feudalism or wage labor under capitalism. Marx’s term for the new mode of production which he envisages arising on the yonder side of history, after the worldwide proletarian revolution, is “associated” production. “Labor” will have been abolished (see <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span>, below, p. 193), not in the sense that individuals will sink into indolent inactivity, but that their productive activities will take on the character of free creative self-expression not performed for wages or acquisitive purposes. Productive activity, having undergone <span class="c1">Aufhebung</span> as labor, will continue in a new mode.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">As with any important thinker whose writings get translated, Marx presents not only particular translating problems but a more general issue: to what extent should felicity of expression be sought at the expense of closeness to the original text? There is no ideal solution; some compromise is the natural outcome. Yet when problems of exegesis are both difficult and stubbornly controversial, as here, there is something to be said for the position taken by Martin Nicolaus when he says of his translation of Marx’s <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span> that it “aims at a tight fit to the original, including the roughness of grammar etc. To attempt to ‘polish’ this text would have been to tamper with an essential part of its significance.” That applies with special force to a work that Marx left in raw manuscript. But then much of what he wrote finally came to light in that form.</p><div class="calibre1" id="calibre_pb_1"></div></div></body></html>
