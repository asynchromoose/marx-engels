He invested much time in their study and often indicated how important he considered their impact on society and political systems. Yet he left no developed account of his views on crises. The selection presented here comes from one of Marx’s most under-appreciated works, <span class="c1">Theories of Surplus Value</span>, a three-volume work which has sometimes been described as Volume Four of <span class="c1">Capital</span>.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">It is Chapter XVII of this work, and not <span class="c1">Capital</span> proper, that contains the best and most systematic discussion by Marx of economic crises. The discussion takes the form of an attack on Say’s Law of Markets. This was an argument, put forward by Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832) and James Mill (1773–1836) and accepted by David Ricardo (1772–1823), for the impossibility of a sustained general glut (of “overproduced” commodities). It is interesting that Marx’s attack, like modern criticism of Say, centers on the potentially grave consequences for economic equilibrium of the generalization of the money economy.<a id="footnote-ref294" href="part0057.html#footnote294" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">294</sup></span></a></p>
