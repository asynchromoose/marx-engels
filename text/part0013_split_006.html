<p class="s33">Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">(6) This is perhaps the place at which, by way of explaining and justifying the ideas here presented, we might offer some considerations in regard to the Hegelian dialectic generally and especially its exposition in the <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span> and <span class="c1">Logic</span>, and also, lastly, the relation to it of the modern critical movement.</p><p class="s8">So powerful was modern German criticism’s preoccupation with the past—so completely was it possessed in its development by its subject-matter—that there prevailed a completely uncritical attitude to the method of criticizing, together with a complete lack of awareness about the <span class="c1">seemingly formal</span>, but really <span class="c1">vital</span> question: how do we now stand as regards the Hegelian <span class="c1">dialectic?</span> This lack of awareness about the relationship of modern criticism to the Hegelian philosophy as a whole and especially to the Hegelian dialectic has been so great that critics like <span class="c1">Strauss</span> and <span class="c1">Bruno Bauer</span> still remain wholly within the confines of the Hegelian Logic; the former completely so and the latter at least implicitly so in his <span class="c1">Synoptics</span><a id="footnote-ref130" href="part0057.html#footnote130" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">130</sup></span></a> (where, in opposition to Strauss, he replaces the substance of “abstract nature” by the “self-consciousness” of abstract man) and even in <span class="c1">Christianity Discovered</span>.<a id="footnote-ref131" href="part0057.html#footnote131" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">131</sup></span></a> Thus in <span class="c1">Christianity Discovered</span>, for example, you get:</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s21">“As though in positing the world, self-consciousness posits that which is different from itself, and in what it posits it posits itself, because it in turn annuls the difference between what it has posited and itself, inasmuch as it itself has being only in the positing and the movement.—How then can it not have its purpose in this movement?” etc.; or again: “They” (the French materialists) “have not yet been able to see that it is only as the movement of self-consciousness that the movement of the universe has actually come to be for itself, and achieved unity with itself.” </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Such expressions do not even show any verbal divergence from the Hegelian approach, but on the contrary, repeat it word for word.</p><p class="s8">How little consciousness there was in relation to the Hegelian dialectic during the act of criticism (Bauer, <span class="c1">The Synoptics</span>), and how little this consciousness came into being even after the act of material criticism is proved by Bauer when, in his <span class="c1">The Good of Freedom</span>,<a id="footnote-ref132" href="part0057.html#footnote132" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">132</sup></span></a> he dismisses the brash question put by Herr Gruppe—“What about logic now?”—by referring him to future critics.</p><p class="s8">But even now—now that <span class="c1">Feuerbach</span> both in his <span class="c1">Theses</span> in the <span class="c1">Anecdotis</span> and, in detail, in <span class="c1">The Philosophy of the Future</span>, has in principle overthrown the old dialectic and philosophy; now that that school of criticism, on the other hand, which was incapable of accomplishing this has all the same seen it accomplished and has proclaimed itself pure resolute, absolute criticism—criticism that has come into the clear with itself; now that this criticism, in its spiritual pride, has reduced the whole process of history to the relation between the rest of the world and itself (the rest of the world, in contrast to itself, falling under the category of “the masses”) and dissolved all dogmatic antithesis into the <span class="c1">single</span> dogmatic antithesis of its own cleverness and the stupidity of the world—the antithesis of the critical Christ and Mankind, the <span class="c1">rabble;</span> now that daily and hourly it has demonstrated its own excellence against the dullness of the masses; now, finally, that it has proclaimed the critical <span class="c1">Last Judgement</span> in the shape of an announcement that the day is approaching when the whole of expiring humanity will assemble before it and be sorted by it into groups, each particular mob receiving its <span class="c1">testimonium paupertatis;</span><a id="footnote-ref133" href="part0057.html#footnote133" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">133</sup></span></a> now that it has made known in print<a id="footnote-ref134" href="part0057.html#footnote134" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">134</sup></span></a> its superiority to human feelings as well as its superiority to the world, over which it sits enthroned in sublime solitude, only letting fall from time to time from its sarcastic lips the ringing laughter of the Olympian Gods—even now, after all these delightful antics of moribund idealism in the guise of criticism (i.e., of Young-Hegelianism)—even now it has not expressed the suspicion that the time was ripe for a critical settling of accounts with the mother of Young-Hegelianism—the Hegelian dialectic—and even had [nothing] to say about its critical attitude towards the Feuerbachian dialectic. Criticism with a completely uncritical attitude to itself! </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Feuerbach</span> is the only one who has a <span class="c1">serious, critical</span> attitude to the Hegelian dialectic and who has made genuine discoveries in this field. He is in fact the true conqueror of the old philosophy. The extent of his achievement, and the unpretentious simplicity with which he, Feuerbach, gives it to the world, stand in striking contrast to the reverse.</p><p class="s8">Feuerbach’s great achievement is:</p><p class="s8">(1) The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thoughts and thinking expounded, and that it has therefore likewise to be condemned as another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man;</p><p class="s8">(2) The establishment of <span class="c1">true materialism</span> and of <span class="c1">real science</span>, since Feuerbach also makes the social relationship “of man to man” the basic principle of the theory;</p><p class="s8">(3) His opposing to the negation of the negation, which claims to be the absolute positive, the self-supporting positive, positively grounded on itself.</p><p class="s8">Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic (and thereby justifies starting out from the positive, from sense-certainty) as follows: </p><p class="s8">Hegel sets out from the estrangement of Substance (in Logic, from the Infinite, the abstractly universal)—from the absolute and fixed abstraction; which means, put popularly, that he sets out from religion and theology.</p><p class="s8">Secondly, he annuls the infinite, and establishes the actual, sensuous, real, finite, particular (philosophy—annulment of religion and theology).</p><p class="s8">Thirdly, he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction, the infinite—restoration of religion and theology.</p><p class="s8">Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation <span class="c1">only</span> as a contradiction of philosophy with itself—as the philosophy which affirms theology (the transcendent, etc.) after having denied it, and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself.</p><p class="s8">The position or self-affirmation and self-confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself, which is therefore burdened with its opposite, which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof, and which, therefore, is not a position establishing itself by its existence—not a position that justifies itself; hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the self-grounded position of sense-certainty.<a id="footnote-ref135" href="part0057.html#footnote135" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">135</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it as the true and only positive, and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and self-realizing act of all being, he has only found the <span class="c1">abstract, logical, speculative</span> expression for the movement of history; and this historical process is not yet the real history of man—of man as a given subject, but only man’s <span class="c1">act of genesis</span>—the <span class="c1">story </span>of man’s <span class="c1">origin</span>. We shall explain both the abstract form of this process and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism, that is, in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach’s <span class="c1">Wesen des Christentums (Essence of Christianity)</span>, or rather the <span class="c1">critical </span>form of this in Hegel still uncritical process.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_12">Let us take a look at the Hegelian system. One must begin with Hegel’s <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span>, the true point of origin and the secret of the Hegelian philosophy.</p>
