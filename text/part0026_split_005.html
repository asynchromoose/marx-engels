<p class="s33">The Contradiction Between the Impetuous</p><p class="s33">Development of the Productive Powers and the</p><p class="s33">Limitations of Consumption Leads to Over-Production. </p><p class="s33">The Theory of the Impossibility of General </p><p class="s33">Over-Production Is Essentially Apologetic in Tendency.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The word <span class="c1">over-production</span> in itself leads to error. So long as the most urgent needs of a large part of society are not satisfied, or <span class="c1">only</span> the most immediate needs are satisfied, there can of course be absolutely no talk of an <span class="c1">over-production of products</span>—in the sense that the amount of products is excessive in relation to the need for them. On the contrary, it must be said that on the basis of capitalist production, there is constant <span class="c1">under-production</span> in this sense. The limits to production are set by the profit of the capitalist and in no way by the needs of the producers. But over-production of products and over-production of <span class="c1">commodities</span> are two entirely different things. If Ricardo thinks that the <span class="c1">commodity</span> form makes no difference to the product, and furthermore, that <span class="c1">commodity circulation</span> differs only formally from barter, that in this context the exchange-value is only a fleeting form of the exchange of things, and that money is therefore merely a formal means of circulation—then this in fact is in line with his presupposition that the bourgeois mode of production is the absolute mode of production, hence it is a mode of production without any definite specific characteristics, its distinctive traits are merely formal. He cannot therefore admit that the bourgeois mode of production contains within itself a barrier to the free development of the productive forces, a barrier which comes to the surface in crises and, in particular, in <span class="c1">over-production</span>—the basic phenomenon in crises.</p><p class="s8">Ricardo saw from the passages of Adam Smith, which he quotes, approves, and therefore also repeats, that the limitless “desire” for all kinds of use-values is always satisfied on the basis of a state of affairs in which the mass of producers remains more or less restricted to necessities—“food” and other “necessaries”—that consequently this great majority of producers remains more or less excluded from the consumption of wealth—in so far as wealth goes beyond the bounds of the necessary means of subsistence.</p><p class="s8">This was indeed also the case, and to an even higher degree, in the ancient mode of production which depended on slavery. But the ancients never thought of transforming the surplus-product into capital. Or at least only to a very limited extent. (The fact that the hoarding of treasure in the narrow sense was widespread among them shows how much surplus-product lay completely idle.) They used a large part of the surplus-product for unproductive expenditure on art, religious works and public works. Still less was their production directed to the release and development of the material productive forces—division of labour, machinery, the application of the powers of nature and science to private production. In fact, by and large, they never went beyond handicraft labour. The wealth which they produced for private consumption was therefore relatively small and only appears great because it was amassed in the hands of a few persons, who, incidentally, did not know what to do with it. Although, therefore, there was no <span class="c1">over-production</span> among the ancients, there was <span class="c1">over-consumption</span> by the rich, which in the final periods of Rome and Greece turned into mad extravagance. The few trading peoples among them lived partly at the expense of all these essentially poor nations. It is the unconditional development of the productive forces and therefore mass production on the basis of a mass of producers who are confined within the bounds of the necessary means of subsistence on the one hand and on the other, the barrier set up by the capitalists’ profits, which [forms] the basis of modern over-production.</p><p class="s8">All the objections which Ricardo and others raise against over-production etc. rest on the fact that they regard bourgeois production either as a mode of production in which no distinction exists between purchase and sale—direct barter—or as <span class="c1">social</span> production, implying that society, as if according to a plan, distributes its means of production and productive forces in the degree and measure which is required for the fulfilment of the various social needs, so that each sphere of production receives the <span class="c1">quota</span> of social capital required to satisfy the corresponding need. This fiction arises entirely from the inability to grasp the specific form of bourgeois production and this inability in turn arises from the obsession that bourgeois production is production as such, just like a man who believes in a particular religion and sees it as <span class="c1">the</span> religion, and everything outside of it only as <span class="c1">false</span> religions.</p><p class="s8">On the contrary, the question that has to be answered is: since, on the basis of capitalist production, everyone works for himself and a particular labour must at the same time appear as its opposite, as abstract general labour and in this form as social labour—how is it possible to achieve the necessary balance and interdependence of the various spheres of production, their dimensions and the proportions between them, except through the constant neutralisation of a constant disharmony? This is admitted by those who speak of adjustments through competition, for these adjustments always presuppose that there is something to adjust, and therefore that harmony is always only a result of the movement which neutralises the existing disharmony.</p><p class="s8">That is why Ricardo admits that a glut of certain commodities is possible. What is supposed to be <span class="c1">impossible</span> is only a simultaneous general glut of the market. The possibility of over-production in any particular sphere of production is therefore not denied. It is the <span class="c1">simultaneity</span> of this phenomenon for <span class="c1">all</span> spheres of production which is said to be impossible and therefore makes impossible [general] over-production and thus a general glut of the market. (This expression must always be taken <span class="c1">cum grano salis</span>, since in times of general over-production, the over-production in some spheres is always only the <span class="c1">result</span>, the <span class="c1">consequence</span>, of over-production in the leading articles of commerce; [it is] always only <span class="c1">relative</span>, i.e., over-production because over-production exists in other spheres.)</p><p class="s8">Apologetics turns this into its very opposite. [There is only] over-production in the leading articles of commerce, in which alone, active over-production shows itself—these are on the whole articles which can only be produced on a mass scale and by factory methods (also in agriculture), because over-production exists in those articles in which relative or passive over-production manifests itself. According to this, over-production only exists because over-production is not universal. The <span class="c1">relativity</span> of over-production—that actual over-production in a few spheres calls forth over-production in others—is expressed in this way: There is no <span class="c1">universal</span> over-production, because if over-production were universal, all spheres of production would retain the same relation to one another; therefore <span class="c1">universal</span> over-production is proportional production which excludes over-production. And this is supposed to be an argument against universal over-production. For, since <span class="c1">universal over-production</span> in the absolute sense would not be over-production but only a greater than usual development of the productive forces in all spheres of production, it is alleged that <span class="c1">actual over-production</span>, which is precisely not this non-existent, self-abrogating over-production, does <span class="c1">not</span> exist—although it only exists because it is not this.</p><p class="s8">If this miserable sophistry is more closely examined, it amounts to this: Suppose, that there is over-production in iron, cotton goods, linen, silk, woollen cloth etc.; then it cannot be said, for example, that too little coal has been produced and that this is the reason for the above over-production. For that over-production of iron etc. involves an exactly similar over-production of coal, as, say, the over-production of woven cloth does of yarn. (Over-production of yarn as compared with cloth, iron as compared with machinery, etc., could occur. This would always be a relative over-production of constant capital.) There cannot, therefore, be any question of the under-production of those articles whose over-production is implied because they enter as an element, raw material, auxiliary material or means of production, into those articles (the “particular commodity of which too much may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it” (pp. 341–42), whose positive over-production is precisely the fact to be explained. Rather, it is a question of other articles which belong directly to [other] spheres of production and [can] neither [be] subsumed under the leading articles of commerce which, according to the assumption, have been over-produced, nor be attributed to spheres in which, because they supply the <span class="c1">intermediate product</span> for the leading articles of commerce, production must have reached at least the same level as in the final phases of the product—although there is nothing to prevent production in those spheres from having gone even further ahead thus causing an over-production within the over-production. For example, although sufficient coal must have been produced in order to keep going all those industries into which coal enters as necessary condition of production, and therefore the <span class="c1">over-production</span> of coal is implied in the <span class="c1">over-production</span> of iron, yarn etc. (even if coal was produced only in proportion to the production of iron and yarn [etc.]), it is <span class="c1">also</span> possible that more coal was produced than was required even for the over-production of iron, yarn etc. This is not only possible, but very probable. For <span class="c1">the production of coal and yarn</span> and of all other spheres of production which produce only the conditions or earlier phases of a product to be completed in another sphere, is governed not by the immediate demand, by the immediate production or reproduction, but by the <span class="c1">degree, measure, proportion</span> in which these are expanding. And it is self-evident that in this calculation, the target may well be overshot. Thus not enough has been produced of other articles such as, for example, pianos, precious stones, etc., they have been <span class="c1">under-produced</span>. (There are, however, also cases where the over-production of non-leading articles is not the result of over-production, but where, on the contrary, <span class="c1">under-production</span> is the cause of over-production, as for instance when there has been a failure in the grain crop or the cotton crop.) </p><p class="s8">The absurdity of this statement becomes particularly marked if it is applied to the international scene, as it has been by Say and others after him. For instance, that England has not <span class="c1">over-produced</span> but Italy has <span class="c1">under-produced</span>. There would have been no over-production, if in the first place Italy had enough capital to replace the English capital exported to Italy in the form of commodities; and secondly if Italy had invested this capital in such a way that it produced those particular articles which are required by English capital—partly in order to replace itself and partly in order to replace the revenue yielded by it. Thus the fact of the actually existing <span class="c1">over-production in England</span>—in relation to the <span class="c1">actual </span>production in Italy—would not have existed, but only the fact of <span class="c1">imaginary under-production in Italy;</span> imaginary only because it presupposes a capital in Italy and a development of the productive forces that do not exist there, and secondly because it makes the equally utopian assumption, that this capital which does <span class="c1">not</span> exist in Italy, has been employed in exactly the way required to make English supply and Italian demand, English and Italian production, complementary to each other. In other words, this means nothing but: there would be no over-production, if demand and supply corresponded to each other; if the capital were distributed in such proportions in all spheres of production, that the production of one article involved the consumption of the other, and thus its own consumption. There would be no over-production, if there were no over-production. Since, however, capitalist production can allow itself free rein only in certain spheres, under certain conditions, there could be no capitalist production at all if it had to develop simultaneously and evenly in all spheres. Because absolute over-production takes place in certain spheres, relative over-production occurs also in the spheres where there has been no over-production.</p><p class="s8">This explanation of over-production in one field by under-production in another field therefore means merely that if production were proportionate, there would be no over-production. The same could be said if demand and supply corresponded to each other, or if all spheres provided equal opportunities for capitalist production and its expansion—division of labor, machinery, export to distant markets etc., mass production, i.e., if all countries which traded with one another possessed the same capacity for production (and indeed for different and complementary production). Thus over-production takes place because all these pious wishes are not fulfilled. Or, in even more abstract form: There would be no over-production in one place, if over-production took place to the same extent everywhere. But there is not enough capital to over-produce so universally, and therefore there is partial over-production.</p><p class="s8">Let us examine this fantasy more closely:</p><p class="s8">It is admitted that there can be over-production in <span class="c1">each particular</span> industry. The only circumstance which could prevent over-production in <span class="c1">all</span> industries simultaneously is, according to the assertions made, the fact that commodity exchanges against commodity—i.e., recourse is taken to the supposed conditions of barter. But this loop-hole is blocked by the very fact that trade [under capitalist conditions) is not barter, and that therefore the seller of a commodity is not necessarily at the same time the buyer of another. This whole subterfuge then rests on abstracting from <span class="c1">money</span> and from the fact that we are not concerned with the exchange of products, but with the circulation of commodities, an essential part of which is the separation of purchase and sale.</p><p class="s8">The circulation of capital contains within itself the <span class="c1">possibilities</span> of interruptions. In the reconversion of money into its conditions of production, for example, it is not only a question of transforming money into the same use-values (in kind), but for the repetition of the reproduction process [it is] essential that these use-values can again be obtained at their old value (at a lower value would of course be even better). A very significant part of these elements of reproduction, which consists of raw materials, can however rise in price for two reasons. <span class="c1">Firstly,</span> if the instruments of production increase more rapidly than the amount of raw materials that can be provided at the given time. <span class="c1">Secondly,</span> as a result of the variable character of the harvests. That is why weather conditions, as Tooke rightly observes, play such an important part in modern industry. (The same applies to the means of subsistence in relation to wages.) The reconversion of money into commodity can thus come up against difficulties and can create the possibilities of crisis, just as well as can the conversion of commodity into money. When one examines simple circulation—not the circulation of capital—these difficulties do not arise. (There are, besides, a large number of other factors, conditions, possibilities of crises, which can only be examined when considering the concrete conditions, particularly the competition of capitals and credit.)</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">The over-production of commodities</span> is denied but the <span class="c1">over-production of capital</span> is admitted. Capital itself however consists of commodities or, in so far as it consists of money, it must be reconverted into commodities of one kind or another, in order to be able to function as capital. What then does <span class="c1">over-production of capital</span> mean? Over-production of value destined to produce surplus-value or, if one considers the material content, over-production of commodities destined for reproduction—that is, <span class="c1">reproduction on too large a scale</span>, which is the same as over-production pure and simple. </p><p class="s8">Defined more closely, this means nothing more than that too much has been produced for the purpose of <span class="c1">enrichment</span>, or that too great a part of the product is intended not for consumption as revenue, but <span class="c1">for making more money</span> (for accumulation): not to satisfy the personal needs of its owner, but to give him money, abstract social riches and capital, more power over the labour of others, i.e., to increase this power. This is what one side says. (Ricardo denies it.) And the other side, how does it explain the over-production of commodities? By saying that production is not sufficiently diversified, that certain articles of consumption have not been produced in sufficiently large quantities. That it is not a matter of industrial consumption is obvious, for the manufacturer who over-produces linen, thereby necessarily increases his demand for yarn, machinery, labour etc. It is therefore a question of personal consumption. Too much linen has been produced, but perhaps too few oranges. Previously the existence of money was denied, in order to show [that there was no] separation between sale and purchase. Here the existence of capital is denied, in order to transform the capitalists into people who carry out the simple operation C—M—C and who produce for individual consumption and not <span class="c1">as</span> capitalists with the aim of enrichment, i.e., the reconversion of part of the surplus-value into capital. But the statement that there is <span class="c1">too much capital</span>, after all means merely that too little is consumed as <span class="c1">revenue</span>, and that more cannot be consumed in the given conditions. (<span class="c1">Sismondi.</span>) Why does the producer of linen demand from the producer of corn, that he should consume more linen, or the latter demand that the linen manufacturer should consume more corn? Why does the man who produces linen not himself convert a larger part of his revenue (surplus-value) into linen and the farmer into corn? So far as each individual is concerned, it will be admitted that his desire for capitalisation (apart from the limits of his needs) prevents him from doing this. But for all of them collectively, this is not admitted.</p><p class="s8">(We are entirely leaving out of account here that element of crises which arises from the fact that commodities are reproduced more cheaply than they were produced. Hence the depreciation of the commodities on the market.)</p><p class="s8">In world market crises, all the contradictions of bourgeois production erupt collectively; in particular crises (<span class="c1">particular</span> in their content and in extent) the eruptions are only sporadical, isolated and one-sided. </p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_10"><span class="c1">Over-production</span> is specifically conditioned by the general law of the production of capital: to produce to the limit set by the productive forces, that is to say, to exploit the maximum amount of labour with the given amount of capital, without any consideration for the actual limits of the market or the needs backed by the ability to pay; and this is carried out through continuous expansion of reproduction and accumulation, and therefore constant reconversion of revenue into capital, while on the other hand, the mass of the producers remain tied to the average level of needs, and must remain tied to it according to the nature of capitalist production.</p>
