<p class="s33">I. Capitalism, Alienation, and Communism</p><p class="s30">Alienation of the conditions of labour with the development of capital. (Inversion). The inversion is the foundation of the capitalist mode of production, not only of its distribution.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The fact that in the development of the productive powers of labour the objective conditions of labour, objectified labour, must grow relative to living labour—this is actually a tautological statement, for what else does growing productive power of labour mean than that less immediate labour is required to create a greater product, and that therefore social wealth expresses itself more and more in the conditions of labour created by labour itself?—this fact appears from the standpoint of capital not in such a way that one of the moments of social activity—objective labour—becomes the ever more powerful body of the other moment, of subjective, living labour, but rather—and this is important for wage labour—that the objective conditions of labour assume an ever more colossal independence, represented by its very extent, opposite living labour, and that social wealth confront labour in more powerful portions as an alien and dominant power. The emphasis comes to be placed not on the state of being <span class="c1">objectified</span>, but on the state of being <span class="c1">alienated</span>, dispossessed, sold [Der Ton wird gelegt nicht auf das <span class="c1">Vergegenständlichtsein</span>, sondern das <span class="c1">Entfremdet-,</span> Entässert-, Veräussertsein]; on the condition that the monstrous objective power which social labour itself erected opposite itself as one of its moments belongs not to the worker, but to the personified conditions of production, i.e. to capital. To the extent that, from the standpoint of capital and wage labour, the creation of the objective body of activity happens in antithesis to the immediate labour capacity—that this process of objectification in fact appears as a process of dispossession from the standpoint of labour or as appropriation of alien labour from the standpoint of capital—to that extent, this twisting and inversion [<span class="c1">Verdrehung und Verkehrung</span>] is a <span class="c1">real</span> [<span class="c1">phenomenon</span>], not a merely <span class="c1">supposed one</span> existing merely in the imagination of the workers and the capitalists. But obviously this process of inversion is a merely <span class="c1">historical</span> necessity, a necessity for the development of the forces of production solely from a specific historic point of departure, or basis, but in no way an <span class="c1">absolute</span> necessity of production; rather, a vanishing one, and the result and the inherent purpose of this process is to suspend this basis itself, together with this form of the process. The bourgeois economists are so much cooped up within the notions belonging to a specific historic stage of social development that the necessity of the <span class="c1">objectification</span> of the powers of social labour appears to them as inseparable from the necessity of their <span class="c1">alienation</span> <span class="c1">vis-à-vi</span>s living labour. But with the suspension of the <span class="c1">immediate</span> character of living labour, as merely <span class="c1">individual</span>, or as general merely internally or merely externally, with the positing of the activity of individuals as immediately general or <span class="c1">social </span>activity, the objective moments of production are stripped of this form of alienation; they are thereby posited as property, as the organic social body within which the individuals reproduce themselves as individuals, but as social individual. The conditions which allow them to exist in this way in the reproduction of their life, in their productive life’s process, have been posited only by the historic economic process itself; both the objective and the subjective conditions, which are only the two distinct forms of the same conditions.</p><p class="s8">The worker’s propertylessness, and the ownership of living labour by objectified labour, or the appropriation of alien labour by capital—both merely expressions of the same relation from opposite poles—are fundamental conditions of the bourgeois mode of production, in no way accidents irrelevant to it. These modes of distribution are the relations of production themselves, but <span class="c1">sub specie distributionis</span>. It is therefore highly absurd when e.g. J. S. Mill says (<span class="c1">Principles of Political Economy</span>, 2nd ed., London, 1849, Vol. I, p. 240): “The laws and conditions of the production of wealth partake of the character of physical truths . . . It is not so with the distribution of wealth. That is a matter of human institutions solely.” (p. 239, 240.) The “laws and conditions” of the production of wealth and the laws of the ‘distribution of wealth’ are the same laws under different forms, and both change, undergo the same historic process; are as such only moments of a historic process.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_18">It requires no great penetration to grasp that, where e.g. free labour or wage labour arising out of the dissolution of bondage is the point of departure, there machines can only <span class="c1">arise</span> in antithesis to living labour, as property alien to it, and as power hostile to it; i.e. that they must confront it as capital. But it is just as easy to perceive that machines will not cease to be agencies of social production when they become e.g. property of the associated workers. In the first case, however, their distribution, i.e. that they <span class="c1">do not belong</span> to the worker, is just as much a condition of the mode of production founded on wage labour. In the second case the changed distribution would start from a <span class="c1">changed </span>foundation of production, a new foundation first created by the process of history.</p>
