<p class="s33">Private Property and Communism</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Re. p. XXXIX. </span>The antithesis of <span class="c1">propertylessness</span> and <span class="c1">property</span> so long as it is not comprehended as the antithesis of <span class="c1">labour</span> and <span class="c1">capital</span>, still remains an antithesis of indifference, not grasped in its <span class="c1">active connection</span>, its <span class="c1">internal</span> relation—an antithesis not yet grasped as a <span class="c1">contradiction</span>. It can find expression in this <span class="c1">first</span> form even without the advanced development of private property (as in ancient Rome, Turkey, etc.). It does not yet <span class="c1">appear</span> as having been established by private property itself. But labour, the subjective essence of private property as exclusion of property, and capital, objective labour as exclusion of labour, constitute <span class="c1">private property</span> as its developed state of contradiction—hence a dynamic relationship moving inexorably to its resolution.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Re. the same page</span>. The transcendence of self-estrangement follows the same course as self-estrangement. <span class="c1">Private property</span> is first considered only in its objective aspect—but nevertheless with labour as its essence. Its form of existence is therefore <span class="c1">capital,</span> which is to be annulled “as such” (Proudhon). Or a <span class="c1">particular form</span> of labour—labour levelled down, parcelled, and therefore unfree—is conceived as the source of private property’s p<span class="c1">erniciousness</span> and of its existence in estrangement from men; for instance, <span class="c1">Fourier</span>, who, like the physiocrats, also conceived <span class="c1">agricultural labour</span> to be at least the <span class="c1">exemplary</span> type, whilst <span class="c1">Saint-Simon</span> declares in contrast that <span class="c1">industrial labour</span> as such is the <span class="c1">essence</span>, and now also aspires to the <span class="c1">exclusive</span> rule of the industrialists and the improvement of the workers’ condition. Finally, <span class="c1">communism</span> is the <span class="c1">positive</span> expression of annulled private property—at first as <span class="c1">universal </span>private property. By embracing this relation as a <span class="c1">whole</span>, communism is:</p><p class="s8">(1) In its first form only a <span class="c1">generalization</span> and <span class="c1">consummation</span> of this relationship. It shows itself as such in a twofold form: on the one hand, the dominion of <span class="c1">material</span> property bulks so large that it wants to destroy everything which is not capable of being possessed by all as <span class="c1">private</span> <span class="c1">property</span>. It wants to abstract <span class="c1">by force</span> from talent, etc. For it the sole purpose of life and existence is direct, physical <span class="c1">possession</span>. The category of <span class="c1">labourer</span> is not done away with, but extended to all men. The relationship of private property persists as the relationship of the community to the world of things. Finally, this movement of counterposing universal private property to private property finds expression in the bestial form of counterposing to <span class="c1">marriage</span> (certainly a form of <span class="c1">exclusive private property</span>) the <span class="c1">community of women</span>, in which a woman becomes a piece of <span class="c1">communal</span> and <span class="c1">common</span> property. It may be said that this idea of the <span class="c1">community of women</span> gives away the <span class="c1">secret</span> of this as yet completely crude and thoughtless communism. Just as the woman passes from marriage to general prostitution,<a id="footnote-ref115" href="part0057.html#footnote115" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">115</sup></span></a> so the entire world of wealth (that is, of man’s objective substance) passes from the relationship of exclusive marriage with the owner of private property to a state of universal prostitution with the community. In negating the <span class="c1">personality </span>of man in every sphere, this type of communism is really nothing but the logical expression of private property, which is this negation. General <span class="c1">envy</span> constituting itself as a power is the disguise in which <span class="c1">avarice</span> re-establishes itself and satisfies itself, only in <span class="c1">another</span> way. The thoughts of every piece of private property—inherent in each piece as such—are at <span class="c1">least</span> turned against all <span class="c1">wealthier</span> private property in the form of envy and the urge to reduce to a common level, so that this envy and urge even constitute the essence of competition. The crude communism is only the consummation of this envy and of this leveling-down proceeding from the <span class="c1">preconceived</span> minimum. It has a <span class="c1">definite, limited</span> standard. How little this annulment of private property is really an appropriation is in fact proved by the abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilization, the regression to the <span class="c1">unnatural</span> simplicity of <span class="c1">the poor and undemanding</span> man who has not only failed to go beyond private property, but has not yet even attained to it.</p><p class="s8">The community is only a community of <span class="c1">labour,</span> and an equality of <span class="c1">wages</span> paid out by the communal capital—the <span class="c1">community</span> as the universal capitalist. Both sides of the relationship are raised to an <span class="c1">imagined</span> universality—<span class="c1">labour </span>as a state in which every person is put, and <span class="c1">capital</span> as the acknowledged universality and power of the community.</p><p class="s8">In the approach to <span class="c1">woman</span> as the spoil and handmaid of communal lust is expressed the infinite degradation in which man exists for himself, for the secret of this approach has its <span class="c1">unambiguous</span>, decisive, <span class="c1">plain</span> and undisguised expression in the relation of <span class="c1">man</span> to <span class="c1">woman</span> and in the manner in which the <span class="c1">direct</span> and <span class="c1">natural</span> procreative relationship is conceived. The direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person is the <span class="c1">relation of man to woman</span>. In this <span class="c1">natural</span> relationship of the sexes man’s relation to nature is immediately his relation to man, just as his relation to man is immediately his relation to nature—his own <span class="c1">natural</span> function. In this relationship, therefore, is <span class="c1">sensuously manifested</span>, reduced to an observable <span class="c1">fact</span>, the extent to which the human essence has become nature to man, or to which nature has to him become the human essence of man. From this relationship one can therefore judge man’s whole level of development. It follows from the character of this relationship how much <span class="c1">man</span> as a <span class="c1">species being</span>, as <span class="c1">man</span>, has come to be himself and to comprehend himself; the relation of man to woman is the <span class="c1">most natural</span> relation of human being to human being. It therefore reveals the extent to which man’s natural behaviour has become <span class="c1">human</span>, or the extent to which the <span class="c1">human</span> essence in him has become a <span class="c1">natural</span> essence—the extent to which his <span class="c1">human nature</span> has come to be nature to him. In this relationship is revealed, too, the extent to which man’s <span class="c1">need</span> has become a <span class="c1">human</span> need; the extent to which, therefore, the <span class="c1">other</span> person as person has become for him a need—the extent to which he in his individual existence is at the same time a social being. The first positive annulment of private property—<span class="c1">crude</span> communism—is thus merely one <span class="c1">form</span> in which the vileness of private property, which wants to set itself up as the <span class="c1">positive community, comes to the surface</span>.</p><p class="s8">(2) Communism (a) of a political nature still—democratic or despotic; (b) with the annulment of the state, yet still incomplete, and being still affected by private property (i.e., by the estrangement of man). In both forms communism already knows itself to be re-integration or return of man to himself, the transcendence of human self-estrangement; but since it has not yet grasped the positive essence of private property, and just as little the <span class="c1">human</span> nature of need, it remains captive to it and infected by it. It has, indeed, grasped its concept, but not its essence.</p><p class="s8">(3) <span class="c1">Communism</span> as the <span class="c1">positive</span> transcendence of <span class="c1">private property</span>, or <span class="c1">human self-estrangement</span>, and therefore as the real <span class="c1">appropriation of the human</span> essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a <span class="c1">social</span> (i.e., human) being—a return become conscious, and accomplished within the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully-developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully-developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the <span class="c1">genuine</span> resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man—the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.</p><p class="s8">The entire movement of history is, therefore, both its <span class="c1">actual</span> act of genesis (the birth act of its empirical existence) and also for its thinking consciousness the <span class="c1">comprehended</span> and <span class="c1">known </span>process of its <span class="c1">coming-to-be</span>. That other, still immature communism, meanwhile, seeks an <span class="c1">historical</span> proof for itself—a proof in the realm of the existent—amongst disconnected historical phenomena opposed to private property, tearing single phases from the historical process and focussing attention on them as proofs of its historical pedigree (a horse ridden hard especially by Cabet, Villegardelle, etc.). By so doing it simply makes clear that by far the greater part of this process contradicts its claims, and that, if it has once been, precisely its being in the <span class="c1">past</span> refutes its pretension to being <span class="c1">essential</span>.</p><p class="s8">That the entire revolutionary movement necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of <span class="c1">private property</span>—in that of the economy, to be precise—is easy to see.</p><p class="s8">This <span class="c1">material</span>, immediately <span class="c1">sensuous</span> private property is the material sensuous expression of <span class="c1">estranged human </span>life. Its movement—production and consumption—is the <span class="c1">sensuous</span> revelation of the movement of all production hitherto—i.e., the realization or the reality of man. Religion, family, state, law, morality, science, art, etc., are only <span class="c1">particular</span> modes of production, and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of <span class="c1">private property</span> as the appropriation of <span class="c1">human</span> life is, therefore, the positive transcendence of all estrangement—that is to say, the return of man from religion, family, state, etc., to his <span class="c1">human,</span> i.e., <span class="c1">social</span> mode of existence. Religious estrangement as such occurs only in the realm of consciousness, of man’s inner life, but economic estrangement is that of <span class="c1">real life;</span> its transcendence therefore embraces both aspects. It is evident that the <span class="c1">initial</span> stage of the movement amongst the various peoples depends on whether the true and for <span class="c1">them authentic</span> life of the people manifests itself more in consciousness or in the external world—is more ideal or real. Communism begins from the outset (<span class="c1">Owen</span>) with atheism; but atheism is at first far from being <span class="c1">communism;</span> indeed it is still mostly an abstraction.</p><p class="s8">The philanthropy of atheism is therefore at first only <span class="c1">philosophical,</span> abstract, philanthropy, and that of communism is at once <span class="c1">real</span> and directly bent on <span class="c1">action</span>. </p><p class="s8">We have seen how on the premise of positively annulled private property man produces man—himself and the other man; how the object, being the direct embodiment of his individuality, is simultaneously his own existence for the other man, the existence of the other man, and that existence for him. Likewise, however, both the material of labour and man as the subject, are the point of departure as well as the result of the movement (and precisely in this fact, that they must constitute the <span class="c1">point of departure</span>, lies the historical <span class="c1">necessity</span> of private property). Thus the <span class="c1">social</span> character is the general character of the whole movement: <span class="c1">just</span> as society itself produces <span class="c1">man as man</span>, so is society <span class="c1">produced</span> by him. Activity and consumption, both in their content and in their <span class="c1">mode of existence</span>, are <span class="c1">social: social</span> activity and <span class="c1">social</span> consumption; the <span class="c1">human</span> essence of nature first exists only for <span class="c1">social</span> man; for only here does nature exist for him as a <span class="c1">bond</span> with <span class="c1">man</span>—as his existence for the other and the other’s existence for him—as the life-element of the human world, only here does nature exist as the <span class="c1">foundation</span> of his own <span class="c1">human</span> existence. Only here has what is to him his <span class="c1">natural</span> existence become his <span class="c1">human</span> existence, and nature become man for him. Thus <span class="c1">society </span>is the consummated oneness in substance of man and nature—the true resurrection of nature—the naturalism of man and the humanism of nature both brought to fulfilment.</p><p class="s8">Social activity and social consumption exist by no means <span class="c1">only</span> in the form of some <span class="c1">directly</span> communal activity and directly <span class="c1">communal </span>consumption, although <span class="c1">communal</span> activity and <span class="c1">communal </span>consumption—i.e., activity and consumption which are manifested and directly confirmed in <span class="c1">real association</span> with other men—will occur wherever such a <span class="c1">direct </span>expression of sociality stems from the true character of the activity’s content and is adequate to the nature of consumption.</p><p class="s8">But again when I am active <span class="c1">scientifically</span>, etc.,—when I am engaged in activity which I can seldom perform in direct community with others—then I am <span class="c1">social</span>, because I am active as a <span class="c1">man</span>. Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as is even the language in which the thinker is active): my <span class="c1">own</span> existence <span class="c1">is</span> social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being.</p><p class="s8">My <span class="c1">general</span> consciousness is only the <span class="c1">theoretical</span> shape of that of which the<span class="c1"> living</span> shape is the <span class="c1">real</span> community, the social fabric, although at the present day <span class="c1">general</span> consciousness is an abstraction from real life and as such antagonistically confronts it. Consequently, too, the <span class="c1">activity</span> of my general consciousness, as an activity, is my <span class="c1">theoretical</span> existence as a social being.</p><p class="s8">What is to be avoided above all is the re-establishing of “Society” as an abstraction <span class="c1">vis-à-vis</span> the individual. The individual <span class="c1">is the social being</span>. His life, even if it may not appear in the direct form of a <span class="c1">communal</span> life carried out together with others—is therefore an expression and confirmation of <span class="c1">social life</span>. Man’s individual and species life are not <span class="c1">different</span>, however much—and this is inevitable—the mode of existence of the individual is a more <span class="c1">particular</span>, or more <span class="c1">general</span> mode of the life of the species, or the life of the species is a more <span class="c1">particular </span>or more <span class="c1">general</span> individual life.</p><p class="s8">In his <span class="c1">consciousness of species</span> man confirms his real <span class="c1">social life</span> and simply repeats his real existence in thought, just as conversely the being of the species confirms itself in species-consciousness and is for <span class="c1">itself</span> in its generality as a thinking being.</p><p class="s8">Man, much as he may therefore be a <span class="c1">particular</span> individual (and it is precisely his particularity which makes him an individual, and a real <span class="c1">individual</span> social being), is just as much the <span class="c1">totality</span>—the ideal totality—the subjective existence of thought and experienced society present for itself; just as he exists also in the real world as the awareness and the real enjoyment of social existence, and as a totality of human life-activity.</p><p class="s8">Thinking and being are thus no doubt <span class="c1">distinct</span>, but at the same time they are in unity with each other.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Death</span> seems to be a harsh victory of the species over the <span class="c1">definite</span> individual and to contradict their unity. But the determinate individual is only a <span class="c1">determinate species being</span>, and as such mortal.</p><p class="s8">(4) Just as <span class="c1">private property</span> is only the sensuous expression of the fact that man becomes objective for himself and at the same time becomes to himself a strange and inhuman object; just as it expresses the fact that the assertion of his life is the alienation of his life, that his realization is his loss of reality, is an <span class="c1">alien</span> reality: conversely, the positive transcendence of private property—i.e., the <span class="c1">sensuous</span> appropriation for and by man of the human essence and of human life, of objective man, of human, <span class="c1">achievements</span>—is not to be conceived merely in the sense of <span class="c1">direct</span>, one-sided <span class="c1">gratification</span>—merely in the sense of <span class="c1">possessing</span>, of <span class="c1">having</span>. Man appropriates his total essence in a total manner, that is to say, as a whole man. Each of his <span class="c1">human</span> relations to the world—seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking, being aware, sensing, wanting, acting, loving—in short, all the organs of his individual being, like those organs which are directly social in their form, are in their <span class="c1">objective</span> orientation or in their <span class="c1">orientation to the object</span>, the appropriation of that object, the appropriation of the <span class="c1">human</span> world; their orientation to the object is the <span class="c1">manifestation of the human world</span>;<a id="footnote-ref116" href="part0057.html#footnote116" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">116</sup></span></a> it is human <span class="c1">efficaciousness</span> and human <span class="c1">suffering</span>, for suffering, apprehended humanly, is an enjoyment of self in man.</p><p class="s8">Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only <span class="c1">ours</span> when we have it—when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc.,—in short, when it is <span class="c1">used</span> by us. Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realizations of possession as <span class="c1">means of life</span>, and the life which they serve as means is the <span class="c1">life of private property</span>—labour and conversion into capital.</p><p class="s8">In place of <span class="c1">all</span> these physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of <span class="c1">all</span> these senses—the sense of <span class="c1">having</span>. The human being had to be reduced to this absolute poverty in order that he might yield his inner wealth to the outer world. (On the category of <span class="c1">“having,”</span> see Hess in the <span class="c1">Twenty-One Sheets</span>.)</p><p class="s8">The transcendence of private property is therefore the complete <span class="c1">emancipation</span> of all human senses and attributes; but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become, subjectively and objectively, <span class="c1">human</span>. The eye has become a <span class="c1">human</span> eye, just as its <span class="c1">object</span> has become a social, <span class="c1">human</span> object—an object emanating from man for man. The <span class="c1">senses</span> have therefore become directly in their practice <span class="c1">theoreticians</span>. They relate themselves to the <span class="c1">thing</span> for the sake of the thing, but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man<a id="footnote-ref117" href="part0057.html#footnote117" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">117</sup></span></a>, and vice versa. Need or enjoyment have consequently lost their <span class="c1">egotistical</span> nature, and nature has lost its mere <span class="c1">utility</span> by use becoming <span class="c1">human</span> use.</p><p class="s8">In the same way, the senses and enjoyments of other men have become my <span class="c1">own</span> appropriation. Besides these direct organs, therefore, <span class="c1">social</span> organs develop in the <span class="c1">form</span> of society; thus, for instance, activity in direct association with others, etc. has become an organ for <span class="c1">expressing</span> my own <span class="c1">life</span>, and a mode of appropriating <span class="c1">human life.</span></p><p class="s8">It is obvious that the <span class="c1">human</span> eye gratifies itself in a way different from the crude, non-human eye; the human <span class="c1">ear</span> different from the crude ear, etc.</p><p class="s8">To recapitulate, man is not lost in his object only when the object becomes for him a <span class="c1">human</span> object or objective man. This is possible only when the object becomes for him a <span class="c1">social</span> object, he himself for himself a social being, just as society becomes a being for him in this object.</p><p class="s8">On the one hand, therefore, it is only when the objective world becomes everywhere for man in society the world of man’s essential powers<a id="footnote-ref118" href="part0057.html#footnote118" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">118</sup></span></a>—human reality, and for that reason the reality of his <span class="c1">own</span> essential powers—that all <span class="c1">objects</span> become for him the <span class="c1">objectification of himself</span>, become objects which confirm and realize his individuality, become <span class="c1">his</span> objects: that is, <span class="c1">man himself</span> becomes the object. The manner in which they become <span class="c1">his</span> depends on the <span class="c1">nature of the objects</span> and on the nature of the <span class="c1">essential power</span> corresponding <span class="c1">to it;</span> for it is precisely the <span class="c1">determinateness </span>of this relationship which shapes the particular, <span class="c1">real</span> mode of affirmation. To the <span class="c1">eye</span> an object comes to be other than it is to the <span class="c1">ear</span>, and the object of the eye is another object than the object of the <span class="c1">ear</span>. The peculiarity of each essential power is precisely its <span class="c1">peculiar essence</span>, and therefore also the peculiar mode of its objectification, of its <span class="c1">objectively actual</span> living <span class="c1">being</span>. Thus man is affirmed in the objective world not only in the act of thinking, but with <span class="c1">all </span>his senses.</p><p class="s8">On the other hand, looking at this in its subjective aspect: just as music alone awakens in man the sense of music, and just as the most beautiful music has <span class="c1">no</span> sense for the unmusical ear—is no object for it, because my object can only be the confirmation of one of my essential powers and can therefore only be so for me as my essential power is present for itself as a subjective capacity, because the sense of an object for me goes only so far as <span class="c1">my</span> senses go (has only sense for a sense corresponding to that object)—for this reason the <span class="c1">senses</span> of the social man are <span class="c1">other</span> senses than those of the non-social man. Only through the objectively unfolded richness of man’s essential being is the richness of subjective <span class="c1">human</span> sensibility (a musical ear, an eye for beauty of form—in short, senses capable of human gratifications, senses confirming themselves as essential powers of <span class="c1">man</span>) either cultivated or brought into being. For not only the five senses but also the so-called mental senses—the practical senses (will, love, etc.)—in a word, <span class="c1">human</span> sense—the humanness of the senses—comes to be by virtue of its object, by virtue of <span class="c1">humanized</span> nature. The <span class="c1">forming</span> of the five senses is a labour of the entire history of the world down to the present.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">sense</span> caught up in crude practical need has only a <span class="c1">restricted</span> sense. For the starving man, it is not the human form of food that exists, but only its abstract being as food; it could just as well be there in its crudest form, and it would be impossible to say wherein this feeding-activity differs from that of <span class="c1">animals</span>. The care-burdened man in need has no sense for the finest play; the dealer in minerals sees only the mercantile value but not the beauty and the unique nature of the mineral: he has no mineralogical sense. Thus, the objectification of the human essence both in its theoretical and practical aspects is required to make man’s <span class="c1">sense human</span>, as well as to create the <span class="c1">human sense</span> corresponding to the entire wealth of human and natural substance.</p><p class="s8">Just as resulting from the movement of <span class="c1">private property</span>, of its wealth as well as its poverty—or of its material and spiritual wealth and poverty—the budding society finds to hand all the material for this <span class="c1">development:</span> so <span class="c1">established</span> society produces man in this entire richness of his being—produces the <span class="c1">rich</span> man <span class="c1">profoundly endowed with all the senses</span>—as its enduring reality.</p><p class="s8">It will be seen how subjectivism and objectivism, spiritualism and materialism, activity and suffering, only lose their antithetical character, and thus their existence, as such antitheses in the social condition; it will be seen how the resolution of the <span class="c1">theoretical</span> antitheses is <span class="c1">only</span> possible in a <span class="c1">practical</span> way, by virtue of the practical energy of men. Their resolution is therefore by no means merely a problem of knowledge, but a <span class="c1">real </span>problem of life, which <span class="c1">philosophy</span> could not solve precisely because it conceived this problem as <span class="c1">merely</span> a theoretical one.</p><p class="s8">It will be seen how the history of <span class="c1">industry</span> and the established <span class="c1">objective</span> existence of industry are the <span class="c1">open</span> book of <span class="c1">man’s essential powers</span>, the exposure to the senses of human <span class="c1">psychology</span>. Hitherto this was not conceived in its inseparable connection with man’s <span class="c1">essential being</span>, but only in an external relation of utility, because, moving in the realm of estrangement, people could only think man’s general mode of being—religion or history in its abstract general character as politics, art, literature, etc.,—to be the reality of man’s essential powers and <span class="c1">man’s species-activity</span>. We have before us the <span class="c1">objectified essential powers</span> of man in the form of <span class="c1">sensuous, alien, useful objects</span>, in the form of estrangement, displayed in <span class="c1">ordinary material industry</span> (which can be conceived as a part of that general movement, just as that movement can be conceived as a particular part of industry, since all human activity hitherto has been labour—that is, industry—activity estranged from itself). </p><p class="s8">A <span class="c1">psychology</span> for which this, the part of history most contemporary and accessible to sense, remains a closed book, cannot become a genuine, comprehensive and <span class="c1">real </span>science. What indeed are we to think of a science which <span class="c1">airily</span> abstracts from this large part of human labour and which fails to feel its own incompleteness, while such a wealth of human endeavour unfolded before it means nothing more to it than, perhaps, what can be expressed in one word—<span class="c1">“need,” “vulgar need”?</span></p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">natural sciences</span> have developed an enormous activity and have accumulated a constantly growing mass of material. Philosophy, however, has remained just as alien to them as they remain to philosophy. Their momentary unity was only a <span class="c1">chimerical illusion</span>. The will was there, but the means were lacking. Even historiography pays regard to natural science only occasionally, as a factor of enlightenment and utility arising from individual great discoveries. But natural science has invaded and transformed human life all the more <span class="c1">practically</span> through the medium of industry; and has prepared human emancipation, however directly and much it had to consummate dehumanization. <span class="c1">Industry</span> is the <span class="c1">actual</span>, historical relation of nature, and therefore of natural science, to man. If, therefore, industry is conceived as the <span class="c1">exoteric</span> revelation of man’s <span class="c1">essential powers</span>, we also gain an understanding of the <span class="c1">human</span> essence of nature or the <span class="c1">natural</span> essence of man. In consequence, natural science will lose to abstractly material—or rather, its idealistic—tendency, and will become the basis of <span class="c1">human</span> science, as it has already become the basis of actual human life, albeit in an estranged form. <span class="c1">One</span> basis for life and another basis for <span class="c1">science</span> is <span class="c1">a priori</span> a lie. The nature which comes to be in human history—the genesis of human society—is man’s <span class="c1">real</span> nature; hence nature as it comes to be through industry, even though in an <span class="c1">estranged</span> form, is true <span class="c1">anthropological</span> nature.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Sense-perception</span> (see Feuerbach) must be the basis of all science. Only when it proceeds from sense-perception in the twofold form both of <span class="c1">sensuous</span> consciousness and of <span class="c1">sensuous </span>need—that is, only when science proceeds from nature—is it <span class="c1">true</span> science. All history is the preparation for <span class="c1">“man”</span> to become the object of <span class="c1">sensuous</span> consciousness, and for the needs of “man as man” to become [natural, sensuous] needs. History itself is a <span class="c1">real</span> part of <span class="c1">natural history</span>—of nature’s coming to be man. Natural science will in time subsume under itself the science of man, just as the science of man will subsume under itself natural science: there will be <span class="c1">one</span> science. </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Man</span> is the immediate object of natural science: for immediate, <span class="c1">sensuous nature</span> for man is, immediately, human sensuousness (the expressions are identical)—presented immediately in the form of the <span class="c1">other</span> man sensuously present for him. For his own sensuousness first exists as human sensuousness for himself through the <span class="c1">other</span> man. But <span class="c1">nature</span> is the immediate object of the <span class="c1">science of man:</span> the first object of man—man—is nature, sensuousness; and the particular human sensuous essential powers can only find their self-knowledge in the science of the natural world in general, since they can find their objective realization in <span class="c1">natural </span>objects only. The element of thought itself—the element of thought’s living expression—<span class="c1">language</span>—is of a sensuous nature. The <span class="c1">social</span> reality of nature, and <span class="c1">human</span> natural science, or the <span class="c1">natural science about man</span>, are identical terms. </p><p class="s8">It will be seen how in place of the <span class="c1">wealth</span> and <span class="c1">poverty</span> of political economy come the <span class="c1">rich human being</span> and rich <span class="c1">human</span> need. The <span class="c1">rich</span> human being is simultaneously the human being in need of a totality of human life-activities—the man in whom his own realization exists as an inner necessity, as <span class="c1">need</span>. Not only <span class="c1">wealth</span>, but likewise the <span class="c1">poverty</span> of man—given socialism—receives in equal measure a <span class="c1">human</span> and therefore social significance. Poverty is the passive bond which causes the human being to experience the need of the greatest wealth—the <span class="c1">other</span> human being. The dominion of the objective being in me, the sensuous outburst of my essential activity, is <span class="c1">emotion</span>, which thus becomes here the <span class="c1">activity</span> of my being.</p><p class="s8">(5) A <span class="c1">being</span> only considers himself independent when he stands on his own feet; and he only stands on his own feet when he owes his <span class="c1">existence</span> to himself. A man who lives by the grace of another regards himself as a dependent being. But I live completely by the grace of another if I owe him not only the sustenance of my life, but if he has, moreover, <span class="c1">created</span> my <span class="c1">life</span>—if he is the <span class="c1">source</span> of my life; and if it is not of my own creation, my life has necessarily a source of this kind outside it. The <span class="c1">Creation</span> is therefore an idea very difficult to dislodge from popular consciousness. The self-mediated being of nature and of man is <span class="c1">incomprehensible</span> to it, because it contradicts everything <span class="c1">palpable </span>in practical life.</p><p class="s8">The creation of the <span class="c1">earth</span> has received a mighty blow from <span class="c1">geogeny</span>—i.e., from the science which presents the formation of the earth, the coming-to-be of the earth, as a process, as self-generation. <span class="c1">Generatio aequivoca</span><a id="footnote-ref119" href="part0057.html#footnote119" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">119</sup></span></a> is the only practical refutation of the theory of creation. </p><p class="s8">Now it is certainly easy to say to the single individual what Aristotle has already said. You have been begotten by your father and your mother; therefore in you the mating of two human beings—a species-act of human beings—has produced the human being. You see, therefore, that even physically, man owes his existence to man. Therefore you must not only keep sight of the <span class="c1">one</span> aspect—the <span class="c1">infinite</span> progression which lead you further to enquire: “Who begot my father? Who his grandfather?”, etc. You must also hold on to the <span class="c1">circular movement</span> sensuously perceptible in that progression, by which man repeats himself in procreation, thus always remaining the subject. You will reply, however: I grant you this circular movement; now grant me the progression which drives me even further until I ask: Who begot the first man, and nature as a whole? I can only answer you: Your question is itself a product of abstraction. Ask yourself how you arrived at that question. Ask yourself whether your question is not posed from a standpoint to which I cannot reply, because it is a perverse one. Ask yourself whether that progression as such exists for a reasonable mind. When you ask about the creation of nature and man, you are abstracting, in so doing, from man and nature. You postulate them as <span class="c1">non-existent</span>, and yet you want me to prove them to you as <span class="c1">existing</span>. Now I say to you: Give up your abstraction and you will also give up your question. Or if you want to hold on to your abstraction, then be consistent, and if you think of man and nature as <span class="c1">non-existent</span>, then think of yourself as non-existent, for you too are surely nature and man. Don’t think, don’t ask me, for as soon as you think and ask, your <span class="c1">abstraction</span> from the existence of nature and man has no meaning. Or are you such an egoist that you postulate everything as nothing, and yet want yourself to be?</p><p class="s8">You can reply: I do not want to postulate the nothingness of nature. I ask you about <span class="c1">its genesis</span>, just as I ask the anatomist about the formation of bones, etc.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_6">But since for the socialist man the <span class="c1">entire so-called history of the world</span> is nothing but the begetting of man through human labour, nothing but the coming-to-be of nature for man, he has the visible, irrefutable proof of his <span class="c1">birth</span> through himself, of his <span class="c1">process</span> of <span class="c1">coming-to-be</span>. Since the <span class="c1">real existence</span> of man and nature has become practical, sensuous and perceptible—since man has become for man as the being of nature, and nature for man as the being of man—the question about an <span class="c1">alien</span> being, about a being above nature and man—a question which implies the admission of the inessentiality of nature and of man—has become impossible in practice. <span class="c1">Atheism</span>, as the denial of this inessentiality, has no longer any meaning, for atheism is a <span class="c1">negation of God</span>, and postulates the <span class="c1">existence of man</span> through this negation; but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation. It proceeds from the <span class="c1">practically and theoretically sensuous consciousness</span> of man and of nature as the <span class="c1">essence</span>. Socialism is man’s <span class="c1">positive self-consciousness</span> no longer mediated through the annulment of religion, just as <span class="c1">real life</span> is man’s positive reality, no longer mediated through the annulment of private property, through <span class="c1">communism</span>. Communism is the position as the negation of the negation, and is hence the <span class="c1">actual</span> phase necessary for the next stage of historical development in the process of human emancipation and recovery. <span class="c1">Communism</span> is the necessary pattern and the dynamic principle of the immediate future, but communism as such is not the goal of human development—the structure of human society.</p>
