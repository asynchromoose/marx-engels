<p class="s33">E. Pre-Capitalist Property and Production</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The original unity between a particular form of community (clan) and the corresponding property in nature, or relation to the objective conditions of production as a natural being, as an objective being of the individual mediated by the commune—this unity, which appears in one respect as the particular form of property—has its living reality in a specific <span class="c1">mode of production</span> itself, a mode which appears both as a relation between the individuals, and as their specific active relation to inorganic nature, a specific mode of working (which is always family labour, often communal labour). The community itself appears as the first great force of production; particular kinds of production conditions (e.g. stock-breeding, agriculture), develop particular modes of production and particular forces of production, subjective, appearing as qualities of individuals, as well as objective [ones].</p><p class="s8"> In the last analysis, their community, as well as the property based on it, resolves itself into a specific stage in the development of the productive forces of working subjects—to which correspond their specific relations amongst one another and towards nature. Until a certain point, reproduction. Then turns into dissolution.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Property</span>, then, originally means—in its Asiatic, Slavonic, ancient classical, Germanic form—the relation of the working (producing or self-reproducing) subject to the conditions of his production or reproduction as his own. It will therefore have different forms depending on the conditions of this production. Production itself aims at the reproduction of the producer within and together with these, his objective conditions of existence. This relation as proprietor—not as a result but as a presupposition of labour, i.e. of production—presupposes the individual defined as a member of a clan or community (whose property the individual himself is, up to a certain point). Slavery, bondage etc., where the worker himself appears among the natural conditions of production for a third individual or community (this is <span class="c1">not</span> the case e.g. with the general slavery of the Orient, <span class="c1">only</span> from the European point of view)—i.e. property no longer the relation of the working individual to the objective conditions of labour—is always secondary, derived, never original, although [it is] a necessary and logical result of property founded on the community and labour in the community. It is of course very simple to imagine that some powerful, physically dominant individual, after first having caught the animal, then catches humans in order to have them catch animals; in a word, uses human beings as another naturally occurring condition for his reproduction (whereby his own labour reduces itself to ruling) like any other natural creature. But such a notion is stupid—correct as it may be from the standpoint of some particular given clan or commune—because it proceeds from the development of<span class="c1"> isolated individuals</span>. But human beings become individuals only through the process of history. He appears originally as a <span class="c1">species-being</span> [<span class="c1">Gattungswesen</span>], <span class="c1">clan being, herd animal</span>—although in no way whatever as a ζωον πολιτικον<a id="footnote-ref232" href="part0057.html#footnote232" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">232</sup></span></a> in the political sense. Exchange itself is a chief means of this individuation [<span class="c1">Vereinzelung</span>]. It makes the herd-like existence superfluous and dissolves it. Soon the matter [has] turned in such a way that as an individual he relates himself only to himself, while the means with which he posits himself as individuals have become the making of his generality and commonness. In this community, the objective being of the individual as proprietor, say proprietor of land, is presupposed, and presupposed moreover under certain conditions which chain him to the community, or rather form a link in his chain. In bourgeois society, the worker e.g. stands there purely without objectivity, subjectively; but the thing which <span class="c1">stands opposite</span> him has now become the <span class="c1">true community</span> [<span class="c1">Gemeinwesen</span>], which he tries to make a meal of, and which makes a meal of him.</p><p class="s8">All forms (more or less naturally arisen, spontaneous, all at the same time however results of a historic process) in which the community presupposes its subjects in a specific objective unity with their conditions of production, or in which a specific subjective mode of being presupposes the communities themselves as conditions of production, necessarily correspond to a development of the forces of production which is only limited, and indeed limited in principle. The development of the forces of production dissolves these forms, and their dissolution is itself a development of the human productive forces. Labour begins with a certain foundation—naturally arisen, spontaneous, at first—then historic presupposition. Then, however, this foundation or presupposition is itself suspended, or posited as a vanishing presupposition which has become too confining for the unfolding of the progressing human pack.</p><p class="s8">In so far as classical landed property reappears in modern small parcel landownership, it itself belongs to political economy and we shall come to it in the section on landed property.</p><p class="s8">(All this is to be returned to at greater depth and length.)</p><p class="s8">What we are here concerned with is this: the relation of labour to capital, or to the objective conditions of labour as capital, presupposes a process of history which dissolves the various forms in which the worker is a proprietor, or in which the proprietor works. Thus above all (1) <span class="c1">Dissolution</span> of the relation to the earth—land and soil—as natural condition of production—to which he relates as to his own inorganic being; the workshop of his forces, and the domain of his will. All forms in which this property appears presuppose a <span class="c1">community</span>, whose members, although there may be formal distinctions between them, are, as members of it, <span class="c1">proprietors</span>. The original form of this property is therefore itself <span class="c1">direct common property</span> (<span class="c1">oriental form</span>, modified in the Slavonic; developed to the point of antithesis, but still as the secret, if antithetical, foundation in classical and Germanic property). (2) <span class="c1">Dissolution of the relations</span> in which he appears as <span class="c1">proprietor of the instrument</span>. Just as the above form of landed property presupposes a <span class="c1">real community</span>, so does this property of the worker in the instrument presuppose a particular form of the development of manufactures, namely <span class="c1">craft, artisan work;</span> bound up with it, the guild, corporation system etc. (The manufacture system of the ancient Orient can be examined under (1) already.) Here labour itself still half artistic, half end-in-itself etc. Mastery. Capitalist himself still master-journeyman. Attainment of particular skill in the work also secures possession of instrument etc. etc. Inheritability then to a certain extent of the mode of work together with the organization of work and the instrument of work. Medieval cities. Labour still as his own; definite self-sufficient development of one-sided abilities etc. (3) Included in both is the fact that he has the means of consumption in his possession before production, which are necessary for him to live as producer—i.e. during production, <span class="c1">before</span> its completion. As proprietor of land he appears as directly provided with the necessary consumption fund. As master in a craft he has inherited it, earned it, saved it up, and as a young he is first an <span class="c1">apprentice</span>, where he does not appear as an actual independent worker at all, but shares the master’s fare in a patriarchal way. As journeyman (a genuine one) there is a certain communality in the consumption fund possessed by the master. While it is not the journeyman’s <span class="c1">property</span> either, still, through the laws of the guild, tradition etc., at least co-possession etc. (To be gone into further.) (4) <span class="c1">Dissolution </span>likewise at the same time of the relations in which the <span class="c1">workers themselves,</span> the <span class="c1">living labour capacities</span> themselves, still belong <span class="c1">directly among the objective conditions of production</span>, and are appropriated as such—i.e. are slaves or serfs. For capital, the worker is not a condition of production, only work is. If it can make machines do it, or even water, air, so much the better. And it does not appropriate the worker, but his labour—not directly, but mediated through exchange.</p><p class="s8">These are, now, on one side, historic presuppositions needed before the worker can be found as a free worker, as objectless, purely subjective labour capacity confronting the objective conditions of production as his <span class="c1">not property,</span> as <span class="c1">alien property</span>, as <span class="c1">value</span> for-itself, as capital. But the question arises, on the other side, which conditions are required so that he finds himself up against a <span class="c1">capital?</span></p><p class="s8">&lt;The formula of capital, where living labour relates to the raw material as well as to the instrument and to the means of subsistence required during labour, as negatives, as not-property, <span class="c1">includes</span>, first of all, <span class="c1">not-land-ownership</span>, or, the negation of the situation in which the working individual relates to land and soil, to the earth, as his own, i.e. in which he works, produces, as proprietor of the land and soil. In the best case he relates not only as worker to the land and soil, but also as proprietor of the land and soil to himself as working subject. Ownership of land and soil potentially also includes ownership of the raw material, as well as of the primordial instrument, the earth itself, and of its spontaneous fruits. Posited in the most original form, it means relating to the earth as proprietor, and finding raw material and instrument on hand, as well as the necessaries of life created not by labour but by the earth itself. Once this relation is reproduced, secondary instruments and fruits of the earth created through labour itself appear as included with landed property in its primitive forms. This historic situation is thus first of all negated as a full property relation, in the worker’s relation to the conditions of labour as capital. This is historic state No. I, which is negated in this relation or presupposed as historically dissolved. Secondly, however, where there is <span class="c1">ownership of the instrument</span> on the part of the worker, i.e. the worker relates to the instrument as his own, where the worker works as owner of the instrument (which at the same time presupposes the subsumption of the instrument under his individual work, i.e. a particular, limited developmental stage of the productive force of labour), where this form of the <span class="c1">worker as owner</span> or of the <span class="c1">working owner</span> is already posited as an independent form beside and apart from <span class="c1">landed property</span>—the artisan-like and urban development of labour—not, as in the first case, as accidental to landed property and subsumed under it—hence where the raw material and the necessaries of life are also <span class="c1">mediated</span> as the craftsman’s property, mediated through his craft work, through his property in the instrument—there a second historical stage is already presupposed beside and apart from the first, which must itself already appear significantly modified, through the<span class="c1"> achievement of independence by this second sort of property</span> or <span class="c1">by working owners</span>. Since the instrument itself is already the product of labour, thus the element which constitutes property already exists as posited by labour, the community can no longer appear here in a naturally arisen, spontaneous form as in the first case—the community on which this form of property founded—but rather as itself already a produced, made, derived and secondary community, produced by the worker himself. It is clear that wherever ownership of the instrument is the relation to the conditions of production as property, there, in the real labour process, the instrument appears <span class="c1">only as a means</span> of individual labour; the art of really appropriating the instrument, of handling it as an instrument of labour, appears as the worker’s particular skill, which posits him as the owner of the instrument. In short, the essential character of the guild-corporation system, of craft work as its subject, constituted by owners—can be resolved into the relation to the instrument of production—the instrument of labour as property—as distinct from the relation to the earth, to land and soil (to the raw material as such) as one’s own. That the relation to this one moment of the conditions of production constitutes the working subject as owner, makes him into a working owner, this [is] historic situation No. II, which by its nature can exist only as antithesis to or, if one will, at the same time as complement of a modified form of the first—likewise negated in the first formula of capital. The third <span class="c1">possible form</span>, in which the worker relates as owner only to the necessaries of life, finding them on hand as the natural condition of the working subject, without relating to the land and soil, or to the instrument, or even (therefore) to labour itself as his own, is at bottom the formula of slavery and bondage, which is likewise negated, posited as a historically dissolved condition, in the relation of the worker to the conditions of production as capital. The original forms of property necessarily dissolve into the relation to the different objective moments which condition production, as one’s own; they form the economic foundation of different forms of community, just as they for their part have specific forms of the community as presupposition. These forms are essentially modified by the inclusion of labour itself among the <span class="c1">objective conditions of production</span> (serfdom and slavery), through which the simply affirmative character of all forms of property included under No. 1 is lost and modified. They all contain, within themselves, slavery as possibility and hence as their own suspension. As regards No. II, where the particular kind of work—mastery of it, and, consequent upon that, an identity between property in the instrument and property in the conditions of production—while it excludes slavery and bondage, can take on an analogous negative development in the form of the caste system.&gt; &lt;The third form, ownership of the necessaries of life—if it does not reduce itself to slavery and serfdom—cannot contain a relation by the <span class="c1">working</span> individual to the conditions of production and hence of existence; it can therefore only be the relation of a member of the original community based on land ownership who has lost his landed property and not yet proceeded to variety No. II of property, such as the Roman <span class="c1">plebs</span> at the time of the bread and circuses.&gt; &lt;The relation of personal servitude, or of the retainers to their lord, is essentially different. For it forms, at bottom, only a mode of existence of the land-proprietor himself, who no longer works, but whose property includes, among the other conditions of production, the workers themselves as bondsmen etc. Here the <span class="c1">master-servant relation</span> [<span class="c1">Herrschaftsverhältnis</span>] as essential element of appropriation. Basically the appropriation of animals, land etc. cannot take place in a master-servant relation, although the animal provides service. The presupposition of the master-servant relation is the appropriation of an alien <span class="c1">will</span>. Whatever has no will, e.g. the animal, may well provide a service, but does not thereby make its owner into a <span class="c1">master</span>. This much can be seen here, however, that the <span class="c1">master-servant relation</span> likewise belongs in this formula of the appropriation of the instruments of production; and it forms a necessary ferment for the development and the decline and fall of all original relations of property and of production, just as it also expresses their limited nature. Still, it is reproduced—in mediated form—in capital, and thus likewise forms a ferment of its dissolution and is an emblem of its limitation.&gt;</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">On one side, historic processes are presupposed which place a mass of individuals in a nation etc. in the position, if not at first of real free workers, nevertheless of such who are so δυναμει, whose only property is their labour capacity and the possibility of exchanging it for values then present; individuals who confront all objective conditions of production as <span class="c1">alien property</span>, as their own <span class="c1">not-property</span>, but at the same time as <span class="c1">values</span>, as exchangeable, hence appropriable to a certain degree through living labour. Such historic processes of dissolution are also the dissolution of the bondage relations which fetter the worker to land and soil and to the lord of land and soil; but which factually presuppose his ownership of the necessaries of life—this is in truth the process of his release from the earth; dissolution of the landed property relations, which constituted him as a yeoman, as a free, working small landowner or tenant (<span class="c1">colonus</span>), a free peasant;<a id="footnote-ref233" href="part0057.html#footnote233" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">233</sup></span></a> dissolution of the guild relations which presuppose his ownership of the instrument of labour, and which presuppose labour itself as a craftsmanlike, specific skill, as property (not merely as the source of property); likewise dissolution of the client-relations in the various forms in which <span class="c1">not-proprietors</span> appear in the retinue of their lord as co-consumers of the surplus product and wear the livery of their master as an equivalent, participate in his feuds, perform personal services, imaginary or real etc. It will be seen on closer inspection that all these processes of dissolution mean the dissolution of relations of production in which: use value predominates, production for direct consumption; in which exchange value and its production presupposes the predominance of the other form; and hence that, in all these relations, payments in kind and services in kind predominate over payment in money and money-services. But this only by the way. It will likewise be found on closer observation that all the dissolved relations were possible only with a definite degree of development of the material (and hence also the intellectual) forces of production.</p><p class="s8">What concerns us here for the moment is this: the process of dissolution, which transforms a mass of individuals of a nation etc. into free wage labourers δυναμει—individuals forced solely by their lack of property to labour and to sell their labour—presupposes on the other side <span class="c1">not</span> that these individuals’ previous sources of income and in part conditions of property have <span class="c1">disappeared</span>, but the reverse, that <span class="c1">only</span> their utilization has become different, that their mode of existence has changed, has gone over into other hands as a <span class="c1">free fund</span> or has even in part remained <span class="c1">in the same</span> hands. But this much is clear: the same process which divorced a mass of individuals from their previous relations to the <span class="c1">objective conditions of labour</span>, relations which were, in one way or another, affirmative, negated these relations, and thereby transformed these individuals into <span class="c1">free workers</span>, this same process freed—δυναμει—these <span class="c1">objective conditions of labour</span>—land and soil, raw material, necessaries of life, instruments of labour, money or all of these—from their <span class="c1">previous state of attachment</span> to the individuals now separated from them. They are still <span class="c1">there on hand</span>, but in another form; as a <span class="c1">free fund,</span> in which all political etc. relations are obliterated. The objective conditions of labour now confront these unbound, propertyless individuals only in the form of <span class="c1">values</span>, self-sufficient values. The same process which placed the mass face to face with the <span class="c1">objective conditions of labour</span> as free workers also placed these conditions, as <span class="c1">capital</span>, face to face with the free workers. The historic process was the divorce of elements which up until then were bound together; its result is therefore not that one of the elements disappears, but that each of them appears in a negative relation to the other—the (potentially) free worker on the one side, capital (potentially) on the other. The separation of the objective conditions from the classes which have become transformed into free workers necessarily also appears at the same time as the achievement of independence by these same conditions at the opposite pole.</p><p class="s8">If the relation of capital and wage labour is regarded not as already commanding and predominant over the whole of production,<a id="footnote-ref234" href="part0057.html#footnote234" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">234</sup></span></a> but as arising historically—i.e. if we regard the original transformation of money into capital, the process of exchange between capital, still only existing δυναμει on one side and the free workers existing δυναμει on the other—then of course one cannot help making the simple observation, out of which the economists make a great show, that the side which appears as capital has to possess raw materials, instruments of labour and necessaries of life so that the worker can live during production, before production is completed. This further takes the form that there must have taken place on the part of the capitalist an accumulation—an accumulation prior to labour and not sprung out of it—which enables him to put the worker to work and to maintain his effectiveness, to maintain him as living labour capacity.<a id="footnote-ref235" href="part0057.html#footnote235" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">235</sup></span></a> This act by capital which is independent of labour, not posited by labour, is then shifted from the prehistory of capital into the present, into a moment of its reality and of its present activity, of its self-formation. From this is ultimately derived the eternal right of capital to the fruits of labour, or rather its mode of appropriation is developed out of the simple and ‘just’ laws of equivalent exchange.</p><p class="s8">Wealth present in the form of money can be exchanged for the objective conditions of labour only because and if these are separated from labour itself. We saw that money can be piled up in part by way of the sheer exchange of equivalents; but this forms so insignificant a source that it is not worth mentioning historically—if it is presupposed that this money is gained through the exchange of one’s own labour. The monetary wealth which becomes transformed into capital in the proper sense, into industrial capital, is rather the mobile wealth piled up through usury—especially that practised against landed property—and through mercantile profits. We shall have occasion below to speak further of both of these forms—in so far as they appear not as themselves forms of capital, but as earlier forms of wealth, as presuppositions for capital.</p><p class="s8">It is inherent in the concept of capital, as we have seen—in its origin—that it begins with <span class="c1">money</span> and hence with wealth existing in the form of money. It is likewise inherent in it that it appears as coming out of circulation, as the <span class="c1">product</span> of circulation. The formation of capital thus does not emerge from landed property (here at most from the <span class="c1">tenant</span> [<span class="c1">Pächter</span>] in so far as he is a dealer in agricultural products); or from the guild (although there is a possibility at the last point); but rather from merchant’s and usurer’s wealth. But the latter encounter the conditions where free labour can be purchased only when this labour has been released from its objective conditions of existence through the process of history. Only then does it also encounter the possibility of buying these <span class="c1">conditions</span> themselves. Under guild conditions, e.g., mere money, if it is not itself guild money, masters’ money, cannot buy the looms to make people work with them; how many an individual may operate etc. is prescribed. In short, the instrument itself is still so intertwined with living labour, whose domain it appears, that it does not truly circulate. What enables money wealth to become capital is the encounter, on one side, with free workers; and on the other side, with the necessaries and materials etc., which previously were in one way or another the <span class="c1">property</span> of the masses who have now become object-less, and are also <span class="c1">free</span> and purchasable. The other condition of labour, however—a certain level of skill, instrument as means of labour etc.—is already <span class="c1">available</span> to it in this preliminary or first period of capital, partly as a result of the urban guild system, partly as a result of domestic industry, or industry which is attached to agriculture as an accessory. This historic process is not the product of capital, but the presupposition for it. And it is through this process that the capitalist inserts himself as (historic) middle-man between landed property, or property generally, and labour. History knows nothing of the congenial fantasies according to which the capitalist and the workers form an association etc., nor is there a trace of them in the conceptual development of capital. <span class="c1">Manufactures</span> may develop sporadically, locally, in a framework which still belongs to a quite different period, as e.g. in the Italian cities <span class="c1">alongside</span> the guilds. But as the sole predominant forms of an epoch, the conditions for capital have to be developed not only locally but on a grand scale. (Notwithstanding this, individual guild masters may develop into capitalists with the dissolution of the guilds; but the case is rare, in the nature of the thing as well. As a rule, the whole guild system declines and falls, both master and journeyman, where the capitalist and the worker arise.)</p><p class="s8">It goes without saying—and shows itself if we go more deeply into the historic epoch under discussion here—that in truth the <span class="c1">period of the dissolution</span> of their earlier modes of production and modes of the worker’s relation to the objective conditions of labour is <span class="c1">at the same time a period</span> in which <span class="c1">monetary wealth</span> on the one side <span class="c1">has</span> already developed to a certain extent, and on the other side grows and expands rapidly through the same circumstances as accelerate the above dissolution. It is itself one of the agencies of that dissolution, while at the same time that dissolution is the condition of its transformation into capital. But the <span class="c1">mere presence of monetary wealth,</span> and even the achievement of a kind of supremacy on its part, is in no way sufficient for this <span class="c1">dissolution into capital</span> to happen. Or else ancient Rome, Byzantium etc. would have ended their history with free labour and capital, or rather begun a new history. There, too, the dissolution of the old property relations was bound up with development of monetary wealth—of trade etc. But instead of leading to industry, this dissolution led in fact to the supremacy of the countryside over the city.—<span class="c1">The original formation</span> of capital does not happen, as is sometimes imagined, with capital <span class="c1">heaping up</span> necessaries of life and instruments of labour and raw materials, in short, the <span class="c1">objective</span> conditions of labour which have already been unbound from the soil and animated by human labour.<a id="footnote-ref236" href="part0057.html#footnote236" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">236</sup></span></a> Capital does not create the objective conditions of labour. Rather, its <span class="c1">original formation</span> is that, through the historic process of the dissolution of the old mode of production, value existing as money-wealth is enabled, on one side, <span class="c1">to buy</span> the objective conditions of labour; on the other side, to exchange money for the <span class="c1">living labour </span>of the workers who have been set free. All these moments are present; their divorce is itself a historic process, a process of dissolution, and it is <span class="c1">the latter</span> which enables money to transform itself into <span class="c1">capital</span>. Money itself, to the extent that it also plays an active role, does so only in so far as it intervenes in this process as itself a highly energetic solvent, and to that extent assists in the creation of the <span class="c1">plucked</span> object-less free workers; but certainly not by <span class="c1">creating</span> the objective conditions of their existence, rather by helping to speed up their separation from them—their propertylessness. When e.g. the great English landowners dismissed their retainers, who had, together with them, consumed the surplus product of the land; when further their tenants chased off the smaller cottagers etc., then, firstly, a mass of living labour powers was thereby thrown onto the <span class="c1">labour market</span>, a mass which was free in a double sense, free from the old relations of clientship, bondage and servitude, and secondly free of all belongings and possessions, and of every objective, material form of being, <span class="c1">free of all property;</span> dependent on the sale of its labour capacity or on begging, vagabondage and robbery as its only source of income. It is a matter of historic record that they tried the latter first, but were driven off this road by gallows, stocks and whippings, onto the narrow path to the labour market; owing to this fact, the <span class="c1">governments</span>, e.g. of Henry VII, VIII etc. appear as conditions of the historic dissolution process and as makers of the conditions for the existence of capital. On the other side, the necessaries of life etc., which the landowners previously ate up together with their retainers, now stood at the disposal of any money which might wish to buy them in order to buy labour through their instrumentality. Money neither <span class="c1">created</span> nor <span class="c1">stockpiled</span> these necessaries; they were there and were consumed and reproduced before they were consumed and reproduced through its mediation. What had changed was simply this, that these necessaries were now thrown on to the <span class="c1">exchange market</span>—were separated from their direct connection with the mouths of the retainers etc. and transformed from use values into exchange values, and thus fell into the domain and under the supremacy of money wealth. Likewise with the instruments of labour. Money wealth neither invented nor fabricated the spinning wheel and the loom. But, once unbound from their land and soil, spinner and weaver with their stools and wheels came under the command of money wealth. <span class="c1">Capital proper does nothing but bring together the mass of hands and instruments which it finds on hand. It agglomerates them under its command.</span> That is its <span class="c1">real stockpiling;</span> the stockpiling of workers, along with their instruments, at particular points. This will have to be dealt with more closely in the so-called <span class="c1">stockpiling</span> of capital. Monetary wealth—as merchant wealth—had admittedly helped to speed up and to dissolve the old relations of production, and made it possible for the proprietor of land for example, as A. Smith already nicely develops,<a id="footnote-ref237" href="part0057.html#footnote237" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">237</sup></span></a> to exchange his grain and cattle etc. for use values brought from afar, instead of squandering the use values he himself produced, along with his retainers, and to locate his wealth in great part in the mass of his co-consuming retainers. It gave the <span class="c1">exchange value</span> of his revenue a higher significance for him. The same thing took place in regard to his tenants, who were already semi-capitalists, but still very hemmed in ones. The development of exchange value—favoured by <span class="c1">money</span> existing in the form of the merchant estate—dissolves production which is more oriented towards direct use value and its corresponding forms of property—the relations of labour to its objective conditions—and thus pushes forward towards the making of the <span class="c1">labour market</span> (certainly to be distinguished from the slave market). However, even this action of money is only possible given the presupposition of an <span class="c1">urban artisanate</span> resting <span class="c1">not</span> on capital, but on the organization of labour in guilds etc. Urban labour itself had created means of production for which the guilds became just as confining as were the old relations of landownership to an improved agriculture, which was in part itself a consequence of the larger market for agricultural products in the cities etc. The other circumstances which e.g. in the sixteenth century increased the mass of circulating commodities as well as that of money, which created new needs and thereby raised the exchange value of indigenous products etc., raised prices etc., all of these promoted on one side the dissolution of the old relations of production, sped up the separation of the worker or non-worker but able-bodied individual from the objective conditions of his reproduction, and thus promoted the transformation of money into capital. There can therefore be nothing more ridiculous than to conceive this <span class="c1">original formation</span> of capital as if capital had stockpiled and created the <span class="c1">objective conditions of production</span>—necessaries, raw materials, instrument—and then offered them to the worker, who was <span class="c1">bare</span> of these possessions. Rather, monetary wealth in part helped to <span class="c1">strip</span> the labour powers of able-bodied individuals from these conditions; and in part this process of divorce proceeded without it. When the formation of capital had reached a certain level, monetary wealth could place itself as mediator between the objective conditions of life, thus liberated, and the liberated but also <span class="c1">homeless </span>and <span class="c1">emptyhanded</span> labour powers, and buy the latter with the former. But now, as far as the <span class="c1">formation of money-wealth</span> itself is concerned, this belongs to the prehistory of the bourgeois economy. Usury, trade, urbanization and the treasury rising with it play the main roles here. So, too, <span class="c1">hoarding</span> by tenants, peasants etc.; although to a lesser degree.—This shows at the same time that the development of exchange and of exchange value, which is everywhere mediated through trade, or whose mediation may be termed trade—money achieves an independent existence in the merchant estate, as does circulation in trade—brings with it both the dissolution of <span class="c1">labour’s relations of property in its</span> conditions of existence, in one respect, and at the same time the dissolution of <span class="c1">labour</span> which is itself <span class="c1">classed as one of the objective conditions of production;</span> all these are relations which express a predominance of use value and of production directed towards use value, as well as of a real community which is itself still directly present as a presupposition of production. Production based on exchange value and the community based on the exchange of these exchange values—even though they seem, as we saw in the previous chapter on money, to posit property as the outcome of <span class="c1">labour</span> alone, and to posit private property over the product of one’s own labour as condition—and labour as general condition of wealth, all presuppose and produce the separation of labour from its objective conditions. This exchange of equivalents proceeds; it is only the surface layer of a production which rests on the appropriation of alien labour <span class="c1">without exchange</span>, but with the <span class="c1">semblance of exchange</span>. This system of exchange rests on <span class="c1">capital</span> as its foundation, and, when it is regarded in isolation from capital, as it appears on the surface, as an <span class="c1">independent</span> system, then it is a mere <span class="c1">illusion</span>, but a <span class="c1">necessary illusion</span>. Thus there is no longer any ground for astonishment that the system of exchange values—exchange of equivalents measured through labour—turns into, or rather reveals as its hidden background, the <span class="c1">appropriation of alien labour without</span> exchange, complete separation of labour and property. For the domination of exchange value itself, and of exchange-value-producing production, <span class="c1">presupposes</span> alien labour capacity itself as an exchange value—i.e. the separation of living labour capacity from its objective conditions; a relation to them—or to its own objectivity—as alien property; a relation to them, in a word, as <span class="c1">capital</span>. Only in the period of the decline and fall of the feudal system, but where it still struggles internally—as in England in the fourteenth and first half of the fifteenth centuries—is there a golden age for labour in the process of becoming emancipated. In order for labour to relate to its objective conditions as its property again, another system must take the place of the system of private exchange, which, as we saw, posits the exchange of objectified labour for labour capacity, and therefore the appropriation of living labour without exchange.—The way in which money transforms itself into capital often shows itself quite tangibly in history; e.g. when the merchant induces a number of weavers and spinners, who until then wove and spun as a rural, secondary occupation, to work for him, making their secondary into their chief occupation; but then has them in his power and has brought them under his command as wage labourers. To draw them away from their home towns and to concentrate them in a place of work is a further step. In this simple process it is clear that the capitalist has prepared neither the raw material, nor the instrument, nor the means of subsistence for the weaver and the spinner. All that he has done is to restrict them little by little to one kind of work in which they become dependent on selling, on the <span class="c1">buyer</span>, the <span class="c1">merchant</span>, and ultimately produce only <span class="c1">for</span> and <span class="c1">through</span> him. He bought their labour originally only by buying their product; as soon as they restrict themselves to the production of this exchange value and thus must directly produce <span class="c1">exchange values</span>, must exchange their labour entirely for money in order to survive, then they come under his command, and at the end even the illusion that they <span class="c1">sold</span> him products disappears. He buys their labour and takes their property first in the form of the product, and soon after that the instrument as well, or he leaves it to them as <span class="c1">sham property</span> in order to reduce his own production costs.—The original historic forms in which capital appears at first sporadically or <span class="c1">locally, alongside</span> the old modes of production, while exploding them little by little everywhere, is on one side <span class="c1">manufacture</span> proper (not yet the factory); this springs up where mass quantities are produced for export, for the external market—i.e. on the <span class="c1">basis of large-scale overland and maritime commerce</span>, in its emporiums like the Italian cities, Constantinople, in the Flemish, Dutch cities, a few Spanish ones, such as Barcelona etc. Manufacture seizes hold initially not of the so-called <span class="c1">urban trades</span>, but of the <span class="c1">rural secondary occupations</span>, spinning and weaving, the two which least requires guild-level skills, technical training. Apart from these great emporiums, where the external market is its basis, where production is thus, so to speak, <span class="c1">naturally</span> oriented towards exchange value—i.e. manufactures directly connected with shipping, shipbuilding itself etc.—it takes up its first residence not in the cities, but on the land, in villages lacking guilds etc. The rural subsidiary occupations have the broad basis [characteristic] of manufactures, while the urban trades demand great progress in production before they can be conducted in factory style. Likewise certain branches of production—such as glassworks, metal works, sawmills etc., which demand a higher concentration of labour powers from the outset, apply more natural energy from the outset, demand mass production, likewise concentration of the means of labour etc. Likewise paper mills. On the other side the rise of the tenant and the transformation of the agricultural population into free day-labourers. Although this transformation in the countryside is the last to push on towards its ultimate consequences and its purest form, its beginnings there are among the earliest. Classical antiquity, which could never get beyond the urban artisanate proper, could therefore never get to large industry. The first presupposition of the latter is to draw the land in all its expanse into the production not of use values but of exchange values. Glass factories, paper mills, iron works etc. cannot be operated on guild principles. They demand mass production; sales to a general market; <span class="c1">monetary wealth</span> on the part of their entrepreneur—not that he creates the conditions, neither the subjective nor the objective ones; but under the old relations of property and of production these conditions cannot be brought together.—The dissolution of relations of serfdom, like the rise of manufacture, then little by little transforms all branches of work into branches operated by capital.—The cities themselves, it is true, also contain an element for the formation of wage labour proper, in the non-guild day-labourers, unskilled labourers etc.</p><p class="s8">While, as we have seen, the transformation of money into capital presupposes a historic process which divorces the objective conditions of labour from the worker and makes them independent of him, it is at the same time the effect of capital and of its process, once arisen, to conquer all of production and to develop and complete the divorce between labour and property, between labour and the objective conditions of labour, everywhere. It will be seen in the course of the further development how capital destroys craft and artisan labour, working small-landownership etc., together with itself in forms in which it does <span class="c1">not</span> appear in opposition to labour—in <span class="c1">small capital</span> and in the intermediate species, the species between the old modes of production (or their renewal on the foundation of capital) and the classical, adequate mode of production of capital itself.</p><p class="s8">The only stockpiling presupposed at the origin of capital is that of <span class="c1">monetary wealth</span>, which, regarded in and for itself, is altogether unproductive, as it only springs up out of circulation and belongs exclusively to it. Capital rapidly forms an internal market for itself by destroying all rural secondary occupations, so that it spins, weaves for everyone, clothes everyone etc., in short, brings the commodities previously created as direct use values into the form of exchange values, a process which comes about by itself through the separation of the workers from land and soil and from property (even in the form of serf property) in the conditions of production.</p><p class="s8">With the urban crafts, although they rest essentially on exchange and on the creation of exchange values, the direct and chief aim of this production is <span class="c1">subsistence as craftsmen</span>, as <span class="c1">master-journeymen</span>, hence use value; not <span class="c1">wealth</span>, not <span class="c1">exchange value as exchange value</span>. Production is therefore always subordinated to a given consumption, supply to demand, and expands only slowly.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">The production of capitalists and wage labourers is thus a chief product of capital’s realization process.</span> Ordinary economics, which looks only at the things produced, forgets this completely. When objectified labour is, in this process, at the same time posited as the worker’s <span class="c1">non-objectivity</span>, as the objectivity of a subjectivity antithetical to the worker, as <span class="c1">property</span> of a will alien to him, then capital is necessarily at the same time the <span class="c1">capitalist</span>, and the idea held by some socialists that we need capital but not the capitalists is altogether wrong. It is posited within the concept of capital that the objective conditions of labour—and these are its own product—take on a <span class="c1">personality</span> towards it, or, what is the same, that they are posited as the property of a personality alien to the worker. The concept of capital contains the capitalist. * * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s25" id="calibre_pb_10">* * *</p>
