<p class="s33">On the Forms of Crisis</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Therefore:</p><p class="s8">1. The general <span class="c1">possibility</span> of crisis is given in the process of <span class="c1">metamorphosis of capital </span>itself, and in two ways: in so far as money functions as <span class="c1">means of circulation</span>, [the possibility of crisis lies in] the separation of <span class="c1">purchase and sale;</span> and in so far as money functions as <span class="c1">means of payment</span>, it has two different aspects, it acts as <span class="c1">measure of value</span> and <span class="c1">as realisation of value</span>. These two aspects [may] become separated. If <span class="c1">in the interval</span> between them the value has changed, if the commodity at the moment of its sale is not <span class="c1">worth</span> what it was <span class="c1">worth</span> at the moment when money was acting as a measure of value and therefore as a measure of the reciprocal obligations, then the obligation cannot be met from the <span class="c1">proceeds of the sale of the commodity</span>, and therefore the whole series of transactions which retrogressively depend on this one transaction, cannot be settled. If even for only a <span class="c1">limited period of time</span> the commodity cannot be sold then, although its value has not altered, <span class="c1">money</span> cannot function as <span class="c1">means of payment</span>, since it must function as such in a <span class="c1">definite given period of time</span>. But as the same sum of money acts for a whole series of reciprocal transactions and obligations here, <span class="c1">inability to pay</span> occurs not only at one, but at many points, hence a <span class="c1">crisis</span> arises.</p><p class="s8">These ate the <span class="c1">formal possibilities</span> of crisis The form mentioned first is possible without the latter,—that is to say, crises are possible without credit, without money functioning as a means of payment. But the second form is not possible <span class="c1">without the first</span>—that is to say, without the separation between purchase and sale. But in the latter case, the crisis occurs not only because the commodity is unsaleable, but because it is not saleable within a <span class="c1">particular period of time</span>, and the crisis arises and derives its character not only from the <span class="c1">unsaleability</span> of the commodity, but from the <span class="c1">non-fulfilment of a whole series of payments</span> which depend on the sale of this particular commodity within this particular period of time. This is the <span class="c1">characteristic form of money crises</span>.</p><p class="s8">If the crisis appears, therefore, because purchase and sale become separated, it becomes a <span class="c1">money crisis,</span> as soon as money has developed as <span class="c1">means of payment</span>, and this <span class="c1">second form</span> of crisis follows as a matter of course, when the <span class="c1">first occurs</span>. In investigating why the general <span class="c1">possibility</span> <span class="c1">of crisis</span> turns into a <span class="c1">real </span>crisis, in investigating the <span class="c1">conditions </span>of crisis, it is therefore quite superfluous to concern oneself with the <span class="c1">forms</span> of crisis which arise out of the development of money as <span class="c1">means of payment.</span> This is precisely why economists like to suggest that this <span class="c1">obvious</span> form is the <span class="c1">cause</span> of crises. (In so far as the development of money as means of payment is linked with the development of credit and of <span class="c1">excess credit</span> the causes of the latter have to be examined, but this is not yet the place to do it.)</p><p class="s8">2. In so far as crises arise from <span class="c1">changes in prices and revolutions in prices</span>, which do not coincide with <span class="c1">changes in the values</span> of commodities, they naturally cannot be investigated during the examination of capital in general, in which the prices of commodities are assumed to be <span class="c1">identical</span> with the <span class="c1">values</span> of commodities.</p><p class="s8">3. The <span class="c1">general possibility</span> of crisis is the formal <span class="c1">metamorphosis</span> of capital itself, the separation, in time and space, of purchase and sale. But this is never the cause of the crisis. For it is nothing but the <span class="c1">most general</span> <span class="c1">form of crisis</span>, i.e., the crisis itself in <span class="c1">its most generalised expression</span>. But it cannot be said that the <span class="c1">abstract form of crisis</span> is the <span class="c1">cause of crisis</span>. If one asks what its cause is, one wants to know why <span class="c1">its abstract form</span>, the form of its possibility, turns from possibility into <span class="c1">actuality</span>.</p><p class="s8">4. The <span class="c1">general conditions</span> of crisis, in so far as they are independent of <span class="c1">price fluctuations</span> (whether these are linked with the credit system or not) as distinct from fluctuations in value, must be explicable from the general conditions of capitalist production.</p><p class="s8">(A <span class="c1">crisis</span> can arise: 1. in the course of the <span class="c1">reconversion</span> [of money] <span class="c1">into productive capital;</span> 2. through <span class="c1">changes in the value</span> of the elements of productive capital, particularly of <span class="c1">raw material</span>, for example when there is a decrease in the quantity of cotton harvested. Its <span class="c1">value</span> will thus rise. We are not as yet concerned with prices here but with <span class="c1">values</span>.)</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First Phase</span>. The <span class="c1">reconversion of money into capital.</span> A definite level of <span class="c1">production or reproduction</span> is assumed. Fixed capital can be regarded here as given, as remaining unchanged and not entering into the <span class="c1">process of the creation of value</span>. Since the reproduction of raw material is not dependent solely on the labour employed on it, but on the productivity of this labour which is bound up with <span class="c1">natural conditions</span>, it is possible for the volume, the <span class="c1">amount</span> of the product of the <span class="c1">same </span>quantity of labour, to fall (as a result of bad <span class="c1">harvests</span>). The <span class="c1">value of the raw material therefore rises;</span> its <span class="c1">volume</span> decreases, in other words the <span class="c1">proportions</span> in which the money has to be reconverted into the <span class="c1">various component parts of capital</span> in order to continue production on the former scale, are upset. More must be expended <span class="c1">on raw material</span>, less remains for <span class="c1">labour</span>, and it is not possible to absorb the same quantity of labour as before. Firstly this is <span class="c1">physically impossible</span>, because of the deficiency in raw material. <span class="c1">Secondly</span>, it is impossible because a greater <span class="c1">portion of the value of the product</span> has to be converted into raw material, thus leaving less for conversion into <span class="c1">variable capital</span>. Reproduction cannot be <span class="c1">repeated </span>on the same scale. A part of <span class="c1">fixed capital</span> stands idle and a part of the workers is thrown out on the streets. The <span class="c1">rate of profit</span> falls because the value of constant capital has risen as against that of variable capital and less variable capital is employed. The fixed charges—interests, rent—which were based on the anticipation of a <span class="c1">constant</span> rate of profit and exploitation of labour, remain the same and in part <span class="c1">cannot be paid</span>. Hence <span class="c1">crisis</span>. Crisis of labour and crisis of capital. This is therefore a <span class="c1">disturbance in the reproduction process</span> due to the increase in the value of that part of constant capital which has to be replaced out of the value of the product. Moreover, although the <span class="c1">rate of profit</span> is decreasing, there is a <span class="c1">rise in the price of the product</span>. If this product enters into other spheres of production as a means of production, the rise its price will result in the same disturbance in <span class="c1">reproduction</span> in these spheres. If it enters into general consumption as a means of subsistence, it either enters also into <span class="c1">the consumption of the workers</span> or <span class="c1">not</span>. If it does so, then its effects will be the same as those of a disturbance in <span class="c1">variable capital</span>, of which we shall speak later. But in so far as it enters into <span class="c1">general consumption</span> it may result (if its consumption is not reduced) in a diminished <span class="c1">demand</span> for other products and consequently <span class="c1">prevent their reconversion</span> into money at their value, thus disturbing the other <span class="c1">aspect</span> of their reproduction—not the <span class="c1">reconversion of money</span> into productive capital but the <span class="c1">reconversion</span> of commodities into money. In any case, the <span class="c1">volume of profits</span> and the <span class="c1">volume of wages</span> is reduced in this branch of production thereby reducing a <span class="c1">part of the necessary returns</span> from the sale of commodities from other branches of production.</p><p class="s8">Such a <span class="c1">shortage of raw material</span> may, however, occur not only because of the <span class="c1">influence of harvests</span> or of the <span class="c1">natural productivity</span> of the labour which supplies the raw material. For if an <span class="c1">excessive portion of the surplus-value, of the additional capital</span>, is laid out in machinery etc. in a particular branch of production, then, although the raw material would have been sufficient for the <span class="c1">old level of production</span>, it will be insufficient for the <span class="c1">new</span>. This therefore arises from the <span class="c1">disproportionate</span> conversion of additional capital into its various elements. It is a case of <span class="c1">over-production of fixed capital</span> and gives rise to exactly the same phenomena as occur in the first case. (See the previous page.)<a id="footnote-ref296" href="part0057.html#footnote296" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">296</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> Or they [the crises] are due to an <span class="c1">over-production of fixed capital</span> and therefore a relative under-production of circulating capital. </p><p class="s8">Since fixed capital, like circulating, consists of commodities, it is quite ridiculous that the same economists who admit the <span class="c1">over-production of fixed capital</span>, deny the <span class="c1">over-production of commodities</span>.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_8">5. <span class="c1">Crises arising from disturbances in the first phase of reproduction:</span> that is to say, interrupted conversion of commodities into money or <span class="c1">interruption of sale</span>. In the case of crisis of the first sort [which result from the rise in the price of raw materials] the crisis arises from interruptions in the <span class="c1">flowing back</span> of the elements of productive capital.</p>
