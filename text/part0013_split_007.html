Absolute Knowledge</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Hegel’s <span class="c1">Encyclopaedia</span>,<a id="footnote-ref137" href="part0057.html#footnote137" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">137</sup></span></a> beginning as it does with Logic, with <span class="c1">pure speculative thought</span>, and ending with <span class="c1">Absolute Knowledge</span>—with the self-conscious, self-comprehending, philosophic or absolute (i.e., superhuman) abstract mind—is in its entirety nothing but the <span class="c1">display</span>, the self-objectification, of the <span class="c1">essence </span>of the philosophic mind, and the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self-estrangement—i.e., comprehending itself abstractly. <span class="c1">Logic</span> (mind’s <span class="c1">coin of the realm</span>, the speculative or <span class="c1">thought-value</span> of man and nature—their essence grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness, and hence their unreal essence) is <span class="c1">alienated thinking</span>, and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man: <span class="c1">abstract</span> thinking. Then: <span class="c1">The externality of this abstract thinking . . .</span> nature, as it is for this abstract thinking. Nature is external to it—its self-loss; and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion, as abstract thinking—but as alienated abstract thinking. Finally, <span class="c1">Mind</span>, this thinking returning home to its own point of origin—the thinking which, as the anthropological, phenomenological, psychological, ethical, artistic and religious mind, is not valid for itself, until ultimately it finds itself, and relates itself to itself, as <span class="c1">absolute</span> knowledge in the hence absolute, i.e., abstract mind, and so receives its conscious embodiment in a mode of being corresponding to it. For its real mode of being is <span class="c1">abstraction</span>.</p><p class="s8">There is double error in Hegel.</p><p class="s8">The first emerges most clearly in the <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span>, the Hegelian philosophy’s place of origin. When, for instance, wealth, state-power, etc., are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the <span class="c1">human</span> being, this only happens in their form as thoughts . . . They are thought-entities, and therefore merely an estrangement of <span class="c1">pure</span>, i.e., abstract, philosophical thinking. The whole process therefore ends with Absolute Knowledge. It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their arrogation of reality. The <span class="c1">philosopher</span> sets up himself (that is, one who is himself an abstract form of estranged man) as the <span class="c1">measuring-rod</span> of the estranged world. The whole <span class="c1">history of the alienation-process</span> and the whole <span class="c1">process of the retraction</span> of the alienation is therefore nothing but <span class="c1">the history of the production</span> of abstract (i.e., absolute) thought—of logical, speculative thought. The <span class="c1">estrangement</span>, which therefore forms the real interest of this alienation and of the transcendence of this alienation, is the opposition of <span class="c1">in itself</span> and <span class="c1">for itself</span>, of <span class="c1">consciousness</span> and <span class="c1">self-consciousness</span>, of <span class="c1">object</span> and <span class="c1">subject</span>—that is to say, it is the opposition, within thought itself, between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness. All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the <span class="c1">semblance, the cloak, the exoteric</span> shape of these oppositions which alone matter, and which constitute the <span class="c1">meaning</span> of these other, profane oppositions. It is not the fact that the human being <span class="c1">objectifies himself inhumanly</span>, in opposition to himself, but the fact that he <span class="c1">objectifies himself</span> in <span class="c1">distinction</span> from and in <span class="c1">opposition </span>to abstract thinking, that is the posited essence of the estrangement and the thing to be superseded. </p><p class="s8">The appropriation of man’s essential powers, which have become objects—indeed, alien objects—is thus in the <span class="c1">first place</span> only an <span class="c1">appropriation</span> occurring in <span class="c1">consciousness</span>, in <span class="c1">pure thought</span>—i.e., in <span class="c1">abstraction:</span> it is the appropriation of these objects as <span class="c1">thoughts</span> and as <span class="c1">movements of thought</span>. Consequently, despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the criticism really contained in it, which often anticipates far later development, there is already latent in the <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span> as a germ, a potentiality, a secret, the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel’s later works—that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world. In the <span class="c1">second place:</span> the vindication of the objective world for man—for example, the realization that <span class="c1">sensuous</span> consciousness is not an <span class="c1">abstractly</span> sensuous consciousness but a <span class="c1">humanly</span> sensuous consciousness—that religion, wealth, etc., are but the estranged world of <span class="c1">human</span> objectification, of <span class="c1">man’s</span> essential powers given over to work and that they are therefore but the <span class="c1">path</span> to the true <span class="c1">human</span> world—this appropriation or the insight into this process consequently appears in Hegel in this form, that <span class="c1">sense, religion,</span> state-power, etc., are <span class="c1">spiritual</span> entities; for only <span class="c1">mind</span> is the <span class="c1">true</span> essence of man, and the true form of mind is thinking mind, the logical, speculative mind. The <span class="c1">humanness</span> of nature and of the nature begotten by history—the humanness of man’s products—appears in the form that they are <span class="c1">products</span> of abstract mind and as such, therefore, phases of <span class="c1">mind</span>—<span class="c1">thought entities</span>. The <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span> is, therefore, an occult critique—still to itself obscure and mystifying criticism; but inasmuch as it keeps steadily in view man’s <span class="c1">estrangement</span>, even though man appears only in the shape of mind, there lie concealed in it <span class="c1">all</span> the elements of criticism, already <span class="c1">prepared</span> and <span class="c1">elaborated</span> in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint. The “Unhappy Consciousness,” the “Honest Consciousness,” the struggle of the “Noble and Base Consciousness,”<a id="footnote-ref138" href="part0057.html#footnote138" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">138</sup></span></a> etc., etc.,—these separate sections contain, but still in an estranged form, the <span class="c1">critical</span> elements of whole spheres such as religion, the state, civil life, etc. Just as <span class="c1">entities, objects,</span> appear as <span class="c1">thought-entities</span>, so the <span class="c1">subject</span> is always <span class="c1">consciousness</span> or <span class="c1">self-consciousness;</span> or rather the object appears only as <span class="c1">abstract</span> consciousness, man only as <span class="c1">self-consciousness:</span> the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are, therefore, only various forms of consciousness and self-consciousness. Just as <span class="c1">in itself</span> abstract consciousness (the form in which the object is conceived) is merely a moment of distinction of self-consciousness, what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self-consciousness with consciousness—absolute knowledge—the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but going on now only within its own self: that is to say, the dialectic of pure thought is the result.</p><p class="s8">The outstanding thing in Hegel’s <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span> and its final outcome—that is, the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle—is thus first that Hegel conceives the self-genesis of man as a process, conceives objectification as loss of the object, as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation; that he thus grasps the essence of <span class="c1">labour</span> and comprehends objective man—true, because real man—as the outcome of man’s <span class="c1">own labour</span>. The <span class="c1">real</span>, active orientation of man to himself as a species being, or his manifestation as a real species being (i.e., as a human being), is only possible by his really bringing out of himself all the <span class="c1">powers</span> that are his as the <span class="c1">species</span> man—something which in turn is only possible through the totality of man’s actions, as the result of history—is only possible by man’s treating these generic powers as objects: and this, to begin with, is again only possible in the form of estrangement.</p><p class="s8">We shall now demonstrate in detail Hegel’s one-sidedness and limitations as they are displayed in the final chapter of the <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span>, “Absolute Knowledge”—a chapter which contains the concentrated spirit of the <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span>, the relationship of the <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span> to speculative dialectic, and also Hegel’s <span class="c1">consciousness </span>concerning both and their relationship to one another.</p><p class="s8">Let us provisionally say just this much in advance: Hegel’s standpoint is that of modern political economy. He grasps <span class="c1">labour</span> as the <span class="c1">essence</span> of man—as man’s essence in the act of proving itself: he sees only the positive, not the negative side of labour. Labour is man’s <span class="c1">coming-to-be for himself</span> within <span class="c1">alienation</span>, or as <span class="c1">alienated</span> man. The only labour which Hegel knows and recognizes is <span class="c1">abstractly mental</span> labour. Therefore, that which constitutes the essence of philosophy—the <span class="c1">alienation of man in his knowing of himself</span>, or <span class="c1">alienated</span> science <span class="c1">thinking itself</span>—Hegel grasps as its essence; and he is therefore able <span class="c1">vis-à-vis</span> preceding philosophy to gather together its separate elements and phases, and to present his philosophy as the philosophy. What the other philosophers did—that they grasped separate phases of nature and of human life as phases of self-consciousness, and indeed of abstract self-consciousness—is <span class="c1">known</span> to Hegel as the <span class="c1">doings</span> of philosophy. Hence his science is absolute.</p><p class="s8">Let us now turn to our subject.</p><p class="s34">Absolute Knowledge. The last chapter of the “Phenomenology.”</p><p class="s8">The main point is that the <span class="c1">object of consciousness</span> is nothing else but <span class="c1">self-consciousness</span>, or that the object is only <span class="c1">objectified self-consciousness</span>—self-consciousness as object. </p><p class="s8">(Positing of man=self-consciousness.)</p><p class="s8">The issue, therefore, is to surmount the <span class="c1">object of consciousness</span>. <span class="c1">Objectivity</span> as such is regarded as an <span class="c1">estranged</span> human relationship which does not correspond to <span class="c1">the essence of man</span>, to self-consciousness. The <span class="c1">re-appropriation</span> of the objective essence of man, begotten in the form of estrangement as something alien, has the meaning therefore not only to annul <span class="c1">estrangement</span>, but <span class="c1">objectivity</span> as well. Man, that is to say, is regarded as a <span class="c1">non-objective, spiritual</span> being.</p><p class="s8">The movement of <span class="c1">surmounting the object of consciousness</span> is now described by Hegel in the following way:</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">object</span> reveals itself not merely as <span class="c1">returning into the self</span>—for Hegel that is the <span class="c1">one-sided</span> way of apprehending this movement, the grasping of only one side. Man is posited as equivalent to self. The self, however, is only the <span class="c1">abstractly</span> conceived man—man begotten by abstraction. Man <span class="c1">is</span> egotistic. His eye, his ear, etc., are <span class="c1">egotistic</span>. In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of <span class="c1">selfhood</span>. But it is quite false to say on that account <span class="c1">“Self-consciousness</span> has eyes, ears, essential powers.” Self-consciousness is rather a quality of human nature, of the human eye, etc.; it is not human nature that is a quality of <span class="c1">self-consciousness.</span></p><p class="s8">The self-abstracted and fixed for itself is man as <span class="c1">abstract egoist</span>—<span class="c1">egoism</span> raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought. (We shall return to this point later.) </p><p class="s8">For Hegel the essence of <span class="c1">man—man</span>—equals <span class="c1">self-consciousness</span>. All estrangement of the human essence is therefore <span class="c1">nothing but estrangement of self-consciousness</span>. The estrangement of self-consciousness is not regarded as an <span class="c1">expression</span> of the <span class="c1">real</span> estrangement of the human being—its expression reflected in the realm of knowledge and thought. Instead, the <span class="c1">real</span> estrangement—that which appears real—is from its <span class="c1">innermost</span>, hidden nature (a nature only brought to light by philosophy) nothing but the <span class="c1">manifestation</span> of the estrangement of the real essence of man, of <span class="c1">self-consciousness.</span> The science which comprehends this is therefore called <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span>. All re-appropriation of the estranged objective essence appears, therefore, as a process of incorporation into self-consciousness: The man who takes hold of his essential being is <span class="c1">merely</span> the self-consciousness which takes hold of objective essences. Return of the object into the self is therefore the re-appropriation of the object.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">surmounting of the object of consciousness, comprehensively</span> expressed, means:<a id="footnote-ref139" href="part0057.html#footnote139" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">139</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">(1) That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing. (2) That it is the alienation of self-consciousness which establishes thinghood. (3) That this externalization<a id="footnote-ref140" href="part0057.html#footnote140" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">140</sup></span></a> of self-consciousness has not merely a <span class="c1">negative</span> but a <span class="c1">positive</span> significance. (4) That it has this meaning not merely <span class="c1">for us</span> or <span class="c1">intrinsically</span>, but <span class="c1">for self-consciousness itself.</span> (5) For <span class="c1">self-consciousness</span>, the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has <span class="c1">positive</span> significance—self-consciousness <span class="c1">knows</span> this nullity of the object—because self-consciousness itself alienates itself; for in this alienation it establishes <span class="c1">itself</span> as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of <span class="c1">being-for-self</span>, establishes the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that self-consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with <span class="c1">itself</span> in <span class="c1">its</span> other-being <span class="c1">as such</span>. (7) This is the movement of <span class="c1">consciousness</span> and in this movement consciousness is the totality of its moments. (8) Consciousness must similarly have taken up a relation to the object in all its aspects and phases, and have comprehended it from the point of view of each of them. This totality of its determinate characteristics makes the object <span class="c1">intrinsically a spiritual being;</span> and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each single one of them as <span class="c1">self</span> or through what was called above the <span class="c1">spiritual</span> attitude to them.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1"> As to (1):</span> That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing—this is the above-mentioned <span class="c1">return of the object into the self.</span></p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">As to (2):</span> <span class="c1">The alienation of self-consciousness</span> establishes <span class="c1">thinghood.</span> Because man equals self-consciousness, his alienated, objective essence, or <span class="c1">thinghood</span>, <span class="c1">equals alienated self-consciousness</span>, and <span class="c1">thinghood</span> is thus established through this alienation (thinghood being <span class="c1">that</span> which is an <span class="c1">object for man</span> and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object, therefore his <span class="c1">objective essence</span>. And since it is not <span class="c1">real Man</span>, nor therefore <span class="c1">Nature</span>—Man being <span class="c1">human Nature</span>—who as such is made the subject, but only the abstraction of man—self-consciousness—thinghood cannot be anything but alienated self-consciousness). It is only to be expected that a living, natural being equipped and endowed with objective (i.e., material) essential powers should have <span class="c1">real natural objects</span> of his essence; as is the fact that his self-alienation should lead to the establishing of a <span class="c1">real</span>, objective world—but a world in the form of <span class="c1">externality</span>—a world, therefore, not belonging to his own essential being, and an over powering world. There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this. It would be mysterious, rather, if it were otherwise. But it is equally clear that a <span class="c1">self-consciousness</span> can only establish <span class="c1">thinghood </span>through its alienation—i.e., establish something which itself is only an abstract thing, a thing of abstraction and not a <span class="c1">real</span> thing. It is clear, further, that thinghood is therefore utterly without any <span class="c1">independence</span>, any <span class="c1">essentiality vis-à-vis</span> self-consciousness; that on the contrary, it is a mere creature—something <span class="c1">posited</span> by self-consciousness. And what is posited, instead of confirming itself, is but a confirmation of the act of positing in which s concentrated for a moment the energy of the act as its product, <span class="c1">seeming</span> to give the de-posit—but only for a moment—the character of an independent, real substance.<a id="footnote-ref141" href="part0057.html#footnote141" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">141</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Whenever real, corporeal <span class="c1">man</span>, man with his feet firmly on the solid ground, man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature, <span class="c1">establishes</span> his real, objective <span class="c1">essential</span> <span class="c1">powers </span>as alien objects by his externalization, it is not the <span class="c1">act of positing</span> which is the subject in this process: it is the subjectivity of <span class="c1">objective</span> essential powers, whose action, therefore, must also be something <span class="c1">objective</span>. A being who is objective acts objectively, and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being. He creates or establishes only <span class="c1">objects, because</span> he is established by objects—because at bottom he is <span class="c1">nature.</span> In the act of establishing, therefore, this objective being does not fall from his state of “pure activity” into a <span class="c1">creating of the object;</span> on the contrary, his <span class="c1">objective</span> product only confirms his <span class="c1">objective </span>activity, establishing his activity as the activity of an objective, natural being.</p><p class="s8">Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism distinguishes itself both from idealism and materialism, constituting at the same time the unifying truth of both. We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the act of world history.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Man</span> is directly a <span class="c1">natural being</span>. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand furnished with <span class="c1">natural powers of life</span>—he is an <span class="c1">active</span> natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities—as <span class="c1">impulses</span>. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous, objective being he is a <span class="c1">suffering</span>, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the <span class="c1">objects</span> of his impulses exist outside him, as <span class="c1">objects</span> independent of him; yet these objects are <span class="c1">objects</span> of his <span class="c1">need</span>—essential <span class="c1">objects</span>, indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers. To say that man is a <span class="c1">corporeal</span>, living, real, sensuous, objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has <span class="c1">real, sensuous, objects</span> as the objects of his being or of his life, or that he can only <span class="c1">express</span> his life in real, sensuous objects. To be objective, natural and sensuous, and at the same time to have object, nature and sense outside oneself, or oneself to be object, nature and sense for a third party, is one and the same thing. <span class="c1">Hunger</span> is a natural <span class="c1">need;</span> it therefore needs a <span class="c1">nature </span>outside itself, an <span class="c1">object</span> outside itself, in order to satisfy itself, to be stilled. Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an <span class="c1">object</span> existing outside it, indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being. The sun is the <span class="c1">object</span> of the plant—an indispensable object to it, confirming its life—just as the plant is an object of the sun, being an <span class="c1">expression</span> of the life-awakening power of the sun, of the sun’s <span class="c1">objective</span> essential power.</p><p class="s8">A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a <span class="c1">natural</span> being, and plays no part in the system of nature. A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being. A being which is not itself an object for some third being has no being for its <span class="c1">object;</span> i.e., it is not objectively related. Its be-ing is not objective.<a id="footnote-ref142" href="part0057.html#footnote142" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">142</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">An unobjective being is a <span class="c1">nullity</span>—an un-being.</p><p class="s8">Suppose a being which is neither an object itself, nor has an object. Such a being, in the first place, would be the <span class="c1">unique</span> being: there would exist no being outside it—it would exist solitary and alone. For as soon as there are objects outside me, as soon as I am not <span class="c1">alone</span>, I am <span class="c1">another—another</span> <span class="c1">reality </span>than the object outside me. For this third object I am thus an <span class="c1">other reality</span> than it; that is, I am <span class="c1">its</span> object. Thus, to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that <span class="c1">no</span> objective being exists. As soon as I have an object, this object has me for an object. But a <span class="c1">non-objective</span> being is an unreal, nonsensical thing—something merely thought of (merely imagined, that is)—a creature of abstraction. To be <span class="c1">sensuous</span>, that is, to be an object of sense, to be a <span class="c1">sensuous</span> object, and thus to have sensuous objects outside oneself—objects of one’s sensuousness. To be sensuous is to <span class="c1">suffer</span>.<a id="footnote-ref143" href="part0057.html#footnote143" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">143</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Man as an objective, sensuous being is therefore a <span class="c1">suffering</span> being—and because he feels what he suffers, a <span class="c1">passionate</span> being. Passion is the essential force of man energetically bent on its object.</p><p class="s8">But man is not merely a natural being: he is a <span class="c1">human</span> natural being. That is to say, he is a being for himself. Therefore he is a <span class="c1">species being</span>, and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing. Therefore, <span class="c1">human</span> objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves, and neither is <span class="c1">human sense</span> as it immediately <span class="c1">is</span>—as it is objectively—<span class="c1">human</span> sensibility, human objectivity. Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the <span class="c1">human</span> being. And as everything natural has to have its <span class="c1">beginning, man</span> too has his act of coming-to-be—<span class="c1">history</span>—which, however, is for him a known history, and hence as an act of coming-to-be it is a conscious self-transcending act of coming-to-be.

(6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus <span class="c1">at home with itself</span> in its <span class="c1">other-being as such.</span></p><p class="s8">As we have already seen: the appropriation of what is estranged and objective, or the annulling of objectivity in the form of <span class="c1">estrangement </span>(which has to advance from indifferent foreignness to real, antagonistic estrangement) means equally or even primarily for Hegel that it is <span class="c1">objectivity</span> which is to be annulled, because it is not the <span class="c1">determinate</span> character of the object, but rather its <span class="c1">objective</span> character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self-consciousness.

Knowing is its sole objective relation.

Or: knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only <span class="c1">outside itself</span>—that it only externalizes itself; that <span class="c1">it itself</span> appears to itself only <span class="c1">as an object</span>—or that that which appears to it as an object is only it itself.</p><p class="s8">On the other hand, says Hegel, there is at the same time this other moment in this process, that consciousness has just as much annulled and superseded this externalization and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus <span class="c1">at home</span> in <span class="c1">its other-being as such</span>.</p><p class="s8">In this discussion are brought together all the illusions of speculation.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First of all:</span> consciousness—self-consciousness—is <span class="c1">at home with itself in its other-being as such.</span> It is therefore—or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self-consciousness of man instead of Self-consciousness—it is <span class="c1">at home with itself in its other-being, as such</span>. This implies, for one thing, that consciousness (knowing as knowing, thinking as thinking) pretend to be directly the <span class="c1">other</span> of itself—to be the world of sense, the real world, life—thought over-reaching itself in thought (Feuerbach).<a id="footnote-ref145" href="part0057.html#footnote145" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">145</sup></span></a> This aspect is contained herein, inasmuch as consciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity, but at <span class="c1">objectivity</span> as such.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Secondly</span>, this implies that self-conscious man, in so far as he has recognized and annulled and superseded the spiritual world (or his world’s spiritual, general mode of being) as self-alienation, nevertheless again confirms this in its alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being—re-establishes it, and pretends to be <span class="c1">at home in his other-being as such.</span> Thus, for instance, after annulling and superseding religion, after recognizing religion to be a product of self-alienation, he yet finds confirmation of himself in <span class="c1">religion as religion</span>.

Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason. The man who has recognized that he is leading an alienated life in politics, law, etc., is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such.

This is the insight, expressed within the estrangement, concerning the <span class="c1">appropriation</span> of the objective essence through the annulment of its estrangement; it is the estranged insight into the <span class="c1">real objectification</span> of man, into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the <span class="c1">estranged </span>character of the objective world, through the annulment of the objective world in its estranged mode of being—just as atheism, being the annulment of God, is the advent of theoretic humanism, and communism, as the annulment of private property, is the justification of real human life as man’s possession and thus the advent of practical humanism (or just as atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of religion, whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of private property). Only through the annulment of this mediation—which is itself, however, a necessary premise—does positively self-deriving humanism, <span class="c1">positive humanism</span>, come into being.</p><p class="s8">But atheism and communism are no flight, no abstraction; they are not a losing of the objective world begotten by man—of man’s essential powers given over to the realm of objectivity; they are not a returning in poverty to unnatural, primitive simplicity. On the contrary, they are but the first real coming-to-be, the realization become real for man, of man’s essence—of the essence of man as something real.</p><p class="s8">Thus, by grasping the <span class="c1">positive</span> meaning of self-referred negation (if even again in estranged fashion) Hegel grasps man’s self-estrangement, the alienation of man’s essence, man’s loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as finding of self, change of his nature, his objectification and realization. In short, within the sphere of abstraction, Hegel conceives labour as man’s act of <span class="c1">self-genesis</span>—conceives man’s relation to himself as an alien being and the manifesting of himself as an alien being to be the coming-to-be of <span class="c1">species-consciousness and species-life.</span></p><p class="s8">(b) However, apart from, or rather in consequence of, the perverseness already described, this act appears in Hegel: </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First of all as a merely formal,</span> because abstract, act, because the human essence itself is taken to be only an <span class="c1">abstract, thinking essence,</span> conceived merely as self-consciousness. And, </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">secondly,</span> because the conception is <span class="c1">formal</span> and <span class="c1">abstract</span>, the annulment of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation; or again, for Hegel this movement of <span class="c1">self-genesis</span> and <span class="c1">self-objectification</span> in the form of <span class="c1">self-alienation</span> and <span class="c1">self-estrangement</span> is the <span class="c1">absolute</span>, and hence final<span class="c1">, expression of human life</span>—of life with itself as its aim, of life at rest in itself, of life that has attained oneness with its essence.</p><p class="s8">This movement, in its abstract form as dialectic, is therefore regarded <span class="c1">as truly human life</span>, and because it is nevertheless an abstraction—an estrangement of human life—it is regarded as a <span class="c1">divine process</span>, but as the divine process of man, a process traversed by man’s abstract, pure, absolute essence that is distinct from him.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Thirdly</span>, this process must have a bearer, a subject. But the subject first emerges as a result. This result—the subject knowing itself as absolute self-consciousness—is therefore God—<span class="c1">absolute Spirit—the self-knowing and self-manifesting Idea. </span>Real man and real nature become mere predicates—symbols of this esoteric, unreal man and of this unreal nature. Subject and predicate are therefore related to each other in absolute inversion—a <span class="c1">mystical subject-object</span> or a <span class="c1">subjectivity reaching beyond </span>the<span class="c1"> object</span>—the <span class="c1">absolute subject</span> as a <span class="c1">process</span>, as <span class="c1">subject alienating</span> itself and returning from alienation into itself, but at the same time retracting this alienation into itself, and the subject as this process; a pure, <span class="c1">restless</span> revolving within itself.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First</span>, the <span class="c1">formal and abstract</span> conception of man’s act of self-genesis or self-objectification.</p><p class="s8">Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self-consciousness, the estranged object—the estranged essential reality of man—is nothing but <span class="c1">consciousness</span>, the thought of estrangement merely—estrangement’s <span class="c1">abstract</span> and therefore empty and unreal expression, <span class="c1">negation</span>. The annulment of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract, empty annulment of that empty abstraction—the <span class="c1">negation of the negation</span>. The rich, living, sensuous, concrete activity of self-objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction, <span class="c1">absolute negativity</span>—an abstraction which is again fixed as such and thought of as an independent activity—as sheer activity. Because this so-called negativity is nothing but the <span class="c1">abstract</span>, <span class="c1">empty</span> form of that real living act, its content can in consequence be merely a <span class="c1">formal</span> content begotten by abstraction from all content. As a result there are general, abstract <span class="c1">forms of abstraction</span> pertaining to every content and on that account indifferent to, and, consequently, valid for, all content—the thought-forms or logical categories torn from <span class="c1">real</span> mind and from <span class="c1">real</span> nature. (We shall unfold the <span class="c1">logical</span> content of absolute negativity further on.)</p><p class="s8">Hegel’s positive achievement here, in his speculative logic, is that the <span class="c1">determinate concepts</span>, the universal <span class="c1">fixed thought-forms</span> in their independence <span class="c1">vis-à-vis</span> nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human essence and therefore also of human thought, and that Hegel has therefore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction-process. For example, superseded Being is Essence, superseded Essence is Concept, the Concept superseded is . . . the Absolute Idea. But what, then, is the Absolute Idea? It supersedes its own self again, if it does not want to traverse once more from the beginning the whole act of abstraction, and to acquiesce in being a totality of abstractions or in being the self-comprehending abstraction. But abstraction comprehending itself as abstraction knows itself to be nothing: it must abandon itself—abandon abstraction—and so it arrives at an entity which is its exact contrary—at <span class="c1">nature</span>. Thus, the entire <span class="c1">Logic</span> is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself; that the Absolute Idea is nothing in itself; that only <span class="c1">Nature</span> is something.</p><p class="s8">The absolute idea, the <span class="c1">abstract</span> idea, which “considered with regard to its unity with itself is intuiting,”<a id="footnote-ref148" href="part0057.html#footnote148" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">148</sup></span></a> (Hegel’s <span class="c1">Encyclopaedia</span>, 3rd edition, p. 222), and which “in its own absolute truth <span class="c1">resolves</span> to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterization and other-being—the <span class="c1">immediate idea,</span> as its reflection, <span class="c1">go forth freely from itself as nature”</span> (l.c.)—this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and singular way, and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches, is from beginning to end nothing else but <span class="c1">abstraction</span> (i.e., the abstract thinker)—abstraction which, made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth, resolves under various (false and themselves still abstract) conditions to <span class="c1">abandon itself</span> and to replace its self-absorption, nothingness, generality and indeterminateness by its other-being, the particular, and the determinate; resolves to let <span class="c1">nature</span>, which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction, as a thought-entity, <span class="c1">go forth freely from itself:</span> that is to say, abstraction resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature <span class="c1">free</span> of abstraction. The abstract idea, which without mediation becomes <span class="c1">intuiting</span>, is nothing else through-and-through but abstract thinking that gives itself up and resolves on <span class="c1">intuition</span>. This entire transition from Logic to Natural Philosophy is nothing else but the transition—so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker and therefore so queer in his description of it—from <span class="c1">abstracting </span>to <span class="c1">intuiting</span>. The <span class="c1">mystical</span> feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is <span class="c1">boredom</span>—the longing for a content.</p><p class="s8">(The man estranged from himself is also the thinker estranged from his <span class="c1">essence</span>—that is, from the natural and human essence. His thoughts are therefore fixed mental shapes or ghosts dwelling outside nature and man. Hegel has locked up all these fixed mental forms together in his <span class="c1">Logic</span>, laying hold of each of them first as negation—that is, as an <span class="c1">alienation </span>of<span class="c1"> human </span>thought—and then as negation of the negation—that is, as a superseding of this alienation, as a <span class="c1">real</span> expression of human thought. But as even this still takes place within the confines of the estrangement, this negation of the negation is in part the restoring of these fixed forms in their estrangement; in part a stopping-short at the last act—the act of self-reference in alienation—as the true mode of being of these fixed mental forms;<a id="footnote-ref149" href="part0057.html#footnote149" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">149</sup></span></a> and in part, to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself, there makes its appearance in Hegel, in the form of the resolution to recognize <span class="c1">nature</span> as the essential being and to go over to intuition, the abandonment of abstract thought—the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought, of thought devoid of eyes, of teeth, of ears, of everything.)</p><p class="s8">But <span class="c1">nature</span> too, taken abstractly, for itself—nature fixed in isolation from man—is <span class="c1">nothing</span> for man. It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting, intuits nature abstractly. Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea, in the form of a thought-entity—in a shape which is his and yet is esoteric and mysterious even to him—so what he has let go forth from himself in truth is only this <span class="c1">abstract nature</span>, only nature as a <span class="c1">thought-entity</span>—but with the significance now of being the other-being of thought, of being real, intuited nature—of being nature distinguished from abstract thought. Or, to talk a human language, the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing, from pure abstraction—the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought forever weaving in itself and never looking outward—are nothing else but <span class="c1">abstractions</span> from <span class="c1">characteristics of nature</span>. To him, therefore, the whole of nature merely repeats the logical abstractions in a sensuous, external form. He analyses it and these abstractions over again. Thus, his intuition of nature is only the act of confirming his abstraction from the intuition of nature—is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of begetting his abstraction. Thus, for example, Time equals Negativity referred to itself (l.c., p. 238): to the superseded Becoming as Being there corresponds, in natural form, superseded Movement as Matter. Light is <span class="c1">Reflection-in-Itself</span>, in <span class="c1">natural</span> form. Body as <span class="c1">Moon</span> and <span class="c1">Comet</span> is the <span class="c1">natural</span> form of the <span class="c1">antithesis</span> which according to the <span class="c1">Logic</span> is on the one side the <span class="c1">Positive resting on itself</span> and on the other side the <span class="c1">Negative</span> resting on itself.

Something which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself—intrinsically—has something outside itself which it lacks. That is, its being is something other than it itself.
