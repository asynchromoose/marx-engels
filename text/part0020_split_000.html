This did not signify any change of interests or outlook but was the logical outgrowth of the position taken in his earlier writings. If the thesis on “alienated labor” was to be made scientifically cogent and if the expectation of coming proletarian revolution was to be based upon it, he needed to show the capital-labor relationship, which he took to be the core of the bourgeois socio-economic system, to be dialectically self-destructive, i.e., transitory by virtue of its inner dynamics of development. The first work in which he attempted this analysis was <span class="c1">Wage Labour and Capital</span>.</p><p class="s8">Having first presented it in lectures to a German workers’ society in Brussels in December, 1847, Marx printed the work in April, 1849, in the <span class="c1">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</span>, of which he was editor-in-chief. Several pamphlet editions appeared in later years. In editing it for the German edition of 1891 (the version that appears here), Engels made some changes in the text, mainly centering in the substitution of the phrase “labour power” for the term “labour” in contexts in which Marx had originally spoken of the worker’s sale of his labour to the capitalist. This, as Engels explained in his preface to the 1891 edition, brought the reasoning of the pamphlet into line with the analysis of the capital-labor relationship as Marx had refined it by 1859, when he published <span class="c1">A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.</span></p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">Despite this, it may be said that what Marx produced in the lectures of late 1847 was the future argument of <span class="c1">Capital</span> in embryo. The work appears here in condensed form.</p>
