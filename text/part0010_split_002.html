<p class="s30">Sovereignty</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">So in this case sovereignty, the essential feature of the state, is treated to begin with as an independent entity, is objectified. Then, of course, this objective entity has to become a subject again. This subject then appears, however, as a self-incarnation of sovereignty; whereas sovereignty is nothing but the objectified mind of the subjects of the state.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">As if the actual state were not the people. The state is an abstraction. The people alone is what is concrete. And it is remarkable that Hegel, who without hesitation attributes a living quality such as sovereignty to the abstraction, attributes it only with hesitation and reservations to something concrete. “The usual sense, however, in which men have recently begun to speak of the sovereignty of the people is in <span class="c1">opposition to the sovereignty existing in the monarch</span>. In this antithesis the sovereignty of the people is one of those confused notions which are rooted in the <span class="c1">wild</span> idea of the <span class="c1">people</span>.”</p><p class="s8">The “confused notions” and the “<span class="c1">wild</span> idea” are here exclusively Hegel’s. To be sure, if sovereignty exists in the monarch, then it is foolish to speak of an antithetical sovereignty in the people; for it is implied in the concept of sovereignty that sovereignty cannot have a double existence, still less one which is contradictory. However:</p><p class="s8">1) This is just the question: Is not that sovereignty which is claimed by the monarch an illusion? Sovereignty of the monarch or sovereignty of the people—that is the question. </p><p class="s8">2) One can also speak of a sovereignty of the people <span class="c1">in opposition to the sovereignty existing in the monarch</span>. But then it is not a question of <span class="c1">one and the same sovereignty</span> which has arisen on two sides, but <span class="c1">two entirely contradictory concepts of sovereignty</span>, the one a sovereignty such as can come to exist in a <span class="c1">monarch</span>, the other such as can come to exist only in a <span class="c1">people</span>. It is the same with the question: “Is God sovereign, or is man?” One of the two is an untruth, even if an existing untruth. </p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_4">“Taken <span class="c1">without</span> its monarch and the <span class="c1">articulation</span> of the whole which is necessarily and directly <span class="c1">associated with the monarch</span>, the people is that formless mass which is no longer a state. It no longer possesses <span class="c1">any</span> of the attributes which are to be found only in an <span class="c1">internally organised</span> whole—sovereignty, government, courts of law, the administration, estates of the realm, etc. With the appearance in a nation of such factors, which relate to organisation, to the life of the state, a people ceases to be that indeterminate abstraction, which, as a purely general notion, is called the nation.” All this is a tautology. If a people has a monarch and the structure that necessarily and directly goes with a monarch, i.e., if it is structured as a monarchy, then indeed, taken out of this structure, it is a formless mass and a purely general notion. “If by sovereignty of the people is understood a <span class="c1">republican</span> form of government and, more specifically, democracy… then… there can be no further discussion of such a notion in face of the developed idea.” That is indeed right, if one has only “such a notion” and not a “developed idea” of democracy.</p>
