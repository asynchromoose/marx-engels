In this early article, printed in the <span class="c1">Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</span> in 1844 in the form of a letter to Arnold Ruge, Marx elaborated the idea of criticism into a program of this journal, of which he and Ruge were editors. His future strictures on utopian socialist plans, in the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> and other later writings, were prefigured in the dismissal here of the communist utopias of writers like Etienne Cabet as a “dogmatic abstraction.” The <span class="c1">Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</span> (<span class="c1">German-French Annals</span>) came out in Paris in February, 1844, in the German language. Only one double issue of the journal was published.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The translation was made by Dr. Ronald Rogowski for this edition.</p>
