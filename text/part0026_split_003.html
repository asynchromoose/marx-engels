<p class="s33">Crisis, Which Was a Contingency, Becomes a Certainty. </p><p class="s33">The Crisis as the Manifestation of All the Contradictions</p><p class="s33">of Bourgeois Economy.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Now before we proceed further, the following must be said: </p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">possibility</span> of crisis, which became apparent in the <span class="c1">simple metamorphosis</span> of the commodity, is once more demonstrated, and further developed, by the disjunction between the (direct) process of production and the process of circulation. As soon as these processes do not merge smoothly into one another but become independent of one another, the crisis is there. </p><p class="s8">The possibility of crisis is indicated in the metamorphosis of the commodity like this: </p><p class="s8">Firstly, the commodity which actually exists as use-value, and nominally, in its price, as exchange-value, must be transformed into money. C—M. If this difficulty, the sale, is solved then the purchase, M—C, presents no difficulty, since money is directly exchangeable for everything else. The use-value of the commodity, the usefulness of the labour contained in it, must be assumed from the start, otherwise it is no commodity at all. It is further assumed that the individual value of the commodity is equal to its social value, that is to say, that the labour-time materialised in it is equal to the socially <span class="c1">necessary</span> labour-time for the production of this commodity. The possibility of a crisis, in so far as it shows itself in the simple form of metamorphosis, thus only arises from the fact that the differences in form—the phases—which it passes through in the course of its progress, are in the first place necessarily complementary and secondly, despite this intrinsic and necessary correlation, they are distinct parts and forms of the process, independent of each other, diverging in time and space, separable and separated from each other. The possibility of crisis therefore lies solely in the separation of sale from purchase. It is thus only in the form of commodity that the commodity has to pass through this difficulty here. As soon as it assumes the form of money it has got over this difficulty. Subsequently however this too resolves into the separation of sale and purchase. If the commodity could not be withdrawn from circulation in the form of money or its retransformation into commodity could not be postponed—as with direct barter—if purchase and sale coincided, then the <span class="c1">possibility</span> of crisis would, under the assumptions made, disappear. For it is assumed that the commodity represents <span class="c1">use-value</span> for other owners of commodities. In the form of direct barter, the commodity is not exchangeable only if it has no use-value or when there are no other use-values on the other side which can be exchanged for it; therefore, only under these two conditions: either if one side has produced <span class="c1">useless</span> things or if the other side has nothing <span class="c1">useful</span> to exchange as an equivalent for the first use-value. In both cases, however, no exchange whatsoever would take place. <span class="c1">But in so far as exchange did take place</span>, its phases would not be separated. The buyer would be seller and the seller buyer. The <span class="c1">critical</span> stage, which arises from the form of the exchange—in so far as it is circulation—would therefore cease to exist, and if we say that the simple form of metamorphosis comprises the possibility of crisis, we only say that in this form itself lies the possibility of the rupture and separation of essentially complimentary phases.</p><p class="s8">But this applies also to the content. In direct barter, the bulk of production is intended by the producer to satisfy his own needs, or, where the division of labour is more developed, to satisfy the needs of his fellow producers, needs that are known to him. What is exchanged as a commodity is the surplus and it is unimportant whether this surplus is exchanged or not. In <span class="c1">commodity production</span> the conversion of the product into money, the sale, is a <span class="c1">conditio sine qua non</span>. Direct production for personal needs does not take place. Crisis results from the impossibility to sell. The difficulty of transforming the <span class="c1">commodity</span>—the particular product of individual labour—into its opposite, money, i.e., abstract general social labour, lies in the fact that <span class="c1">money</span> is not the particular product of individual labour, and that the person who has effected a sale, who therefore has commodities in the form of money, is not compelled to buy again at once, to transform the money again into a particular product of individual labour. In barter this contradiction does not exist: no one can be a seller without being a buyer or a buyer without being a seller. The difficulty of the seller—on the assumption that his commodity has use-value—only stems from the ease with which the buyer can defer the retransformation of money into commodity. The difficulty of converting the commodity into money, of selling it, only arises from the fact that the commodity must be turned into money but the money need not be immediately turned into commodity, and therefore <span class="c1">sale</span> and <span class="c1">purchase</span> can be separated. We have said that this <span class="c1">form</span> contains the <span class="c1">possibility of crisis</span>, that is to say, the possibility that elements which are correlated, which are inseparable, are separated and consequently are forcibly reunited, their coherence is violently asserted against their mutual independence. <span class="c1">Crisis</span> is nothing but the forcible assertion of the unity of phases of the production process which have become independent of each other.</p><p class="s8">The general, abstract possibility of crisis denotes no more than the <span class="c1">most abstract form</span> of crisis, without content, without a compelling motivating factor. Sale and purchase may fall apart. They thus represent potential <span class="c1">crisis</span> and their coincidence always remains a critical factor for the commodity. The transition from one to the other may, however, proceed smoothly. The <span class="c1">most abstract form of crisis</span> (and therefore the formal possibility of crisis) is thus the <span class="c1">metamorphosis of the commodity</span> itself; the contradiction of exchange-value and use-value, and furthermore of money and commodity, comprised within the unity of the commodity, exists in metamorphosis only as an involved movement. The factors which turn this possibility of crisis into [an actual] crisis are not contained in this form itself; it only implies that <span class="c1">the framework</span> for a crisis exists.</p><p class="s8">And in a consideration of the bourgeois economy, that is the important thing. The world trade crises must be regarded as the real concentration and forcible adjustment of all the contradictions of bourgeois economy. The individual factors, which are condensed in these crises, must therefore emerge and must be described in each sphere of the bourgeois economy, and the further we advance in our examination of the latter, the more aspects of this conflict must be traced on the one hand, and on the other hand it must be shown that its more abstract forms are recurring and are contained in the more concrete forms.</p><p class="s8">It can therefore be said that the crisis in its first form is the metamorphosis of the commodity itself, the falling asunder of purchase and sale.</p><p class="s8">The crisis in its second form is the function of money as a means of payment, in which money has two different functions and figures in two different phases, divided from each other in time. Both these forms are as yet quite abstract, although the second is more concrete than the first. </p><p class="s8">To begin with therefore, in considering the <span class="c1">reproduction process</span> of capital (which coincides with its circulation) it is necessary to prove that the above forms are simply repeated, or rather, that only here they receive a content, a basis on which to manifest themselves.</p><p class="s8"> Let us look at the movement of capital from the moment in which it leaves the production process as a commodity in order once again to emerge from it as a commodity. If we abstract here from all the other factors determining its content, then the total commodity capital and each individual commodity of which it is made up, must go through the process C—M—C, the metamorphosis of the commodity. The general possibility of crisis, which is contained in this form—the falling apart of purchase and sale—is thus contained in the movement of capital, in so far as the latter is <span class="c1">also</span> commodity and nothing but commodity. From the interconnection of the metamorphoses of commodities it follows, moreover, that one commodity is transformed into money because another is retransformed from the form of money into commodity. Furthermore, the separation of purchase and sale appears here in such a way that the transformation of one capital from the form commodity into the form money, must correspond to the retransformation of the other capital from the form money into the form commodity. The first metamorphosis of one capital must correspond to the second metamorphosis of the other; one capital leaves the production process as the other capital returns into the production process. This intertwining and coalescence of the processes of reproduction or circulation of different capitals is on the one hand necessitated by the division of labour, on the other hand it is accidental; and thus the definition of the content of crisis is already fuller.</p><p class="s8">Secondly, however, with regard to the possibility of crisis arising from the form of money as <span class="c1">means of payment</span>, it appears that capital may provide a much more concrete basis for turning this possibility into reality. For example, the weaver must pay for the whole of the constant capital whose elements have been produced by the spinner, the flax-grower, the machine-builder, the iron and timber manufacturer, the producer of coal, etc. In so far as these latter produce constant capital that only enters into the production of constant capital, without entering into the cloth, the final commodity; they replace each other’s means of production through the exchange of capital. Supposing the weaver now sells the cloth for £1,000 to the <span class="c1">merchant</span> but in return for a bill of exchange so that money figures as <span class="c1">means of payment</span>. The weaver for his part hands over the bill of exchange to the <span class="c1">banker</span>, to whom he may thus be repaying a debt or, on the other hand, the banker may negotiate the bill for him. The flax-grower has sold to the spinner in return for a bill of exchange, the spinner to the weaver, ditto the machine manufacturer to the weaver, ditto the iron and timber manufacturer to the machine manufacturer, ditto the coal producer to the spinner, weaver, machine manufacturer, iron and timber supplier. Besides, the iron, coal, timber and flax producers have paid one another with bills of exchange. Now if the merchant does not pay, then the weaver cannot pay his bill of exchange to the banker. </p><p class="s8">The flax-grower has drawn on the spinner, the machine manufacturer on the weaver and the spinner. The spinner cannot pay because the weaver cannot pay, neither of them pay the machine manufacturer, and the latter does not pay the iron, timber or coal supplier. And all of these in turn, as they cannot realise the value of their commodities, cannot replace that portion of value which is to replace their constant capital. Thus the general crisis comes into being. This is nothing other than the <span class="c1">possibility of crisis</span> described when dealing with money as a means of payment; but here—in capitalist production—we can already see the connection between the mutual claims and obligations, the sales and purchases, through which the possibility can develop into actuality.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">In any case:</span> If purchase and sale do not get bogged down, and therefore do not require forcible adjustment—and, on the other hand, money as means of payment functions in such a way that claims are mutually settled, and thus the contradiction inherent in money as a means of payment is not realised—if therefore neither of these two abstract forms of crisis become real, no crisis exists. No crisis can exist unless sale and purchase are separated from one another and come into conflict, or the contradictions contained in money as a means of payment actually come into play; crisis, therefore, cannot exist without manifesting itself at the same time in its simple form, as the contradiction between sale and purchase and the contradiction of money as a means of payment. But these are merely <span class="c1">forms</span>, general possibilities of crisis, and hence also forms, abstract forms, of actual crisis. In them, the nature of crisis appears in its simplest forms, and, in so far as this form is itself the simplest content of crisis, in its simplest content. But the content is not yet <span class="c1">substantiated.</span> Simple circulation of money and even the circulation of money as a means of payment—and both come into being long <span class="c1">before</span> capitalist production, while there are no crises—are possible and actually take place without crises. These forms alone, therefore, do not explain why their crucial aspect becomes prominent and why the potential contradiction contained in them becomes a real contradiction.</p><p class="s8">This shows how insipid the economists are who, when they are no longer able to explain away the phenomenon of over-production and crises, are content to say that these forms contain the possibility of <span class="c1">crises</span>, that it is therefore <span class="c1">accidental </span>whether or not crises occur and consequently their occurrence is itself merely a <span class="c1">matter of chance</span>.</p><p class="s8">The contradictions inherent in the circulation of commodities, which are further developed in the circulation of money—and thus, also, the possibilities of crisis—reproduce themselves, automatically, in capital, since developed circulation of commodities and of money, in fact, only take place on the basis of capital.</p><p class="s8">But now the further development of the potential crisis has to be traced—the real crisis can only be educed from the real movement of capitalist production, competition and credit—in so far as crisis arises out of the special aspects of capital which are <span class="c1">peculiar</span> to it as capital, and not merely comprised in its existence as commodity and money.</p><p class="s8">The mere (direct) <span class="c1">production process</span> of capital in itself, cannot add anything new in this context. In order to exist at all, its conditions are presupposed. The first section dealing with capital—the <span class="c1">direct</span> process of production—does not contribute any new element of crisis. Although it <span class="c1">does</span> contain such an element, because the production process implies appropriation and hence production of surplus-value. But this cannot be shown when dealing with the production process itself, for the latter is not concerned with the <span class="c1">realisation</span> either of the reproduced value or of the surplus-value.</p><p class="s8">This can only emerge in the <span class="c1">circulation process</span> which is in itself also a <span class="c1">process of reproduction</span>.</p><p class="s8">Furthermore it is necessary to describe the circulation or reproduction process before dealing with the already existing capital—<span class="c1">capital and profit</span>—since we have to explain, not only how capital produces, but also how capital is produced. But the actual movement starts from the existing capital—i.e., the actual movement denotes developed capitalist production, which starts from and presupposes it own basis. The process of reproduction and the predisposition to crisis which is further developed in it, are therefore only partially described under this heading and require further elaboration in the chapter on <span class="c1">“Capital and Profit.”</span></p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_6">The circulation process as a whole or the reproduction process of capital as a whole is the unity of its production phase and its circulation phase, so that it comprises both these processes or phases. Therein lies a further developed possibility or abstract form of crisis. The economists who deny crises consequently assert only the unity of these two phases. If they were only separate, without being a unity, then their unity could not be established by force and there could be no crisis. If they were only a unity without being separate, then no violent separation would be possible implying a crisis. Crisis is the forcible establishment of unity between elements that have become independent and the enforced separation from one another of elements which are essentially one.</p>
