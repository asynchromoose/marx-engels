<p class="s30">Bureaucracy</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The “state formalism” which bureaucracy is, is the “state as formalism”; and it is as a formalism of this kind that Hegel has described bureaucracy. Since this “state formalism” constitutes itself as an actual power and itself becomes its own <span class="c1">material </span>content, it goes without saying that the “bureaucracy” is a web of <span class="c1">practical</span> illusions, or the “illusion of the state.” The bureaucratic spirit is a jesuitical, theological spirit through and through. The bureaucrats are the jesuits and theologians of the state. The bureaucracy is <span class="c1">la république prêtre</span>.</p><p class="s8">Since by its <span class="c1">very nature</span> the bureaucracy is the “state as formalism,” it is this also as regards its <span class="c1">purpose</span>. The actual purpose of the state therefore appears to the bureaucracy as an objective <span class="c1">hostile</span> to the state. The spirit of the bureaucracy is the “formal state spirit.” The bureaucracy therefore turns the “formal state spirit” or the <span class="c1">actual</span> spiritlessness of the state into categorical imperative. The bureaucracy takes itself to be the ultimate purpose of the state. Because the bureaucracy turns its “formal” objectives into its content, it comes into conflict everywhere with “real” objectives. It is therefore obliged to pass off the form for the content and the content for the form. State objectives are transformed into objectives of the department, and department objectives into objectives of the state. The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a <span class="c1">hierarchy of knowledge</span>. The top entrusts the understanding of detail to the lower levels, whilst the lower levels credit the top with understanding of the general, and so all are mutually deceived.</p><p class="s8">The bureaucracy is the imaginary state alongside the real state—the spiritualism of the state. Each thing has therefore a double meaning, a real and a bureaucratic meaning, just as knowledge (and also the will) is both real and bureaucratic. The really existing, however, is treated in the light of its bureaucratic nature, its otherworldly, spiritual essence. The bureaucracy has the state, the spiritual essence of society, in its possession, as its <span class="c1">private property</span>. The general spirit of the bureaucracy is the <span class="c1">secret</span>, the mystery, preserved within itself by the hierarchy and against the outside world by being a closed corporation. Avowed political spirit, as also political mindedness, therefore appear to the bureaucracy as treason against its mystery. Hence, <span class="c1">authority</span> is the basis of its knowledge, and the deification of authority is its <span class="c1">conviction</span>. Within the bureaucracy itself, however, <span class="c1">spiritualism</span> becomes <span class="c1">crass materialism</span>, the materialism of passive obedience, of faith in authority, of the <span class="c1">mechanism</span> of fixed and formalistic behaviour, and of fixed principles, views and traditions. In the case of the individual bureaucrat, the state objective turns into his private objective, into a <span class="c1">chasing after higher posts</span>, the <span class="c1">making of a career</span>. In the first place, he looks on actual life as something <span class="c1">material</span>, for the <span class="c1">spirit of this life has its distinctly separate existence</span> in the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy must therefore proceed to make life as material as possible. Secondly, actual life is material for the bureaucrat himself, i.e., so far as it becomes an object of bureaucratic manipulation; for his spirit is prescribed for him, his aim lies beyond him and his existence is the existence of the department. The state only continues to exist as various fixed bureaucratic minds, bound together in subordination and passive obedience. <span class="c1">Actual</span> knowledge seems devoid of content, just as actual life seems dead; for this imaginary knowledge and this imaginary life are taken for the real thing. The bureaucrat must therefore deal with the actual state jesuitically, whether this jesuitry is conscious or unconscious. However, once its antithesis is knowledge, this jesuitry is likewise bound to achieve self-consciousness and then become deliberate jesuitry. </p><p class="s8">Whilst the bureaucracy is on the one hand this crass materialism, it manifests its crass spiritualism in the fact that it wants to <span class="c1">do everything</span>, i.e., by making the <span class="c1">will</span> the <span class="c1">causa prima</span>. For it is purely an <span class="c1">active</span> form of existence and receives its content from without and can prove its existence, therefore, only by shaping and restricting this content. For the bureaucrat the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.</p><p class="s8">When Hegel calls the executive the <span class="c1">objective</span> aspect of the sovereignty dwelling in the monarch, that is right in the same sense in which the Catholic Church was the <span class="c1">real presence</span> of the sovereignty, substance and spirit of the Holy Trinity. In the bureaucracy the identity of state interest and particular private aim is established in such a way that the <span class="c1">state interest</span> becomes a <span class="c1">particular</span> private aim over against other private aims. </p><p class="s8">The abolition of the bureaucracy is only possible by the general interest <span class="c1">actually</span>—and not, as with Hegel, merely in thought, in <span class="c1">abstraction</span>—becoming the particular interest, which in turn is only possible as a result of the <span class="c1">particular</span> actually becoming the <span class="c1">general</span> interest. Hegel starts from an unreal antithesis and therefore achieves only an imaginary identity which is in truth again a contradictory identity. The bureaucracy is just such an identity.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s25" id="calibre_pb_10">* * *</p>
