<p class="s20">I</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">1. “Labour is the source of all wealth and all culture, and <span class="c1">since </span>useful labour is possible only in society and through society, the proceeds of labour belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First Part of the Paragraph:</span> “Labour is the source of all wealth and all culture.”</p><p class="s8">Labour is <span class="c1">not the source of</span> all wealth. <span class="c1">Nature</span> is just as much the source of use values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labour, which itself is only the manifestation of a force of nature, human labour power. The above phrase is to be found in all children’s primers and is correct in so far as it is <span class="c1">implied</span> that labour is performed with the appurtenant subjects and instruments. But a socialist programme cannot allow such bourgeois phrases to pass over in silence the <span class="c1">conditions</span> that alone give them meaning. And in so far as man from the beginning behaves towards nature, the primary source of all instruments and subjects of labour, as an owner, treats her as belonging to him, his labour becomes the source of use values, therefore also of wealth. The bourgeois have very good grounds for falsely ascribing <span class="c1">supernatural creative power</span> to labour; since precisely from the fact that labour depends on nature it follows that the man who posseses no other property than his labour power must, in all conditions of society and culture, be the slave of other men who have made themselves the owners of the material conditions of labour. He can work only with their permission, hence live only with their permission.</p><p class="s8">Let us now leave the sentence as it stands, or rather limps. What would one have expected in conclusion? Obviously this:</p><p class="s8">“Since labour is the source of all wealth, no one in society can appropriate wealth except as the product of labour. Therefore, if he himself does not work, he lives by the labour of others and also acquires his culture at the expense of the labour of others.”</p><p class="s8">Instead of this, by means of the verbal rivet <span class="c1">“and since”</span> a second proposition is added in order to draw a conclusion from this and not from the first one.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Second Part of the Paragraph:</span> “Useful labour is possible only in society and through society.”</p><p class="s8">According to the first proposition, labour was the source of all wealth and all culture; therefore no society is possible without labour. Now we learn, conversely, that no “useful” labour is possible without society.</p><p class="s8">One could just as well have said that only in society can useless and even socially harmful labour become a branch of gainful occupation, that only in society can one live by being idle, etc., etc.—in short, one could just as well have copied the whole of Rousseau.</p><p class="s8">And what is “useful” labour? Surely only labour which produces the intended useful result. A savage—and man was a savage after he had ceased to be an ape—who kills an animal with a stone, who collects fruits, etc., performs “useful” labour.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Thirdly. The Conclusion:</span> “And since useful labour is possible only in society and through society, the proceeds of labour belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society.”</p><p class="s8">A fine conclusion! If useful labour is possible only in society and through society, the proceeds of labour belong to society—and only so much therefrom accrues to the individual worker as is not required to maintain the “condition” of labour, society.</p><p class="s8">In fact, this proposition has at all times been made use of by the champions of the <span class="c1">state of society prevailing at any given time.</span> First come the claims of the government and everything that sticks to it, since it is the social organ for the maintenance of the social order; then come the claims of the various kinds of private property, for the various kinds of private property are the foundations of society, etc. One sees that such hollow phrases can be twisted and turned as desired.</p><p class="s8">The first and second parts of the paragraph have some intelligible connection only in the following wording:</p><p class="s8">“Labour becomes the source of wealth and culture only as social labour,” or, what is the same thing, “in and through society.”</p><p class="s8">This proposition is incontestably correct, for although isolated labour (its material conditions presupposed) can create use values, it can create neither wealth nor culture.</p><p class="s8">But equally incontestable is this other proposition: </p><p class="s8">“In proportion as labour develops socially, and becomes thereby a source of wealth and culture, poverty and destitution develop among the workers, and wealth and culture among the non-workers.”</p><p class="s8">This is the law of all history hitherto. What, therefore, had to be done here, instead of setting down general phrases about “labour” and “society,” was to prove concretely how in present capitalist society the material, etc., conditions have at last been created which enable and compel the workers to lift this social curse.</p><p class="s8">In fact, however, the whole paragraph, bungled in style and content, is only there in order to inscribe the Lassallean catchword of the “undiminished proceeds of labour” as a slogan at the top of the party banner. I shall return later to the “proceeds of labour,” “equal right,” etc., since the same thing recurs in a somewhat different form further on.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">2. “In present-day society, the instruments of labour are the monopoly of the capitalist class; the resulting dependence of the working class is the cause of misery and servitude in all its forms.” </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">This sentence, borrowed from the Rules of the International, is incorrect in this “improved” edition.</p><p class="s8">In present-day society the instruments of labour are the monopoly of the landowners (the monopoly of property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital) <span class="c1">and</span> the capitalists. In the passage in question, the Rules of the International do not mention either the one or the other class of monopolists. They speak of the <span class="c1">“monopoliser of the means of labour</span>, that is, <span class="c1">the sources of life.”</span> The addition, <span class="c1">“sources of life,”</span> makes it sufficiently clear that land is included in the instruments of labour. </p><p class="s8">The correction was introduced because Lassalle, for reasons now generally known, attacked <span class="c1">only</span> the capitalist class and not the landowners. In England, the capitalist is usually not even the owner of the land on which his factory stands.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">3. “The emancipation of labour demands the promotion of the instruments of labour to the common property of society and the co-operative regulation of the total labour with a fair distribution of the proceeds of labour.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">“Promotion of the instruments of labour to the common property” ought obviously to read their “conversion into the common property”; but this only in passing.</p><p class="s8">What are “proceeds of labour”? The product of labour or its value? And in the latter case, is it the total value of the product or only that part of the value which labour has newly added to the value of the means of production consumed? </p><p class="s8">“Proceeds of labour” is a loose notion which Lassalle has put in the place of definite economic conceptions.</p><p class="s8">What is “a fair distribution”?</p><p class="s8">Do not the bourgeois assert that the present-day distribution is “fair”? And is it not, in fact, the only “fair” distribution on the basis of the present-day mode of production? Are economic relations regulated by legal conceptions or do not, on the contrary, legal relations arise from economic ones? Have not also the socialist sectarians the most varied notions about “fair” distribution?</p><p class="s8">To understand what is implied in this connection by the phrase “fair distribution,” we must take the first paragraph and this one together. The latter presupposes a society wherein “the instruments of labour are common property and the total labour is cooperatively regulated,” and from the first paragraph we learn that “the proceeds of labour belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society.”</p><p class="s8">“To all members of society”? To those who do not work as well? What remains then of the “undiminished proceeds of labour”? Only to those members of society who work? What remains then of the “equal right” of all members of society?</p><p class="s8">But “all members of society” and “equal right” are obviously mere phrases. The kernel consists in this, that in this communist society every worker must receive the “undiminished” Lassallean “proceeds of labour.”</p><p class="s8">Let us take first of all the words “proceeds of labour” in the sense of the product of labour; then the co-operative proceeds of labour are the <span class="c1">total social product.</span></p><p class="s8">From this must now be deducted:</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First,</span> cover for replacement of the means of production used up.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Secondly,</span> additional portion for expansion of production.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Thirdly,</span> reserve or insurance funds to provide against accidents, dislocations caused by natural calamities, etc.</p><p class="s8">These deductions from the “undiminished proceeds of labour” are an economic necessity and their magnitude is to be determined according to available means and forces, and partly by computation of probabilities, but they are in no way calculable by equity.</p><p class="s8">There remains the other part of the total product, intended to serve as means of consumption.</p><p class="s8">Before this is divided among the individuals, there has to be deducted again, from it:</p><p class="s34">First, the general costs of administration not belonging to production.</p><p class="s8">This part will, from the outset, be very considerably restricted in comparison with present-day society and it diminishes in proportion as the new society develops.</p><p class="s34">Secondly, that which is intended for the common satisfaction of needs,<span class="c7"> such as schools, health services, etc. </span></p><p class="s8">From the outset this part grows considerably in comparison with present-day society and it grows in proportion as the new society develops. </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Thirdly, funds for those unable to work,</span> etc., in short, for what is included under so-called official poor relief today.</p><p class="s8">Only now do we come to the “distribution” which the programme, under Lassallean influence, alone has in view in its narrow fashion, namely, to that part of the means of consumption which is divided among the individual producers of the co-operative society.</p><p class="s8">The “undiminished proceeds of labour” have already unnoticeably become converted into the “diminished” proceeds, although what the producer is deprived of in his capacity as a private individual benefits him directly or indirectly in his capacity as a member of society.</p><p class="s8">Just as the phrase of the “undiminished proceeds of labour” has disappeared, so now does the phrase of the “proceeds of labour” disappear altogether.</p><p class="s8">Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producer do not exchange their products; just as little does the labour employed on the products appear here <span class="c1">as the value</span> of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labour no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of the total labour. The phrase “proceeds of labour,” objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all meaning.</p><p class="s8">What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has <span class="c1">developed</span> on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it <span class="c1">emerges </span>from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally and intellectually, still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society—after the deductions have been made—exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labour. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labour time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such and such an amount of labour (after deducting his labour for the common funds), and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour. The same amount of labour which he has given to society in one form he receives back in another.</p><p class="s8">Here obviously the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labour, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals except individual means of consumption. But, as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labour in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labour in another form.</p><p class="s8">Hence, <span class="c1">equal right</span> here is still in principle—<span class="c1">bourgeois right</span>, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange only exists on the <span class="c1">average</span> and not in the individual case.</p><p class="s8">In spite of this advance, this <span class="c1">equal right</span> is still constantly stigmatised by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is <span class="c1">proportional</span> to the labour they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an <span class="c1">equal standard</span>, labour.</p><p class="s8">But one man is superior to another physically or mentally and so supplies more labour in the same time, or can labour for a longer time; and labour, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This <span class="c1">equal </span>right is an unequal right for unequal labour. It recognises no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognises unequal individual endowment and thus productive capacity as natural privileges. <span class="c1">It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right.</span> Right by its very nature can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard in so far as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one <span class="c1">definite</span> side only, for instance, in the present case, are regarded <span class="c1">only as workers</span> and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labour, and hence an equal share in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right instead of being equal would have to be unequal. </p><p class="s8">But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.</p><p class="s8">In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labour, has vanished; after labour has become not only a means of life but life’s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banner: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!</p><p class="s8">I have dealt more at length with the “undiminished proceeds of labour,” on the one hand, and with “equal right” and “fair distribution,” on the other, in order to show what a crime it is to attempt, on the one hand, to force on our Party again, as dogmas, ideas which in a certain period had some meaning but have now become obsolete verbal rubbish, while again perverting, on the other, the realistic outlook, which it cost so much effort to instil into the Party but which has now taken root in it, by means of ideological nonsense about right and other trash so common among the democrats and French Socialists.</p><p class="s8">Quite apart from the analysis so far given, it was in general a mistake to make a fuss about so-called <span class="c1">distribution</span> and put the principal stress on it.</p><p class="s8">Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves. The latter distribution, however, is a feature of the mode of production itself. The capitalist mode of production, for example, rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of non-workers in the form of property in capital and land, while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production, of labour power. If the elements of production are so distributed, then the present-day distribution of the means of consumption results automatically. If the material conditions of production are the co-operative property of the workers themselves, then there likewise results a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present one. Vulgar socialism (and from it in turn a section of the democracy) has taken over from the bourgeois economists the consideration and treatment of distribution as independent of the mode of production and hence the presentation of socialism as turning principally on distribution. After the real relation has long been made clear, why retrogress again?</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">4. “The emancipation of labour must be the work of the working class, relatively to which all other classes are <span class="c1">only one reactionary mass.”</span></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The first strophe is taken from the introductory words of the Rules of the International, but “improved.” There it is said: “The emancipation of the working class must be the act of the workers themselves”; here, on the contrary, the “working class” has to emancipate—what? “Labour.” Let him understand who can.</p><p class="s8">In compensation, the antistrophe, on the other hand, is a Lassallean quotation of the first water: “relatively to which (the working class) all other classes are <span class="c1">only one reactionary mass.”</span></p><p class="s8">In the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> it is said: “Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a <span class="c1">really revolutionary class.</span> The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.” </p><p class="s8">The bourgeoisie is here conceived as a revolutionary class—as the bearer of large-scale industry—relatively to the feudal lords and the lower middle class, who desire to maintain all social positions that are the creation of obsolete modes of production. Thus they do not form <span class="c1">together</span> with the <span class="c1">bourgeoisie</span> only one reactionary mass.</p><p class="s8">On the other hand, the proletariat is revolutionary relatively to the bourgeoisie because, having itself grown up on the basis of large-scale industry, it strives to strip off from production the capitalist character that the bourgeoisie seeks to perpetuate. But the <span class="c1">Manifesto</span> adds that the “lower middle class” is becoming revolutionary “in view of [its] impending transfer into the proletariat.” </p><p class="s8">From this point of view, therefore, it is again nonsense to say that it, together with the bourgeoisie, and with the feudal lords into the bargain, “form only one reactionary mass” relatively to the working class.</p><p class="s8">Has one proclaimed to the artisans, small manufacturers, etc., and <span class="c1">peasants</span> during the last elections: Relatively to us you, together with the bourgeoisie and feudal lords, form only one reactionary mass?</p><p class="s8">Lassalle knew the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> by heart, as his faithful followers know the gospels written by him. If, therefore, he has falsified it so grossly, this has occurred only to put a good colour on his alliance with absolutist and feudal opponents against the bourgeoisie.</p><p class="s8">In the above paragraph, moreover, his oracular saying is dragged in by main force without any connection with the botched quotation from the Rules of the International. Thus is it here simply an impertinence, and indeed not at all displeasing to Herr Bismarck, one of those cheap pieces of insolence in which the Marat of Berlin<a id="footnote-ref325" href="part0057.html#footnote325" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">325</sup></span></a> deals.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">5. “The working class strives for its emancipation first of all <span class="c1">within the framework of the present-day national state,</span> conscious that the necessary result of its efforts, which are common to the workers of all civilised countries, will be the international brotherhood of peoples.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Lassalle, in opposition to the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> and to all earlier socialism, conceived the workers’ movement from the narrowest national standpoint. He is being followed in this—and that after the work of the International!</p><p class="s8">It is altogether self-evident that, to be able to fight at all, the working class must organise itself at home <span class="c1">as a class</span> and that its own country is the immediate arena of its struggle. In so far its class struggle is national, not in substance, but, as the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> says, “in form.” But the “framework of the present-day national state,” for instance, the German Empire, is itself in its turn economically “within the framework” of the world market, politically “within the framework” of the system of states. Every businessman knows that German trade is at the same time foreign trade, and the greatness of Herr Bismarck consists, to be sure, precisely in his pursuing a kind of <span class="c1">international</span> policy.</p><p class="s8">And to what does the German workers’ party reduce its internationalism? To the consciousness that the result of its efforts will be <span class="c1">“the international brotherhood of peoples”</span>—a phrase borrowed from the bourgeois League of Peace and Freedom<a id="footnote-ref326" href="part0057.html#footnote326" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">326</sup></span></a> which is intended to pass as equivalent to the international brotherhood of the working classes in the joint struggle against the ruling classes and their governments. Not a word, therefore, <span class="c1">about the international functions</span> of the German working class! And it is thus that it is to challenge its own bourgeoisie—which is already linked up in brotherhood against it with the bourgeois of all other countries—and Herr Bismarck’s international policy of conspiracy!</p><p class="s8">In fact, the internationalism of the programme stands <span class="c1">even infinitely below</span> that of the Free Trade Party. The latter also asserts that the result of its efforts will be “the international brotherhood of peoples.” But it also <span class="c1">does</span> something to make trade international and by no means contents itself with the consciousness—that all <span class="c1">peoples are carrying on trade at home.</span> </p><p class="s8">The international activity of the working classes does not in any way depend on the existence of the <span class="c1">International Working Men’s Association</span>. This was only the first attempt to create a central organ for that activity; an attempt which was a lasting success on account of the impulse which it gave but which was no longer realisable in its <span class="c1">first historical form</span> after the fall of the Paris Commune.</p><p class="s8">Bismarck’s <span class="c1">Norddeutsche</span> was absolutely right when it announced, to the satisfaction of its master, that the German workers’ party had sworn off internationalism in the new programme.<a id="footnote-ref327" href="part0057.html#footnote327" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">327</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">II</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">“Starting from these basic principles, the German workers’ party strives by all legal means for the <span class="c1">free state—and</span>—socialist society: the abolition of the wage system <span class="c1">together with</span> the <span class="c1">iron law of wages</span>—and—exploitation in every form; the elimination of all social and political inequality.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">I shall return to the “free” state later.</p><p class="s8">So, in future, the German workers’ party has got to believe in Lassalle’s “iron law of wages”! That this may not be lost, the nonsense is perpetrated of speaking of the “abolition of the wage system” (it should read: system of wage labour) <span class="c1">“together with</span> the iron law of wages.” If I abolish wage labour, then naturally I abolish its laws also, whether they are of “iron” or sponge. But Lassalle’s attack on wage labour turns almost solely on this so-called law. In order, therefore, to prove that Lassalle’s sect has conquered, the “wage system” must be abolished <span class="c1">“together with</span> the iron law of wages” and not without it.</p><p class="s8">It is well known that nothing of the “iron law of wages” is Lassalle’s except the word “iron” borrowed from Goethe’s “great eternal iron laws.” The word <span class="c1">iron</span> is a label by which the true believers recognise one another. But if I take the law with Lassalle’s stamp on it and, consequently, in his sense, then I must also take it with his substantiation for it. And what is that? As Lange already showed, shortly after Lassalle’s death, it is the Malthusian theory of population (preached by Lange himself). But if this theory is correct, then again I <span class="c1">cannot</span> abolish the law even if I abolish wage labour a hundred times over, because the law then governs not only the system of wage labour but <span class="c1">every </span>social system. Basing themselves directly on this, the economists have been proving for fifty years and more that socialism cannot abolish poverty, <span class="c1">which has its basis in nature,</span> but can only make it <span class="c1">general</span>, distribute it simultaneously over the whole surface of society!</p><p class="s8">But all this is not the main thing. <span class="c1">Quite apart</span> from the <span class="c1">false</span> Lassallean formulation of the law, the truly outrageous retrogression consists in the following.</p><p class="s8">Since Lassalle’s death there has asserted itself in our Party the scientific understanding that wages are not what they <span class="c1">appear</span> to be, namely, the <span class="c1">value</span>, or <span class="c1">price, of labour</span>, but only a masked form for the <span class="c1">value</span>, or <span class="c1">price, of labour power</span>. Thereby the whole bourgeois conception of wages hitherto, as well as all the criticism hitherto directed against this conception, was thrown overboard once for all and it was made clear that the wage-worker has permission to work for his own subsistence, that is, <span class="c1">to live</span>, only in so far as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist (and hence also for the latter’s co-consumers of surplus value); that the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this gratis labour by extending the working day or by developing the productivity, that is, increasing the intensity of labour power, etc; that, consequently, the system of wage labour is a system of slavery, and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labour develop, whether the worker receives better or worse payment. And after this understanding has gained more and more ground in our Party, one returns to Lassalle’s dogmas, although one must have known that Lassalle <span class="c1">did not know</span> what wages were, but following in the wake of the bourgeois economists took the appearance for the essence of the matter.</p><p class="s8">It is as if, among slaves who have at last got behind the secret of slavery and broken out in rebellion, a slave still in thrall to obsolete notions were to inscribe on the programme of the rebellion: Slavery must be abolished because the feeding of slaves in the system of slavery cannot exceed a certain low maximum!</p><p class="s8">Does not the mere fact that the representatives of our Party were capable of perpetrating such a monstrous attack on the understanding that has spread among the mass of our Party prove by itself with what criminal levity and with what lack of conscience they set to work in drawing up this compromise programme!</p><p class="s8">Instead of the indefinite concluding phrase of the paragraph, “the elimination of all social and political inequality,” it ought to have been said that with the abolition of class distinctions all social and political inequality arising from them would disappear of itself.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">III</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s46"><span class="c7">“The German workers party, in </span>order to pave the way to the solution of the social question<span class="c7">, demands the establishment of producers’ co-operative societies </span>with state aid under the democratic control of the toiling people.<span class="c7"> The producers’ co-operative societies </span>are to be called into being<span class="c7"> for industry and agriculture on such a scale </span>that the socialist organisation of the total labour will arise from them.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">After the Lassallean “iron law of wages,” the physic of the prophet. The way to it is “paved” in worthy fashion. In place of the existing class struggle appears a newspaper scribbler’s phrase: “the social <span class="c1">question,”</span> to the <span class="c1">“solution”</span> of which one “paves the way.” Instead of arising from the revolutionary process of transformation of society, the “socialist organisation of the total labour” “arises” from the “state aid” that the state gives to the producers’ co-operative societies and which the <span class="c1">state</span>, not the worker, <span class="c1">“calls into being.”</span> It is worthy of Lassalle’s imagination that with state loans one can build a new society just as well as a new railway!</p><p class="s8">From the remnants of a sense of shame, “state aid” has been put—under the democratic control of the “toiling people.”</p><p class="s8">In the first place, the majority of the “toiling people” in Germany consists of peasants, and not of proletarians.</p><p class="s8">Secondly, “democratic” means in German <span class="c1">“volksherrschaftlich”</span> [“by the rule of the people”]. But what does “control by the rule of the people of the toiling people” mean? And particularly in the case of a toiling people which, through these demands that it puts to the state, expresses its full consciousness that it neither rules nor is ripe for ruling! </p><p class="s8">It would be superfluous to deal here with the criticism of the recipe prescribed by Buchez in the reign of Louis Philippe in <span class="c1">opposition</span> to the French Socialists and accepted by the reactionary workers of the <span class="c1">Atelier</span>.<a id="footnote-ref328" href="part0057.html#footnote328" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">328</sup></span></a> The chief offence does not lie in having inscribed this specific nostrum in the programme, but in taking, in general, a retrograde step from the standpoint of a class movement to that of a sectarian movement.</p><p class="s8">That the workers desire to establish the conditions for co-operative production on a social scale, and first of all on a national scale in their own country, only means that they are working to revolutionise the present conditions of production, and it has nothing in common with the foundation of co-operative societies with state aid. But as far as the present co-operative societies are concerned, they are of value <span class="c1">only</span> in so far as they are the independent creations of the workers and not protégés either of the government or of the bourgeois.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">IV</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">I come now to the democratic section.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s46"><span class="c7">A. </span>“The free basis of the state.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">First of all, according to II, the German workers’ party strives for “the free state.”</p><p class="s8">Free state—what is this?</p><p class="s8">It is by no means the aim of the workers, who have got rid of the narrow mentality of humble subjects, to set the state free. In the German Empire the “state” is almost as “free” as in Russia. Freedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed upon society into one completely subordinate to it, and today, too, the forms of state are more free or less free to the extent that they restrict the “freedom of the state.”</p><p class="s8">The German workers’ party—at least if it adopts the programme—shows that its socialist ideas are not even skin-deep; in that, instead of treating existing society (and this holds good for any future one) as the <span class="c1">basis</span> of the existing state (or of the future state in the case of future society), it treats the state rather as independent entity that possesses its own <span class="c1">intellectual, ethical and libertarian bases.</span></p><p class="s8">And what of the riotous misuse which the programme makes of the words <span class="c1">“present-day state,” “present-day society,”</span> and of the still more riotous misconception it creates in regard to the state to which it addresses its demands?</p><p class="s8">“Present-day society” is capitalist society, which exists in all civilised countries, more or less free from medieval admixture, more or less modified by the special historical development of each country, more or less developed. On the other hand, the “present-day state” changes with a country’s frontier. It is different in the Prusso-German Empire from what it is in Switzerland, it is different in England from what it is in the United States. The “present-day state” is, therefore, a fiction.</p><p class="s8">Nevertheless, the different states of the different civilised countries, in spite of their manifold diversity of form, all have this in common, that they are based on modern bourgeois society, only one more or less capitalistically developed. They have, therefore, also certain essential features in common. In this sense it is possible to speak of the “present-day state,” in contrast with the future, in which its present root, bourgeois society, will have died off.</p><p class="s8">The question then arises: what transformation will the state undergo in communist society? In other words, what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present functions of the state? This question can only be answered scientifically, and one does not get a flea-hop nearer to the problem by a thousandfold combination of the word people with the word state.</p><p class="s8"> Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. There corresponds to this also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but <span class="c1">the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat</span>. </p><p class="s8">Now the programme does not deal with this nor with the future state of communist society.</p><p class="s8">Its political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic litany familiar to all: universal suffrage, direct legislation, popular rights, a people’s militia, etc. They are a mere echo of the bourgeois People’s Party, of the League of Peace and Freedom. They are all demands which, in so far as they are not exaggerated in fantastic presentation, have already been <span class="c1">realised</span>. Only the state to which they belong does not lie within the borders of the German Empire, but in Switzerland, the United States, etc. This sort of “state of the future” is a present-day state, although existing outside the “framework” of the German Empire.</p><p class="s8">But one thing has been forgotten. Since the German workers’ party expressly declares that it acts within “the present-day national state,” hence within <span class="c1">its own</span> state, the Prusso-German Empire—its demands would indeed otherwise be largely meaningless, since one only demands what one has not got—it should not have forgotten the chief thing, namely, that all those pretty little gewgaws rest on the recognition of the so-called sovereignty of the people and hence are appropriate only in a <span class="c1">democratic republic</span>.</p><p class="s8">Since one has not the courage—and wisely so, for the circumstances demand caution—to demand the democratic republic, as the French workers’ programmes under Louis Philippe and under Louis Napoleon did, one should not have resorted, either, to the subterfuge, neither “honest”<a id="footnote-ref329" href="part0057.html#footnote329" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">329</sup></span></a> nor decent, of demanding things which have meaning only in a democratic republic from a state which is nothing but a police-guarded military despotism, embellished with parliamentary forms, alloyed with a feudal admixture, already influenced by the bourgeoisie and bureaucratically carpentered, and then to assure this state into the bargain that one imagines one will be able to force such things upon it “by legal means.”</p><p class="s8">Even vulgar democracy, which sees the millennium in the democratic republic and has no suspicion that it is precisely in this last form of state of bourgeois society that the class struggle has to be fought out to a conclusion—even it towers mountains above this kind of democratism which keeps within the limits of what is permitted by the police and not permitted by logic.</p><p class="s8">That, in fact, by the word “state” is meant the government machine, or the state in so far as it forms a special organism separated from society through division of labour, is shown by the words “the German worker’s party demands <span class="c1">as the economic basis of the state:</span> a single progressive income tax,” etc. Taxes are the economic basis of the government machinery and of nothing else. In the state of the future, existing in Switzerland, this demand has been pretty well fulfilled. Income tax presupposes various sources of income of the various social classes, and hence capitalist society. It is, therefore, nothing remarkable that the Liverpool financial reformers, bourgeois headed by Gladstone’s brother, are putting forward the same demand as the programme.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">B. “The German workers’ party demands as the intellectual and ethical basis of the state:</p><p class="s47">“1. Universal and <span class="c1">equal elementary education</span> by the state. Universal compulsory school attendance. Free instruction.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Equal elementary education?</span> What idea lies behind these words? Is it believed that in present-day society (and it is only with this one has to deal) education can be <span class="c1">equal</span> for all classes? Or is it demanded that the upper classes also shall be compulsorily reduced to the modicum of education—the elementary school—that alone is compatible with the economic conditions not only of the wage-workers but of the peasants as well?</p><p class="s8">“Universal compulsory school attendance. Free instruction.” The former exists even in Germany, the second in Switzerland and in the United States in the case of elementary schools. If in some states of the latter country higher educational institutions are also “free” that only means in fact defraying the cost of the education of the upper classes from the general tax receipts. Incidentally, the same holds good for “free administration of justice” demanded under A, 5. The administration of criminal justice is to be had free everywhere; that of civil justice is concerned almost exclusively with conflicts over property and hence affects almost exclusively the possessing classes. Are they to carry on their litigation at the expense of the national coffers?</p><p class="s8">The paragraph on the schools should at least have demanded technical schools (theoretical and practical) in combination with the elementary school. </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">“Elementary education by the state”</span> is altogether objectionable. Defining by a general law the expenditures on the elementary schools, the qualifications of the teaching staff, the branches of instruction, etc., and, as is done in the United States, supervising the fulfilment of these legal specifications by state inspectors, is a very different thing from appointing the state as the educator of the people! Government and Church should rather be equally excluded from any influence on the school. Particularly, indeed, in the Prusso-German Empire (and one should not take refuge in the rotten subterfuge that one is speaking of a “state of the future”; we have seen how matters stand in this respect) the state has need, on the contrary, of a very stern education by the people.</p><p class="s8">But the whole programme, for all its democratic clang, is tainted through and through by the Lassallean sect’s servile belief in the state, or, what is no better, by a democratic belief in miracles, or rather it is a compromise between these two kinds of belief in miracles, both equally remote from socialism.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">“Freedom of science”</span> says a paragraph of the Prussian Constitution. Why, then, here?</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">“Freedom of conscience”!</span> If one desired at this time of the <span class="c1">Kulturkampf</span><a id="footnote-ref330" href="part0057.html#footnote330" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">330</sup></span></a> to remind liberalism of its old catchwords, it surely could have been done only in the following form: Everyone should be able to attend to his religious as well as his bodily needs without the police sticking their noses in. But the workers’ party ought at any rate in this connection to have expressed its awareness of the fact that bourgeois “freedom of conscience” is nothing but the toleration of all possible kinds of <span class="c1">religious freedom of conscience</span>, and that for its part it endeavours rather to liberate the conscience from the witchery of religion. But one chooses not to transgress the “bourgeois” level.</p><p class="s8">I have now come to the end, for the appendix that now follows in the programme does not constitute a characteristic component part of it. Hence I can be very brief here.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s46"><span class="c7">2. </span>“Normal working day.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">In no other country has the workers’ party limited itself to such an indefinite demand, but has always fixed the length of the working day that it considers normal under the given circumstances.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">3. “Restriction of female labour and prohibition of child labour.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The standardisation of the working day must include the restriction of female labour, in so far as it relates to the duration, intermissions, etc., of the working day; otherwise it could only mean the exclusion of female labour from branches of industry that are especially unhealthy for the female body or are objectionable morally for the female sex. If that is what was meant, it should have been said so.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">“Prohibition of child labour.”</span> Here it was absolutely essential to state the age limit. </p><p class="s8">A <span class="c1">general prohibition</span> of child labour is incompatible with the existence of large-scale industry and hence an empty, pious wish. Its realisation—if it were possible—would be reactionary, since, with a strict regulation of the working time according to the different age groups and other safety measures for the protection of children, an early combination of productive labour with education is one of the most potent means for the transformation of present-day society.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">4. “State supervision of factory, workshop and domestic industry.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">In consideration of the Prusso-German state it should definitely have been demanded that the inspectors are to be removable only by a court of law; that any worker can have them prosecuted for neglect of duty; that they must belong to the medical profession.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">5. “Regulation of prison labour.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">A petty demand in a general workers’ programme. In any case, it should have been clearly stated that there is no intention from fear of competition to allow ordinary criminals to be treated like beasts, and especially that there is no desire to deprive them of their sole means of betterment, productive labour. This was surely the least one might have expected from Socialists.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s45">6. “An effective liability law.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">It should have been stated what is meant by an “effective” liability law.</p><p class="s8">Be it noted, incidentally, that in speaking of the normal working day the part of factory legislation that deals with health regulations and safety measures, etc., has been overlooked. The liability law only comes into operation when these regulations are infringed.</p><p class="s8">In short, this appendix also is distinguished by slovenly editing.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2"><span class="c1">Dixi et salvavi animam meam.</span><a id="footnote-ref331" href="part0057.html#footnote331" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">331</sup></span></a></p>
