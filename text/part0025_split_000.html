Two excerpts from Volume Three are presented here.</p><p class="s8">The first (whose title has been given by the editor of this reader) gives Marx’s vision of man in a future condition of freedom—creative leisure—made possible by machine industry and the worldwide proletarian revolution that, as he saw it, was destined to liberate man’s productive activity from the fetters of capitalist acquisitiveness. But there would remain, in this realm of freedom, a residual realm of necessity: the labour time required to produce needed goods under even the most advanced technology.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The second selection is the famous last chapter of Volume Three, entitled “Classes,” in which the manuscript breaks off after Marx has asked: “What constitutes a class?” In fact, there is no mystery about his answer. A class, in Marx’s view, is a special form of the division of labor in society.<a id="footnote-ref292" href="part0057.html#footnote292" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">292</sup></span></a></p>
