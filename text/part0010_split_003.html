<p class="s30">Democracy</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Democracy is the truth of monarchy; monarchy is not the truth of democracy. Monarchy is necessarily democracy inconsistent with itself; the monarchical element is not an inconsistency in democracy. Monarchy cannot be understood in its own terms; democracy can. In democracy none of the elements attains a significance other than what is proper to it. Each is in actual fact only an element of the whole demos [people]. In monarchy one part determines the character of the whole. The entire constitution has to adapt itself to this fixed point. Democracy is the genus Constitution. Monarchy is one species, and a poor one at that. Democracy is content and form. Monarchy is <span class="c1">supposed</span> to be only a form, but it falsifies the content.</p><p class="s8">In monarchy the whole, the people, is subsumed under one of its particular modes of being, the political constitution. In democracy the <span class="c1">constitution itself</span> appears only as <span class="c1">one</span> determination, that is, the self-determination of the people. In monarchy we have the people of the constitution; in democracy the constitution of the people. Democracy is the solved <span class="c1">riddle</span> of all constitutions. Here, not merely <span class="c1">implicitly</span> and in essence but <span class="c1">existing</span> in reality, the constitution is constantly brought back to its actual basis, the <span class="c1">actual human being</span>, the <span class="c1">actual people</span>, and established as the people’s <span class="c1">own</span> work. The constitution appears as what it is, a free product of man. It could be said that in a certain respect this applies also to constitutional monarchy; but the specific distinguishing feature of democracy is that here the <span class="c1">constitution</span> as such forms only <span class="c1">one</span> element in the life of the people—that it is not the <span class="c1">political constitution</span> by itself which forms the state.</p><p class="s8">Hegel starts from the state and makes man the subjectified state; democracy starts from man and makes the state objectified man. Just as it is not religion which creates man but man who creates religion, so it is not the constitution which creates the people but the people which creates the constitution. In a certain respect the relation of democracy to all other forms of state is like the relation of Christianity to all other religions. Christianity is the religion κατ’ εξοχην,<a id="footnote-ref47" href="part0057.html#footnote47" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">47</sup></span></a> the <span class="c1">essence of religion</span>—deified man as a <span class="c1">particular</span> religion. Similarly, democracy is the essence of <span class="c1">all state constitutions</span>—socialised man as a <span class="c1">particular</span> state constitution. Democracy stands to the other constitutions as the genus stands to its species; except that here the genus itself appears as an existent, and therefore as one <span class="c1">particular </span>species over against the others whose existence does not correspond to their essence. To democracy all other forms of state stand as its Old Testament. Man does not exist for the law but the law for man—it is a <span class="c1">human manifestation;</span> whereas in the other forms of state man is a <span class="c1">legal manifestation</span>. That is the fundamental distinction of democracy.</p><p class="s8">All other <span class="c1">state forms</span> are definite, distinct, <span class="c1">particular forms of state</span>. In democracy the <span class="c1">formal</span> principle is at the same time the <span class="c1">material</span> principle. Only democracy, therefore, is the true unity of the general and the particular. In monarchy, for example, and in the republic as a merely particular form of state, political man has his particular mode of being alongside unpolitical man, man as a private individual. Property, contract, marriage, civil society, all appear here (as Hegel shows quite correctly with regard to these <span class="c1">abstract</span> state forms, but he <span class="c1">thinks</span> that he is expounding the idea of the state) as <span class="c1">particular</span> modes of existence alongside the <span class="c1">political</span> state, as the <span class="c1">content</span> to which the <span class="c1">political state</span> is related as <span class="c1">organising form;</span> properly speaking, the relation of the political state to this content is merely that of reason, inherently without content, which defines and delimits, which now affirms and now denies. In democracy the political state, which stands alongside this content and distinguishes itself from it, is itself merely a <span class="c1">particular</span> content and particular <span class="c1">form of existence</span> of the people. In monarchy, for example, this particular, the political constitution, has the significance of the <span class="c1">general</span> that dominates and determines everything particular. In democracy the state as particular is <span class="c1">merely</span> particular; as general, it is the truly general, i.e., not something determinate in distinction from the other content. The French have recently interpreted this as meaning that in true democracy the <span class="c1">political state is annihilated</span>. This is correct insofar as the political state <span class="c1">qua</span> political state, as constitution, no longer passes for the whole. </p><p class="s8">In all states other than democratic ones the <span class="c1">state</span>, the <span class="c1">law</span>, the <span class="c1">constitution</span> is what rules, without really ruling—i.e., without materially permeating the content of the remaining, non-political spheres. In democracy the constitution, the law, the state itself, insofar as it is a political constitution, is only the self-determination of the people, and a particular content of the people.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_6">Incidentally, it goes without saying that all forms of state have democracy <span class="c1">for</span> their truth and that they are therefore untrue insofar as they are not democracy.</p>
