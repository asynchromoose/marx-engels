<p class="s27">M. to R.</p><p class="s27">Kreuznach</p><p class="s27">September, 1843</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">I am delighted that you are resolved and turn your thoughts from backward glances at the past toward a new undertaking. In Paris, then, the old university of philosophy (<span class="c1">absit omen</span>!) and the new capital of the new world. What is necessary will arrange itself. I do not doubt, therefore, that all obstacles—whose importance I do not fail to recognize—will be removed.</p><p class="s8">The undertaking may succeed, however, or not; in any case I will be in Paris at the end of this month, since the air here makes one servile and I see no room at all in Germany for free activity.</p><p class="s8">In Germany, everything is being forcibly repressed, a true anarchy of the spirit has burst out, stupidity itself reigns supreme, and Zurich obeys commands from Berlin; hence it becomes ever clearer that a new gathering point must be sought for the really thinking and independent minds. I am convinced that our plan would meet a real need, and real needs must surely also be able to find real fulfillment. I therefore have no doubts about the enterprise if only we undertake it seriously. </p><p class="s8">The inner difficulties seem to be almost greater than the external obstacles. For even if there is no doubt about the “whence,” all the more confusion reigns about the “whither.” Apart from the general anarchy which has erupted among the reformers, each is compelled to confess to himself that he has no clear conception of what the future should be. That, however, is just the advantage of the new trend: that we do not attempt dogmatically to prefigure the future, but want to find the new world only through criticism of the old. Up to now the philosophers had the solution of all riddles lying in their lectern, and the stupid uninitiated world had only to open its jaws to let the roast partridges of absolute science fly into its mouth. Now philosophy has become worldly, and the most incontrovertible evidence of this is that the philosophical consciousness has been drawn, not only externally but also internally, into the stress of battle. But if the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly what we have to accomplish in the present—I am speaking of a <span class="c1">ruthless criticism of everything existing</span>, ruthless in two senses: The criticism must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the powers that be.</p><p class="s8">I am therefore not in favor of setting up any dogmatic flag. On the contrary, we must try to help the <span class="c1">dogmatics</span> to clarify to themselves the meaning of their own positions. Thus <span class="c1">communism</span>, to be specific, is a dogmatic abstraction. I do not have in mind here some imaginary, possible communism, but actually existing communism in the form preached by Cabet, Dezamy,<a id="footnote-ref39" href="part0057.html#footnote39" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">39</sup></span></a> Weitling,<a id="footnote-ref40" href="part0057.html#footnote40" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">40</sup></span></a> etc. This communism is only a special manifestation of the humanistic principle which is still infected by its opposite—private being. Elimination of private property is therefore by no means identical with this communism, and it is not accidental but quite inevitable that communism has seen other socialist teachings arise in opposition to it, such as the teachings of Fourier, Proudhon, etc. because it is itself only a special, one-sided realization of the socialist principle.</p><p class="s8">And the socialist principle itself represents, on the whole, only one side, affecting the <span class="c1">reality</span> of the true human essence. We have to concern ourselves just as much with the other side, the theoretical existence of man, in other words to make religion, science, etc., the objects of our criticism. Moreover, we want to have an effect on our contemporaries, and specifically on our German contemporaries. The question is, how is this to be approached? Two circumstances cannot be denied. First, religion, and second, politics, arouse predominant interest in contemporary Germany. We must take these two subjects, however they are, for a starting-point, and not set up against them some ready-made system such as the <span class="c1">Voyage en Icarie</span>.<a id="footnote-ref41" href="part0057.html#footnote41" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">41</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Reason has always existed, only not always in reasonable form. The critic can therefore start out by taking any form of theoretical and practical consciousness and develop from the <span class="c1">unique</span> forms of existing reality the true reality as its norm and final goal. Now so far as real life is concerned, precisely the <span class="c1">political state</span> in all its <span class="c1">modern</span> forms contains, even where it is not yet consciously imbued with socialist demands, the demands of reason. Nor does the state stop at that. The state everywhere presupposes that reason has been realized. But in just this way it everywhere comes into contradiction between its ideal mission and its real preconditions. </p><p class="s8">Out of this conflict of the political state with itself, therefore, one can develop social truth. Just as <span class="c1">religion</span> is the catalogue of the theoretical struggles of mankind, so the <span class="c1">political state</span> is the catalogue of its practical struggles. The political state thus expresses, within the confines of its form <span class="c1">sub specie rei publicae,</span><a id="footnote-ref42" href="part0057.html#footnote42" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">42</sup></span></a> all social struggles, needs, truths. Thus it is not at all beneath the <span class="c1">hauteur des principes</span> to make the most specific political question—e.g., the difference between the corporative<a id="footnote-ref43" href="part0057.html#footnote43" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">43</sup></span></a> and the representative system—the object of criticism. For this question only expresses in a political way the difference between the rule of man and the rule of private property. The critic therefore not only can but must go into these political questions (which the crass kind of socialists consider beneath anyone’s dignity). By showing the superiority of the representative system over the corporative system, the critic <span class="c1">affects the practical interests</span> of a large party. By elevating the representative system from its political form to its general form and by bringing out the true significance underlying this system, the critic at the same time forces this party to go beyond its own confines, since its victory is at the same time its loss.</p><p class="s8">Nothing prevents us, then, from tying our criticism to the criticism of politics and to a definite party position in politics, and hence from identifying our criticism with real struggles. Then we shall confront the world not as doctrinaires with a new principle: “Here is the truth, bow down before it!” We develop new principles to the world out of its own principles. We do not say to the world: “Stop fighting; your struggle is of no account. We want to shout the true slogan of the struggle at you.” We only show the world what it is fighting for, and consciousness is something that the world <span class="c1">must</span> acquire, like it or not.</p><p class="s8">The reform of consciousness consists <span class="c1">only</span> in enabling the world to clarify its consciousness, in waking it from its dream about itself, in <span class="c1">explaining</span> to it the meaning of its own actions. Our whole task can consist only in putting religious and political questions into self-conscious human form—as is also the case in Feuerbach’s criticism of religion. </p><p class="s8">Our motto must therefore be: Reform of consciousness not through dogmas, but through analyzing the mystical consciousness, the consciousness which is unclear to itself, whether it appears in religious or political form. Then it will transpire that the world has long been dreaming of something that it can acquire if only it becomes conscious of it. It will transpire that it is not a matter of drawing a great dividing line between past and future, but of carrying out the thoughts of the past. And finally, it will transpire that mankind begins no <span class="c1">new</span> work, but consciously accomplishes its old work.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">So, we can express the trend of our journal in one word: the work of our time to clarify to itself (critical philosophy) the meaning of its own struggle and its own desires. This is work for the world and for us. It can only be the work of joint forces. It is a matter of <span class="c1">confession</span>, no more. To have its sins forgiven mankind has only to declare them to be what they really are.</p>
