His early writings, presented in Part I of this book, include some that were published in 1844, soon after he wrote them, and some not destined to appear in print until the 1930s.</p><p class="s8">The most important of the latter group are the <span class="c1">Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</span> and <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> (Part I of which appears to have been one of Marx’s contributions to this book written jointly by himself and Engels), and the <span class="c1">Grundrisse.</span> Marx explained the non-publication of <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> in the brief history of his opinions that he gave in the Preface to <span class="c1">A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</span>. As for the 1844 manuscripts, which were a very rough first sketch of his theory of history in notes and draft chapters of a projected treatise on the “criticism of political economy,” these remained in a raw, unfinished state among his private papers. The papers came into Engels’ possession after Marx’s death in 1883, and went to the leaders of the German Social Democratic Party after Engels’ death in 1895. After the Russian Revolution, the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow acquired photocopies of the manuscript materials. Its director, the noted Marx scholar David Riazanov, took charge of the editing of the unpublished early writings, and, thanks largely to his labors, these writings finally came out in the 1920s and 1930s.<a id="footnote-ref1" href="part0057.html#footnote1" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">1</sup></span></a> Later, Riazanov, like so many other prominent Russian Marxists, died in Stalin’s purges.</p><p class="s8">Although reactions were somewhat slow in coming, the publication of the previously unknown early writings was a pivotal event in the history of Marxism and of scholarship about Marxism. Because they reflected the genesis and growth of the Marxist system of thought in the mind of its principal creator, the 1844 manuscripts and Part I of <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> illuminated the origins of the system, its relation to post-Kantian German philosophy, and the meaning of some of Marx’s basic concepts. Only then, in fact, did it become possible to trace in depth and detail, stage by stage, the emergence of Marxism.</p><p class="s8">The manner of Marxism’s emergence was a subject that Marx and Engels left in some obscurity although they dealt with it now and then, for example in <span class="c1">Engels’ Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</span>. But what they had to say was enigmatic. In Marxism, which has its foundation in what they variously called the “materialist conception of history” or “historical materialism,”<a id="footnote-ref2" href="part0057.html#footnote2" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">2</sup></span></a> socialist thought had—they said—graduated from its earlier “utopian” stage and become “scientific.” Whereas the “utopian” socialists had visualized a socialist reorganization of society as something that <span class="c1">ought</span> to be realized, the materialist conception of history had conclusively demonstrated that the human historical process was moving toward a worldwide anticapitalist revolution that would usher in socialism or communism (Marx and Engels tended to use these two words interchangeably).</p><p class="s8">Yet this “scientific socialism” of Marx and Engels was not in a direct line of descent from the teachings of the classical utopian socialists, the early-nineteenth-century fathers of modern socialist thought: Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owen. Its immediate intellectual source was, rather, German philosophy, particularly that of Hegel. The materialist conception of history had originated in an inversion of Hegel’s idealist conception of history, an intellectual operation whereby the Hegelian dialectic was, as Engels expressed it in one of his later writings, “placed upon its head; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing, and placed upon its feet.”<a id="footnote-ref3" href="part0057.html#footnote3" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">3</sup></span></a> This only repeated what Marx himself had written in 1873 in the Afterword to the second German edition of <span class="c1">Capital</span>, where he observed that thirty years earlier he had criticized the “mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic,” and added: “The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel’s hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.” So Marx and Engels.</p><p class="s8">The enigma mentioned above will now be apparent. Social theories normally do not originate through turning metaphysical systems of thought “right side up again.” How could Marx’s materialist conception of history arise by means of an inversion of Hegel’s idealist conception? Hegel represents history as the self-realization of spirit (<span class="c1">Geist</span>) or God. The fundamental scheme of his theory is as follows. Spirit is self-creative energy imbued with a drive to become fully conscious of itself as spirit. Nature is spirit in its self-objectification in space; history is spirit in its self-objectification as culture—the succession of world-dominant civilizations from the ancient Orient to modern Europe. Spirit actualizes its nature as self-conscious being by the process of knowing. Through the mind of man, philosophical man in particular, the world achieves consciousness of itself as spirit. This process involves the repeated overcoming of spirit’s “alienation” (<span class="c1">Entfremdung</span>) from itself, which takes place when spirit as the knowing mind confronts a world that appears, albeit falsely, as objective, i.e. as <span class="c1">other</span> than spirit. Knowing is recognition, whereby spirit destroys the illusory otherness of the objective world and recognizes it as actually subjective or <span class="c1">selbstisch</span>. The process terminates at the stage of “absolute knowledge,” when spirit is finally and fully “at home with itself in its otherness,” having recognized the whole of creation as spirit—Hegelianism itself being the scientific form of this ultimate self-knowledge on spirit’s part. Such is the argument of Hegel’s great work <span class="c1">The Phenomenology of Mind</span> (1807), on which he elaborated further in his later writings.</p><p class="s8">A philosophical tour de force this, but what does it have to do with Marxism? How could the materialist conception of history and “scientific socialism” be Hegelian in derivation? Marx and Engels asserted such a relationship in terms too clear for misunderstanding. Engels, to cite a further example, wrote the following about Hegel’s system: </p><p class="s21"> </p><p class="s21">“Abstract and idealist though it was in form, yet the development of his thoughts always proceeded parallel with the development of world history and the latter is really meant to be only the test of the former. If, thereby, the real relation was inverted and stood on its head, nevertheless the <span class="c1">real content</span> entered everywhere into the philosophy; all the more so since Hegel—in contrast to his disciples—did not parade ignorance, but was one of the finest intellects of all time… <span class="c1">This epoch-making conception of history was the direct theoretical premise for the new materialist outlook</span>…<a id="footnote-ref4" href="part0057.html#footnote4" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">4</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s22">But nowhere did Marx and Engels adequately explain just <span class="c1">how</span> Hegel’s conception of history had served as the “direct theoretical premise” of Marxism. The materials needed for clarification of the matter did, however, exist—in Marx’s desk drawer.</p><p class="s8">He alluded to this fact when he recalled in the 1873 Afterword to <span class="c1">Capital</span> that thirty years earlier he had criticized the “mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic.” His reference could have been to either or both of two of his still-unpublished early writings: an unfinished commentary of 1843 on Hegel’s <span class="c1">Philosophy of Right</span>, or the section of the 1844 manuscripts entitled “Critique of Hegel’s Dialectic and Philosophy in General.” Now that these and other early writings of Marx are available, Marxism’s Hegelian derivation has ceased to be a mystery. Marx and Engels were correct in saying that Hegelianism had been the “direct theoretical premise” for the materialist conception of history. So great were the philosophical complexities of this transition, however, that the two men understandably refrained in their later years from offering a detailed explanation to their socialist followers, who in their majority were unversed and uninterested in post-Kantian German philosophy.</p><p class="s8">Briefly, Marx created his theory of history as a conscious act of <span class="c1">translation</span> of Hegel’s theory into what he, Marx, took to be its valid or scientific form. In this he followed the procedure of the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, author of <span class="c1">The Essence of Christianity</span> (1841), who had argued that Hegel’s philosophy could reveal scientific truth if subjected to “transformational criticism.” This consisted in the <span class="c1">inverting</span> of its principal propositions, meaning that one transposed subject and predicate in them. For Hegel man is spirit (or God) in the process of self-alienation and self-realization, i.e. man presents himself in history as self-alienated God. The truth, says Feuerbach, is just the reverse. Instead of seeing man as self-alienated God, we must see God as self-alienated man. That is, when man, the human species, projects an idealized image of itself into heaven as “God” and worships this imaginary heavenly being, it becomes estranged from itself; its own ungodly earthly reality becomes alien and hateful. To overcome this alienation man must repossess his alienated being, take “God” back into himself, recognize in man—and specifically in other human individuals—the proper object of care, love, and worship. Such is the basic argument of Feuerbach’s <span class="c1">Essence of Christianity</span>. Transformational criticism of Hegel yields the theme that religion is a phenomenon of human self-estrangement. The conception of history as the self-realization of God or spirit through man is transformed into the conception of history as the self-realization of the human species via the detour of alienation in the sphere of religion. Hegelian idealism undergoes a metamorphosis and becomes Feuerbachian “humanism.”</p><p class="s8">For Marx, as for others on the Hegelian left in Germany, Feuerbach’s “transformational criticism” of Hegel was an intellectual innovation of epochal importance. The message that Hegelian theory has truth-value if one applies the method of inversion came with a ring of revelation. It meant that one could go on making good use of Hegel while escaping the toils of his colossal and seemingly so otherworldly system. One could discover social reality, the reality of the human predicament in history, by turning Hegel “right side up.” Man was not the personification of spirit; rather, spirit was the thought-process taking place in man. But as Feuerbach had shown, this thought-process as depicted by Hegel was a reflection of the actual movement of history. The Hegelian picture of spirit alienated from itself was, on this reading, simply the philosopher’s upside-down and hence “mystified” vision of the real social process, namely, <span class="c1">man’s</span> alienation from himself in the material world. Furthermore, man’s alienation could be traced out in other spheres than religion. The state, for example, was a sphere of human alienation, and could be exposed as such by applying to Hegel’s <span class="c1">political</span> philosophy the same method of transformational criticism that Feuerbach had applied to his general theory of history. Marx undertook this work in 1843 in a critical commentary on Hegel’s <span class="c1">Philosophy of Right</span>. He did not complete the commentary, but summed up the most important parts of its message in two articles published in 1844. In one of them, the essay “On the Jewish Question,” he portrayed the political life of man as analogous to the religious life, as treated in <span class="c1">The Essence of Christianity</span>. Just as man projects the idealized attributes of the species into his image of a transcendent deity, so he projects social power into a separate sphere—the state—which dominates him. Here, however, the resulting division of man against himself is not a matter of the imagination simply but of institutional reality; and the escape from political alienation, unlike that from religious alienation, requires a real revolution—a collective act whereby the citizens repossess the social power externalized in state institutions.</p><p class="s8">Applying “transformational criticism” to Hegel’s political philosophy, Marx inverted the Hegelian proposition on the relation between the state and “civil society” (<span class="c1">bürgerliche Gesellschaft</span>, by which Hegel meant the realm of private economic endeavor). Civil society was not an outgrowth of the state, as in Hegel’s view; rather, the state was an outgrowth of civil society. The primary sphere of man’s being was not his life as a citizen of the state but rather his economic life in civil society; this was the foundation on which all else rested. Having reached this position via the critical commentary on Hegel’s <span class="c1">Philosophy of Right</span>,<a id="footnote-ref5" href="part0057.html#footnote5" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">5</sup></span></a> Marx was approaching the end of the strange road leading him to the formulation of the materialist conception of history. Now he posed for himself the task of investigating the economic life as a sphere of human self-alienation. In pursuit of this aim he undertook an intensive study of Adam Smith and other classical theorists of political economy. In these economic writings, read in conjunction with Hegel, he hoped to find a key to the understanding of man’s alienation as a producer of material goods. At some point in the course of these studies he was struck by the thought that was to prove the cornerstone of the Marxian system: the fundamental human reality reflected in a mystified way in Hegel’s philosophy of history was the reality of man’s alienation in economic life. This was the underlying master theme of the papers that we now know as the <span class="c1">Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</span>.</p><p class="s8">Deciphering what he conceived to be the hidden meaning-content of Hegel’s <span class="c1">Phenomenology of Mind</span>, Marx here formulated his own conception of history as a process of self-development of the human species culminating in communism. Man, according to this conception, is essentially a producer; and material production is the primary form of his producing activity, industry being the externalized productive powers of the species. In the course of his history, which Marx described as a “history of production,” a world of created objects gradually arises around man. Original nature is overlaid with a man-made or “anthropological nature.” And Marx believed that this was the true or scientific restatement of the Hegelian conception. For had not Hegel seen the history of the world as a production-history on the part of spirit? His error had been to mystify the process by treating the productive activity as <span class="c1">spirit </span>activity. To move from mystification to reality, from philosophy to science, one had only to turn Hegel on his head. Then it appeared that the Hegelian image of spirit creating a world was simply a philosopher’s distorted picture of the reality of history, namely, that man—working man—creates a world in <span class="c1">material</span> productive activities over the centuries. Inevitably, therefore, Marx later named his transformed Hegelianism the “materialist conception of history.”</p><p class="s8">Still following Hegel’s basic scheme, Marx in the 1844 manuscripts visualized the human history of production as being also a history of estrangement (<span class="c1">Entfremdungsgeschichte</span>). Man’s nature, he postulated, was to be a “free conscious producer,” but so far he had not been able to express himself freely in productive activity. He had been driven to produce by need and greed, by a passion for accumulation which in the modern bourgeois age becomes accumulation of capital. His productive activity had always, therefore, been involuntary; it had been “labour.” And since man, when he produces involuntarily, is estranged from his human nature, labour is “alienated labour.”<a id="footnote-ref6" href="part0057.html#footnote6" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">6</sup></span></a> Escape from alienated labour finally becomes materially possible in the stage of technological development created by modern machine industry. The way of escape lies in the revolutionary seizure and socialization of the productive powers by the proletariat. Repossessed through revolution of his organs of material production externalized in industry, man will at last be able to produce in freedom. Human self-realization will be attained on the scale of all humanity. So Marx defined communism in the 1844 manuscripts as “transcendence of human self-alienation” and “positive humanism.” He saw it as the real future situation that Hegel had dimly adumbrated at the close of his <span class="c1">Phenomenology</span>, where spirit, having attained absolute knowledge, is beyond all alienation and fully “at home with itself in its otherness.” Working man would no longer be confronted by an alienated world of objects appropriated as private property. He would dwell in aesthetic communion with an “anthropological nature” transformed into the common possession of all. Man would realize his human nature as a free conscious producer, engaging in a variety of creative activities no longer actuated by the drive to accumulate property.</p><p class="s8">Such was Marxism in its original formulation in Marx’s manuscripts of 1844, for which Hegelianism was indeed the direct theoretical premise. This “original Marxism” was the foundation of the mature Marxist system, the matrix of the materialist conception of history as encountered in the later writings of Marx and Engels. We have evidence of this in the fact that there was no significant hiatus in time between the initial statement of the Marxist position in the manuscripts, which Marx completed in August of 1844, and the systematic formulation of the materialist conception of history that he gave in Part One of <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span>. He laid out some of the underlying main themes of the latter in the spring of 1845 in a set of notes that have come down to us under the title “Theses on Feuerbach.” He also expounded the theory to Engels, with whom he met in Brussels at that time. Marx had the theory of history “ready worked out” by then, recalled Engels in a note to the 1890 edition of the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span>. The theory that Marx was able to set forth orally and in writing by the spring of 1845 must have been the one blocked out in his manuscripts of the previous year.</p><p class="s8">As the reader will see, there are numerous differences between these two early versions of Marxism. The German philosophical terminology, and therefore also the philosophical foundations, are far more clearly apparent in the manuscripts than in Part One of <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span>. The concept of man’s alienation, which plays so central a part in the first formulation, is no longer an <span class="c1">explicit</span> centerpiece of the theory as reformulated. Now we are in the more impersonal world of Marxian social theory as made familiar in the later writings, with their characteristic emphasis upon class struggle as the driving force of history. The ethical themes so strikingly present in the manuscripts, such as the notion of “positive humanism” as the goal of human history, are not so salient now. All these changes have presented problems for contemporary scholarship in Marx studies, and should certainly not be dismissed as of small importance. But neither, on the other hand, should they be overemphasized, as though there were some profound rift between original and later Marxism. It appears, for example, that much of the content of the idea of man’s alienation lives on in the mature Marx in the meaning that he and Engels assign to the concept “division of labour.” The moral theme in Marxism arising out of its view of alienation as an evil, and something destined to be abolished by a final worldwide revolution, remains present in later Marxism’s representation of the division of labour as an evil that has plagued man all through his history, in different ways, and will be ended by the proletarian revolution. Scholarly opinion is inclining, and in my opinion will increasingly incline, to the view that there is an underlying basic continuity of thought not only between the 1844 manuscripts and <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span>, but more broadly between the early Marx and the Marx of the later writings culminating in <span class="c1">Capital</span>.<a id="footnote-ref7" href="part0057.html#footnote7" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">7</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">But the significance of the now-discovered early Marx goes far beyond these questions of the intellectual development of Marxism and its exegesis. The early writings are of very considerable intrinsic interest. The 1844 manuscripts disclose a strangely modern youthful Marx speaking in accents almost of an existentialist philosopher, a Marx alive to psychological themes of interest to many in the second half of the twentieth century. Some European existentialists have recognized a kindred mind in Marx, and one influential thinker of the psychoanalytic school has made use of some of the ideas of the manuscripts in formulating a neo-Freudian philosophy of man.<a id="footnote-ref8" href="part0057.html#footnote8" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">8</sup></span></a> Many in Russia and Eastern Europe, reacting against Stalinism and the dreary orthodoxy of official Communist Marxism, have found support and inspiration in the early Marx for a new, morally aware, critical Marxism—a Marxism that sees the possibility of alienation not only in bourgeois societies but in those officially called “socialist.” For these reasons, among others, the early writings that Marx left unfinished and unpublished are widely read today.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">II</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The German word <span class="c1">Kritik</span>, which may be translated as either “criticism” or “critique,” is a symbol of great importance for comprehending the mental world of Marx and Engels. It was the watchword of the circle of Young Hegelians with whom they were associated at the end of the 1830s and the beginning of the 1840s. Marx interpreted it in a spirit of radical negation of social reality, as reflected in his letter of 1843 to Arnold Ruge calling for a “ruthless criticism of everything existing.” In his essay of 1844, “Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s <span class="c1">Philosophy of Right</span>,” he elaborated his concept and program of criticism and pointed to the proletariat as the real social force destined to carry out criticism’s verdict by overthrowing the existing order. In <span class="c1">The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism</span> (1845), Marx and Engels proclaimed their break with the Young Hegelian group. But no break with the idea of <span class="c1">Kritik</span> was intended.</p><p class="s8">In addition, as we have seen, Marx learned from Feuerbach a specific technique of critical thought involving the use of Hegel. By means of this technique Feuerbach had produced a criticism of religion as a phenomenon of human self-alienation. Taking up the critical enterprise in this sense, Marx produced, first, a criticism of the state as a phenomenon of human self-alienation, and then, in his manuscripts of 1844, the beginnings of what he called a “criticism of political economy.” Engels, who acquired a deep interest in economics still earlier through working in his father’s firm and being exposed to economic realities at the site of its English branch in Manchester, preceded Marx in undertaking a criticism of political economy. He produced an essay, “Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy,” which appeared, along with Marx’s essays on the Jewish question and the Hegelian <span class="c1">Philosophy of Right</span>, in the <span class="c1">Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</span> of 1844. Marx’s references to this essay in the prefaces to his 1844 manuscripts and <span class="c1">A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</span> testify to the influence that it had upon him at the time it appeared.</p><p class="s8">“This political economy or science of enrichment born of the merchants’ mutual envy and greed,” wrote Engels at the beginning of his 1844 essay, “bears on its brow the mark of the most loathsome selfishness.” The essay addressed itself to this argument through a systematic analysis of the categories of the “science of enrichment.” In conclusion Engels referred to the factory system and announced his future intention to “expound in detail the despicable immorality of this system, and to expose mercilessly the economist’s hypocrisy which here appears in all its glitter.”<a id="footnote-ref9" href="part0057.html#footnote9" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">9</sup></span></a> The projected work did not materialize, but Engels did publish in 1845, based on his English observations, <span class="c1">The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844</span>. Strictly descriptive though this work was, it was obviously concerned with exposing the “despicable immorality of this system.”<a id="footnote-ref10" href="part0057.html#footnote10" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">10</sup></span></a> It was a work of <span class="c1">Kritik</span>.</p><p class="s8">Elsewhere I have suggested that Marx was a writer who spent the greater part of his life writing one important book under a number of different titles. In the 1844 manuscripts he set out to produce a <span class="c1">Kritik</span> of political economy, seeking to demonstrate, in terms of the categories of political economy, man’s alienation as a worker in bourgeois society. Having achieved in these papers a sketch of his entire world-view, he set the manuscripts aside but in a few years time returned to the task he had posed for himself. <span class="c1">Wage Labour and Capital</span>, written in 1847, was a sort of prospectus for the full-scale <span class="c1">Kritik</span> of political economy that he was determined to write. In 1859 he published a not very successful beginning of the work under the title <span class="c1">A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</span>. Meanwhile, in 1857–58 he had written a huge new set of manuscripts that would one day be published under the title <span class="c1">Fundamentals of the Critique of Political Economy.</span><a id="footnote-ref11" href="part0057.html#footnote11" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">11</sup></span></a> When he finally completed the work and published it in 1867 under the title of <span class="c1">Capital</span>, he subtitled it <span class="c1">Critique of Political Economy</span>. In short, <span class="c1">Capital</span> was the form in which Marx finally finished the book on the criticism of political economy that he had originally undertaken in his manuscripts of 1844.</p><p class="s8">The idea of <span class="c1">Kritik</span> is, then, a great unifying theme running through the writings of classical Marxism, and a key to the continuity of the thought of Marx and Engels from their youthful philosophical writings to the productions of their mature years. Although they devoted a great deal of energy to economic analysis and contributed writings—especially <span class="c1">Capital</span>—that constitute a significant and influential chapter in economic thought, they did so not as political economists in the ordinary sense but as <span class="c1">critics</span> of political economy. As such they wrote from a position that we can variously describe as moral, normative, or philosophical. It would be a great mistake, therefore, to think of the writings gathered in Part II of this volume as belonging to a compartment called “Marxian economics,” separate from the remainder of their thought. These writings are in the mainstream of their thought about society and history, their revolutionary outlook, and their socialism. The serious student of Marx must get to know <span class="c1">Capital</span> as Marx’s major book about man. As the attentive reader of these pages will discover, it is the book, too, into which he poured his views on a miscellany of topics of general interest, such as education, the family and its future, the implications of modern technological development, and so on.</p><p class="s8">For all its tortuous complexity and abstruseness of argument, <span class="c1">Capital</span> (I refer here to Volume One) is fairly simple in basic theme and design. It could be viewed as an eight-hundred-page elaboration of the passage from <span class="c1">The Holy Family</span><a id="footnote-ref12" href="part0057.html#footnote12" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">12</sup></span></a> speaking of private property and the proletariat as opposites forming an antagonistic “whole” that is moving toward its own ultimate dissolution because of private property’s inherent tendency to generate more and more proletariat, which in turn is “conscious of itself as a dehumanization and hence abolishes itself.” In <span class="c1">Capital</span> the antagonistic “whole” is presented as wage labour (<span class="c1">Lohnarbeit</span>) or, alternatively, as the capital-labour relationship—this being the relationship of production constitutive of capitalism itself as a mode of production.<a id="footnote-ref13" href="part0057.html#footnote13" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">13</sup></span></a> For Marx this relationship of production is the “basis” of bourgeois society, over which arises the institutional and ideological “superstructure.” The real subject of the book, in his mind, is bourgeois society.</p><p class="s8">In wage labour, the argument runs, the worker sells to the capitalist employer the only commodity that he possesses, his labour power, and receives in recompense a wage reflecting this commodity’s “value.” Since, on Marx’s assumptions about value, the value of any commodity is equivalent to the amount of average necessary labour time incorporated in it, the value of one day’s labour power as a commodity is the monetary equivalent of the amount of resources required to keep the worker alive and at work and able to reproduce his kind, i.e. it is a subsistence wage. But when put to use by the capitalist for a day, this labour power is capable, Marx reasons, of producing a certain amount of value over and above its own value. This Marx calls “surplus value” (<span class="c1">Mehrwert</span>), and he characterizes capitalism as a system geared to the maximizing of surplus value through intense—and ever-intensifying—exploitation of labour power to the utmost extent sufferable by “that repellent yet elastic natural barrier, man.” Further, surplus value has two forms. “Absolute surplus value,” meaning the excess of new value created in a day over the value of the labour power bought by the capitalist, can be increased by lengthening the working day itself. “Relative surplus value,” arising out of improvements in technology that reduce the necessary labour time invested in labour power, can be obtained by mechanization of production processes and therewith the degree of specialization in the factory, so that the worker becomes a detail labourer performing ever more minute and monotonous operations. The capitalists are driven willy-nilly by the imperatives of their situation to accumulate capital by increasing surplus value along both these lines, so that “in proportion as capital accumulates, the lot of the labourer, be his payment high or low, must grow worse.” The “absolute general law of capitalist accumulation,” as Marx christens it, “establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite’ pole . . .” This conclusion of the argument points to the violent breakdown of the “whole” that Marx heralds toward the end of the book, where he speaks of the coming “expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the people.”</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Capital</span> was written by an angry man, and one can hardly read it without sensing the indignation that he felt in the face of the phenomena with which he was concerned. The great <span class="c1">Kritik</span> of political economy is a work of analysis and description, but also of moral condemnation and protest. The word “alienation” may be missing, but the theme is not.<a id="footnote-ref14" href="part0057.html#footnote14" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">14</sup></span></a> <span class="c1">Capital’s</span> proletarian is still <span class="c1">The Holy Family’s</span> “dehumanization which is conscious of itself as a dehumanization and hence abolishes itself.” What was called “alienated labour” in the manuscripts of 1844 appears here simply as “wage labour.” Now the object of study is subjected to endless analysis in terms of the labour theory of value and to lavish documentation out of the annals of British factory inspectors’ reports, but it is the same object, and the viewpoint taken toward it is also the same.</p><p class="s8">The basis of the moral condemnation of wage labour is not that the wages are too low,<a id="footnote-ref15" href="part0057.html#footnote15" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">15</sup></span></a> but that wage labour by its very nature dehumanizes man. This means, for Marx, that it defeats his natural human urge toward spontaneous productive activity, converts his free creativity into forced labour and drudgery, and frustrates his human need for a variety of occupations. The latter theme—the division of labour or occupational specialization as an evil—is a salient one in <span class="c1">Capital</span>; and the history of the evolution of the modern factory system that Marx gives in Part IV of the book is not presented out of an interest in economic history per se but as a means of describing the horrifying extremes that the division of labour attains under the “machinofacture” developed during the Industrial Revolution. As he expresses his view here, “…constant labour of one uniform kind disturbs the intensity and flow of a man’s animal spirits, which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity.” That this was Engels’ view as well, and more generally that the condemnation of division of labour as an evil belongs to the core of classical Marxism, is well illustrated in the section of Engels’ <span class="c1">Anti-Dühring</span> that has been included in the present volume under the heading “On the Division of Labour in Production.”</p><p class="s8">In their later writings, then, Marx and Engels are still writing from the standpoint summed up in Marx’s 1844 manuscripts as “positive humanism.” They are writing on behalf of a socialism that means to them not a new system of distribution (though that, too, they are sure, will come about) but a new mode of productive activity that is to be achieved through the revolutionary liberation of human productiveness from the bonds of factory toil for the accumulation of “surplus value.” They advanced no particular name for this new mode of production, but described it in various places as the free activity of human beings producing in cooperative association. The socialization of the means of production was not, on this view, the essence of socialism or communism, but only its precondition.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">III</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Although born of German philosophy, Marxism from the beginning eschewed philosophy’s contemplative attitude toward the world and adopted as its own the standpoint of the “unity of theory and practice.” In the familiar words of Marx’s eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, “The philosophers have only <span class="c1">interpreted</span> the world, in various ways; the point is to <span class="c1">change</span> it.” Apart from being a critical comment on former philosophy, this statement had a biographical meaning. Not content with theorizing about a revolution in the abstract, Marx and Engels concerned themselves deeply with the strategy and tactics of a socialist revolution, the organizing of revolutionary activity, the politics of world-change. In the materials gathered in Part III of this volume, and also in the political journalism represented in Part IV, we see the reflection of this side of their activity.</p><p class="s8">In Marx’s and Engels’ own minds, it should be added, there was no clear demarcation line between their theoretical work and their practical and organizing activities. For various reasons they would hardly have agreed with the statement of their future Russian disciple, Lenin, that “without a revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.”<a id="footnote-ref16" href="part0057.html#footnote16" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">16</sup></span></a> They thought of a revolutionary movement as a spontaneous phenomenon of mass rebelliousness generated by conditions of existence that people find intolerable, hence not something dependent on a revolutionary theory for its emergence. Both <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> and the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> offer unequivocal testimony on this point. But on the other hand, Marx and Engels believed that a correct revolutionary theory could powerfully <span class="c1">assist</span> a revolutionary movement by providing explanations and orienting its members to the movement’s proper ends and means. Their own theorizing appeared to them a historic case in point. The Marxist theory was simply the contemporary proletarian revolutionary movement—an ongoing or incipient phenomenon in every industrial society—come to full programmatic consciousness. It was the prospectus of the revolutionary process taking place in bourgeois society, explaining its underlying causes and foretelling its preordained future course and outcome. By their theorizing as such, therefore, they were actively influencing historical events. Such, at any rate, was their view.</p><p class="s8">An obvious implication of this reasoning was that everything possible should be done to disseminate knowledge of the Marxist revolutionary theory and secure its acceptance by the organized workers’ movement. <span class="c1">The Communist Manifesto</span> is an outstanding example of such effort. Marx’s powerful polemical tract on <span class="c1">The Civil War in France</span>, an account of the Paris Commune and its suppression, may also be seen in this light. To explain the Paris Revolution of September, 1870-May, 1871, according to the canons of Marxist theory and assess its historic meaning in Marxist terms was to show Marxism’s cogency as a mode of understanding contemporary historical reality and thereby to enhance its influence on educated minds. So successful was the pamphlet in achieving this purpose that one later historian of the socialist movement dates the widespread impact of Marxism from that time.<a id="footnote-ref17" href="part0057.html#footnote17" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">17</sup></span></a> Much of the political journalism of Marx and Engels appears to have had, at least in part, a similar motivation. They propagated Marxism by seeking to demonstrate its applicability to current events. In <span class="c1">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</span>, to take a particularly important example, Marx recounted the recent political history of France in a Marxist frame of reference. The result in this instance, as in some others, was a work of journalism that has taken its place also as a classic of Marxist historiography.</p><p class="s8">The nineteenth century was a birth-time of socialist theories and programs. Since Marxism at mid-century was only one of numerous available versions of socialist thought, its propagation by Marx and Engels was a highly competitive enterprise. In <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> they attacked and ridiculed the doctrines of their fellow German “true socialists.” A year later, in 1847, Marx published <span class="c1">The Poverty of Philosophy</span>, a polemic against the theories of the French socialist and anarchist thinker Pierre Joseph Proudhon. In the ensuing decades he and Engels waged a long-drawn-out struggle against Proudhonism and generally against the anarchist persuasion in socialism, one of whose leading proponents in the later nineteenth century was the Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin. Paradoxically, the Paris Commune of 1871 was, in its decentralizing measures, a victory of the Proudhonian influence, but this in no way inhibited Marx and Engels from hailing the Commune as a harbinger of the realization of the Marxist theory of history and hence claiming it for Marxism.<a id="footnote-ref18" href="part0057.html#footnote18" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">18</sup></span></a> Another arena of their competitive struggle for the dominance of the Marxist theory was German working-class politics, in which a prominent part was played by the gifted political leader Ferdinand Lassalle. Their fight against Lassallean doctrinal influences continued unabated after Lassalle’s death in 1864 and finally was immortalized in a set of notes by Marx that was published posthumously under the title <span class="c1">Critique of the Gotha Program</span> and has since taken its place as one of Marxism’s major programmatic statements.</p><p class="s8">The International Working Men’s Association, founded in London in 1864 by representatives of the English, French, German, and Italian workers as an international coordinating body for the working-class movements of these and other countries, offered an important forum for the propagation of Marxism. Although he was present at the founding meeting of the association, now better known as the First International, Marx was not one of its original organizers. Subsequently, however, he played a leading part in its affairs. In drafting the rules of the association, he prefaced them with an “Inaugural Address” written in his characteristically forceful and incisive manner. Although he had to hold the revolutionary rhetoric in check because of constraints arising from the diverse membership of this loose federation of worker groups from different countries, he managed to formulate the Address in the spirit of Marxist doctrine and make of it a kind of successor-document to the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span>. Later, when the fall of the Paris Commune made European revolutionary prospects and hence those of the International appear dim for the time being, Marx was concerned lest Bakunin and the anarchists acquire a decisive influence in the association. He therefore proposed, at its Hague Congress in 1872, that the headquarters be moved to New York. The ensuing transfer to America signaled the International’s demise.</p><p class="s8">Marxism was not a party doctrine in its inception, nor did Marx and Engels originally envisage it as the formal ideology of a political party. The Communist League, on whose behalf they wrote the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span>, was not a political party but only a group of a few hundred German journeymen workers living in Paris, Brussels, and London. In the <span class="c1">Manifesto</span>, moreover, Marx and Engels explicitly disclaimed the notion that the communists (i.e., the Marxists) should form themselves into a separate party, or that they should “set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.” The communists, they went on, were simply the most consistently radical representatives of the proletarian movement and those with clear theoretical understanding of its conditions and aims. In later years, however, Marx arid Engels shifted their ground in response to the rise of working-class political parties in a number of European countries, Germany in particular. A General German Workers’ Society arose in 1863 under Lassalle. Three years later a German Social Democratic Workers’ Party was founded under the leadership of Wilhelm Liebknecht, a longtime follower of Marx. The merger of the two groups in 1875 established the German Social Democrats as the leading working-class political party of Western Europe, with Marxist socialism as its ideology; and similar parties emerged in Italy, Austria, France, and elsewhere. Although the name “Social Democrat” did not please them,<a id="footnote-ref19" href="part0057.html#footnote19" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">19</sup></span></a> Marx and Engels welcomed the rise of socialist working-class parties professing Marxism as their platform.</p><p class="s8">The irony of this development was that Marxism’s very success in the struggle for supremacy in working-class politics of the later nineteenth century endangered what Lenin later called its “revolutionary soul.” Although officially dedicated to Marxist principles of the revolutionary transformation of society, the Social Democratic parties were not really very radical. In some instances, such as in Germany, they were associated with organized trade union movements whose aims were basically reformist. Finally, increasing electoral success gave them both a place and a stake in the existing order, and encouraged the tendency of the party leaderships to look to the ballot box and the gradual conquest of political power by peaceful parliamentary means as the highroad to a socialist reshaping of society. The concern this aroused in Marx and Engels is clearly shown in their “Circular Letter” of September 17–18, 1879, to Bebel, Liebknecht, and other German Social Democratic leaders. It castigated the spirit of reformism spreading in the German party and insisted upon fidelity to the revolutionary class struggle as the only possible means of freeing the working classes.</p><p class="s8">It is a fact, however, that without renouncing his basic revolutionism and the related belief that the socialist revolution would in most countries have to take place by force, Marx envisaged the possibility of a nonviolent path to socialism in certain countries, like America and Britain, whose political institutions made radical change by democratic means conceivable. A very clear statement to this effect was made in a speech in Amsterdam in 1872.<a id="footnote-ref20" href="part0057.html#footnote20" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">20</sup></span></a> In <span class="c1">The State and Revolution</span> (1917) Lenin contended that conditions in those countries had so changed in the interim that a Marxist could no longer recognize such potential exceptionalism. Meanwhile, the leading Social Democratic Marxist theorist, Karl Kautsky, held to and expanded upon Marx’s position, and the split between Communist (i.e., Marxist-Leninist) and Social Democratic Marxism in the twentieth century turned largely on this issue. Much later, in 1956, Soviet Marxism under Nikita Khrushchev adopted a modified form of Marx’s old position by positing that in certain (especially underdeveloped) countries with powerful Communist parties, socialist revolution could take place by a “peaceful parliamentary path.”<a id="footnote-ref21" href="part0057.html#footnote21" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">21</sup></span></a> Among revolutionaries and theorists of revolution, the question of the role of violence in social revolution remains controversial to this day.</p><p class="s8">Marx died in 1883 and Engels survived him by twelve years during which the German Social Democrats continued their advance at the polls. In an essay published in 1895 that proved to be his own valedictory to the Social Democratic movement,<a id="footnote-ref22" href="part0057.html#footnote22" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">22</sup></span></a> Engels seemed to soften the Circular Letter’s insistence on revolutionary class struggle as the only acceptable political strategy for a Marxist party. At any rate, he allowed that classic street-fighting on the barricades had largely been rendered obsolete by technological improvements favoring the military, and hailed the German Social Democrats’ two million voters as “the decisive ‘shock force’ of the international proletarian army.” But on close reading, particularly after restoration of those passages excised from the essay by the editors when it was originally published in 1895, Engels’ concluding discourse on tactics turns out to be by no means an endorsement of Social Democratic reformism. His commitment to the Marxian revolutionary idea held firm to the end. For the older Engels, no less than for the younger Marx, the point was to change the world radically.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">IV</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The meetings between Marx and Engels in Paris in August,1844, and in Brussels in April, 1845, inaugurated a partnership that continued unbroken to Marx’s death nearly forty years after. Indeed, it continued beyond that time, for Engels devoted his final years to carrying forward the work on which he and his friend had been engaged together for so long. Intellectual history offers few if any comparable examples of lifelong collaboration between innovative minds. How shall we assess the relative weight of their contributions? </p><p class="s8">In a footnote to an essay of 1886, Engels answered this question as follows:</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s23">I cannot deny that both before and during my forty years’ collaboration with Marx I had a certain independent share in laying the foundations of the theory, and more particularly in its elaboration. But the greater part of its leading basic principles, especially in the realm of economics and history, belong to Marx. What I contributed—at any rate with the exception of my work in a few special fields—Marx could very well have done without me. What Marx accomplished I would not have achieved. Marx stood higher, saw further, and took a wider and quicker view than all the rest of us. Marx was a genius; we others were at best talented. Without him the theory would not be by far what it is today. It therefore rightly bears his name.<a id="footnote-ref23" href="part0057.html#footnote23" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">23</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">This generous tribute rightly recognized that Marx’s mind was the forge of the system. True, Engels during his first sojourn in Manchester had independently and somewhat earlier than Marx come to the view that economics is the decisively important force in history, and his “Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy” had helped to inspire Marx’s first attempt at such a critique. Yet Marxism as a transformed Hegelianism, a theory of history in the grand style, was essentially, as we have seen, Marx’s creation. He was the seer and system-builder in relation to whom the merely talented Engels was bound to play a subordinate part.</p><p class="s8">But after acknowledging this, it must also be said that Engels was misleadingly modest concerning his own contributions. The Marx-Engels correspondence reflects a two-way process of collaboration in which Engels gave theoretical assistance to Marx—for example, on various problems encountered in the writing of <span class="c1">Capital</span>—as well as vice versa. Engels’ independent contributions were substantial too, both in the works that he and Marx wrote jointly and in some that he produced on his own. One of the special fields of his expertise was military affairs and strategy. Another was natural science, and his writings on this subject—including the papers posthumously published under the title <span class="c1">Dialectics of Nature</span>—gave the impetus to the rise of “dialectical materialism” as a Marxist teaching about nature. Whether one feels that Marxism was enriched or vulgarized by the latter development, its importance is undeniable. Still another area of Engels’ work was primitive society. He carried out Marx’s unfulfilled plan of writing a treatise based upon the American anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan’s <span class="c1">Ancient Society</span>. The resulting work on <span class="c1">The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</span><a id="footnote-ref24" href="part0057.html#footnote24" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">24</sup></span></a> provided Marxism with an anthropology, including a theory and history of the family and a viewpoint on the role of women in society.</p><p class="s8">As the writings gathered in Part V of this volume show, moreover, one of Engels’ greatest services consisted in the systematizing and popularizing of Marxism. Marx was the great system-builder, yet he never managed in the writings published during his lifetime to set forth the fundamentals of the system in easily understandable terms in an essay or short book; <span class="c1">Capital</span> was not bedtime reading for the masses. Engels made good this deficiency. He lacked the supremely trenchant style of Marx, who wrote as though his pen were dipped in molten anger. But Engels’ beautifully clear and free-flowing prose was ideally suited to the popularizing work to which he applied himself. In a number of letters on historical materialism<a id="footnote-ref25" href="part0057.html#footnote25" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">25</sup></span></a> he attempted to clarify the economic interpretation of history and deal with certain questions that had arisen concerning it. His <span class="c1">Anti-Dühring</span> gave a running exposition of Marxism in the course of a polemic against one of its critics, and the portion of it published in 1880 under the title <span class="c1">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</span> probably did more than any other single book to disseminate knowledge of Marxism. Engels even undertook to bring <span class="c1">Capital</span> to the wide public by writing nine different reviews of it, seven of which achieved publication at the time.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">Paraphrasing Engels, one could say that without him Marxism would not be by far what it became. His gifts and Marx’s were in large measure complementary. Classical Marxism is an amalgam in which Engels’ work constitutes an essential and inalienable part.</p><div class="calibre1" id="calibre_pb_1"></div></div></body></html>
