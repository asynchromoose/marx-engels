Later, the national election of December 10, 1848, brought to the French Republic’s presidency Napoleon’s nephew, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who in 1851 made himself emperor by <span class="c1">coup d’état</span>.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">In this most mordantly brilliant of his revolutionary pamphlets, first published in 1850 as a series of articles in <span class="c1">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</span>, Marx not only coined such well-known phrases as “Revolutions are the locomotives of history”; he portrayed the French workers’ action as the debut of a coming Europe-wide proletarian revolution, and interspersed his narrative of France’s 1848 revolution with passages of broader import that illuminate key points in his thought. These passages have been gathered together in the selection presented here.<a id="footnote-ref357" href="part0057.html#footnote357" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">357</sup></span></a></p>
