It was both a review of the working-class movement since 1848 and a program. Despite the echo of the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> in the dosing words (“Proletarians of all countries, Unite!”), some have seen the Inaugural Address, with its salute to the English Ten Hours’ Bill, as a herald of the decreasingly revolutionary Marxist Social Democratic movement of the late nineteenth century. Against this interpretation must be set Marx’s shorthand recapitulation of his theory of history and proletarian revolution in the statement here that “hired labor is but a transitory and inferior form, destined to disappear before associated labour plying its toil with a willing hand, a ready mind, and a joyous heart.” Given the disparate character of the various national contingents of the new association, some less radical than others, there was also a tactical reason for restraint on revolutionary rhetoric. As Marx wrote to Engels on November 4, 1864: “It was very difficult to frame the thing so that our view should appear in a form acceptable from the present stand point of the workers’ movement . . . It will take time before the reawakened movement allows the old boldness of speech.”</p>
