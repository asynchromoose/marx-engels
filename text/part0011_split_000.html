The criticism of politics is developed in the first part, leading to the conclusion that human emancipation requires the ending of the division between man as an egoistic being in “civil society” and man as abstract citizen in the state. In the second part, Marx proceeds to the criticism of economics or commerce, which he equates with “Judaism.” His concluding call for “the emancipation of society from Judaism” (which has been seen on occasion as a manifesto of anti-Semitism) is in fact a call for the emancipation of society from what he here calls “huckstering,” or from what he was subsequently to call “capitalism.” This, however, is not to deny that Marx, although he himself was of Jewish origin, harbored anti-Jewish attitudes, nor is it to deny that such attitudes found expression in this essay.</p>
