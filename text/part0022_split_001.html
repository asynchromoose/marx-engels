Long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists the economic anatomy of the classes. What I did that was new was to prove: 1) that the <span class="c1">existence of classes</span> is only bound up with <span class="c1">particular historical phases in the development of production</span>, 2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the <span class="c1">dictatorship of the proletariat,</span> 3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the <span class="c1">abolition of all classes</span> and <span class="c1">to a classless society.</span></p>
