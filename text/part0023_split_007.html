Transposition of powers of labour into powers of capital both in fixed and in circulating capital.—To what extent <span class="c4">fixed capital (machine)</span> creates value.—Lauderdale. Machine presupposes a mass of workers.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">As long as the means of labour remains a means of labour in the proper sense of the term, such as it is directly, historically, adopted by capital and included in its realization process, it undergoes a merely formal modification, by appearing now as a means of labour not only in regard to its material side, but also at the same time as a particular mode of the presence of capital, determined by its total process—as <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>. But, once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the <span class="c1">machine</span>, or rather, an <span class="c1">automatic system of machinery</span> (system of machinery: the <span class="c1">automatic</span> one is merely its most complete, most adequate form, and alone transforms machinery into a system), set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages. In the machine, and even more in machinery as an automatic system, the use value, i.e. the material quality of the means of labour is transformed into an existence adequate to fixed capital and to capital as such; and the form in which it was adopted into the production process of capital, the direct means of labour, is superseded by a form posited by capital itself and corresponding to it. In no way does the machine appear as the individual worker’s means of labour. Its distinguishing characteristic is not in the least, as with the means of labour, to transmit the worker’s activity to the object; this activity, rather, is posited in such a way that it merely transmits the machine’s work, the machine’s action, on to the raw material—supervises it and guards against interruptions. Not as with the instrument, which the worker animates and makes into his organ with his skill and strength, and whose handling therefore depends on his virtuosity. Rather, it is the machine which possesses skill and strength in place of the worker, is itself the virtuoso, with a soul of its own in the mechanical laws acting through it; and it consumes coal, oil etc, (<span class="c1">matières instrumentales</span>), just as the worker consumes food, to keep up its perpetual motion. The worker’s activity, reduced to a mere abstraction of activity, is determined and regulated on all sides by the movement of the machinery, and not the opposite. The science which compels the inanimate limbs of the machinery, by their construction, to act purposefully, as an automaton, does not “exist in the worker’s consciousness, but rather acts upon him through the machine as an alien power, as the power of the machine itself. The appropriation of living labour by objectified labour—of the power or activity which creates value by value existing for-itself—which lies in the concept of capital, is posited, in production resting on machinery, as the character of the production process itself, including its material elements and its material motion. The production process has ceased to be a labour process in the sense of a process dominated by labour as its governing unity. Labour appears, rather, merely as a conscious organ, scattered among the individual living workers at numerous points of the mechanical system; subsumed under the total process of the machinery itself, as itself only a link of the system, whose unity exists not in the living workers, but rather in the living (active) machinery, which confronts his individual, insignificant doings as a mighty organism. In machinery, objectified labour confronts living labour within the labour process itself as the power which rules it; a power which, as the appropriation of living labour, is the form of capital. The transformation of the means of labour into machinery, and of living labour into a mere living accessory of this machinery, as the means of its action, also posits the absorption of the labour process in its material character as a mere moment of the realization process of capital. The increase of the productive force of labour and the greatest possible negation of necessary labour is the necessary tendency of capital, as we have seen. The transformation of the means of labour into machinery is the realization of this tendency. In machinery, objectified labour materially confronts living labour as a ruling power and as an active subsumption of the latter under itself, not only by appropriating it, but in the real production process itself; the relation of capital as value which appropriates value-creating activity is, in fixed capital existing as machinery, posited at the same time as the relation of the use value of capital to the use value of labour capacity; further, the value objectified in machinery appears as a presupposition against which the value-creating power of the individual labour capacity is an infinitesimal, vanishing magnitude; the production in enormous mass quantities which is posited with machinery destroys every connection of the product with the direct need of the producer, and hence with direct use value; it is already posited in the form of the product’s production and in the relations in which it is produced that it is produced only as a conveyor of value, and its use value only as condition to that end. In machinery, objectified labour itself appears not only in the form of product or of the product employed as means of labour, but in the form of the force of production itself. The development of the means of labour into machinery is not an accidental moment of capital; but is rather the historical reshaping of the traditional, inherited means of labour into a form adequate to capital. The accumulation of knowledge and of skill, of the general productive forces of the social brain, is thus absorbed into capital, as opposed to labour, and hence appears as an attribute of capital, and more specifically of <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, in so far as it enters into the production process as a means of production proper. <span class="c1">Machinery</span> appears, then, as the most adequate form of <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, and fixed capital, in so far as capital’s relations with itself are concerned, appears as <span class="c1">the most adequate form of capital</span> as such. In another respect, however, in so far as fixed capital is condemned to an existence within the confines of a specific use value, it does not correspond to the concept of capital, which, as value, is indifferent to every specific form of use value, and can adopt or shed any of them as equivalent incarnations. In this respect, as regards capital’s external relations, it is <span class="c1">circulating capital</span> which appears as the adequate form of capital, and not fixed capital.</p><p class="s8">Further, in so far as machinery develops with the accumulation of society’s science, of productive force generally, general social labour presents itself not in labour but in capital. The productive force of society is measured in <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, exists there in its objective form; and, inversely, the productive force of capital grows with this general progress, which capital appropriates free of charge. This is not the place to go into the development of machinery in detail; rather only in its general aspect; in so far as the <span class="c1">means of labour</span>, as a physical thing, loses its direct form, becomes <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, and confronts the worker physically as <span class="c1">capital</span>. In machinery, knowledge appears as alien, external to him; and living labour [as] subsumed under self-activating objectified labour. The worker appears as superfluous to the extent that his action is not determined by [capital’s] requirements.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The full development of capital, therefore, takes place—or capital has posited the mode of production corresponding to it—only when the means of labour has not only taken the economic form of <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, but has also been suspended in its immediate form, and when <span class="c1">fixed capital</span> appears as a machine within the production process, opposite labour; and the entire production process appears as not subsumed under the direct skillfulness of the worker, but rather as the technological application of science. [It is,] hence, the tendency of capital to give production a scientific character; direct labour [is] reduced to a mere moment of this process. As with the transformation of value into capital, so does it appear in the further development of capital, that it presupposes a certain given historical development of the productive forces on one side—science too [is] among these productive forces—and, on the other, drives and forces them further onwards.</p><p class="s8">Thus the quantitative extent and the effectiveness (intensity) to which capital is developed as fixed capital indicate the general degree to which capital is developed as capital, as power over living labour, and to which it has conquered the production process as such. Also, in the sense that it expresses the accumulation of objectified productive forces, and likewise of objectified labour. However, while capital gives itself its adequate form as use value within the production process only in the form of machinery and other material manifestations of fixed capital, such as railways etc. (to which we shall return later), this in no way means that this use value—machinery as such—is capital, or that its existence as machinery is identical with its existence as capital; any more than gold would cease to have use value as gold if it were no longer <span class="c1">money</span>. Machinery does not lose its use value as soon as it ceases to be capital. While machinery is the most appropriate form of the use value of fixed capital, it does not at all follow that therefore subsumption under the social relation of capital is the most appropriate and ultimate social relation of production for the application of machinery.</p><p class="s8">To the degree that labour time—the mere quantity of labour—is posited by capital as the sole determinant element, to that degree does direct labour and its quantity disappear as the determinant principle of production—of the creation of use values—and is reduced both quantitatively, to a smaller proportion, and qualitatively, as an, of course, indispensable but subordinate moment, compared to general scientific labour, technological application of natural sciences, on one side, and to the general productive force arising from social combination [<span class="c1">Gliederung</span>] in total production on the other side—a combination which appears as a natural fruit of social labour (although it is a historic product). Capital thus works towards its own dissolution as the form dominating production.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s29"><span class="c4">Fixed capital and circulating capital</span> as two particular kinds of capital. Fixed capital and continuity of the production process.—Machinery and living labour. (Business of inventing)</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">While, up to now, fixed capital and circulating capital appeared merely as different passing aspects of capital, they have now hardened into two particular modes of its existence, and fixed capital appears separately alongside circulating capital. They are now two particular kinds of capital. In so far as a capital is examined in a particular branch of production, it appears as divided into these two portions, or splits into these two kinds of capital in certain p[rop]ortions.</p><p class="s8">The division within the production process, originally between means of labour and material of labour, and finally product of labour, now appears as circulating capital (the last two) and fixed capital [the first.]<a id="footnote-ref240" href="part0057.html#footnote240" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">240</sup></span></a> The split within capital as regards its merely physical aspect has now entered into its form itself, and appears as differentiating it.</p><p class="s8">From a viewpoint such as Lauderdale’s etc., who would like to have capital as such, separately from labour, create <span class="c1">value</span> and hence also<span class="c1"> surplus value</span> (or profit), fixed capital—namely that whose physical presence or use value is machinery—is the form which gives their superficial fallacies still the greatest semblance of validity. The answer to them, e.g. in <span class="c1">Labour Defended</span>, [is] that the road builder may share [profits] with the road-user, but the “road” itself cannot do so.<a id="footnote-ref241" href="part0057.html#footnote241" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">241</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Circulating capital—presupposing that it really passes through its different phases—brings about the decrease or increase, the brevity or length of circulation time, the easier or more troublesome completion of the different stages of circulation, a decrease of the surplus value which could be created in a given period of time without these interruptions—either <span class="c1">because the number of reproductions grows smaller</span>, or because the quantity of <span class="c1">capital continuously engaged in the production process</span> is reduced. In both cases this is not a reduction of the initial value, but rather a reduction of the rate of growth. From the moment, however, when fixed capital has developed to a certain extent—and this extent, as we indicated, is the measure of the development of large industry generally—hence fixed capital increases in proportion to the development of large industry’s productive forces—it is itself the objectification of these productive forces, as presupposed product—from this instant on, every interruption of the production process acts as a direct reduction of capital itself, of its initial value. The value of fixed capital is reproduced only in so far as it is used up in the production process. Through disuse it loses its use value without its value passing on to the product. Hence, the greater the scale on which fixed capital develops, in the sense in which we regard it here, the more does the <span class="c1">continuity of the production process</span> or the constant flow of reproduction become an externally compelling condition for the mode of production founded on capital.</p><p class="s8">In machinery, the appropriation of living labour by capital achieves a direct reality in this respect as well: It is, firstly, the analysis and application of mechanical and chemical laws, arising directly out of science, which enables the machine to perform the same labour as that previously performed by the worker. However, the development of machinery along this path occurs only when large industry has already reached a higher stage, and all the sciences have been pressed into the service of capital; and when, secondly, the available machinery itself already provides great capabilities. Invention then becomes a business, and the application of science to direct production itself becomes a prospect which determines and solicits it. But this is not the road along which machinery, by and large, arose, and even less the road on which it progresses in detail. This road is, rather, dissection [<span class="c1">Analyse</span>]—through the division of labour, which gradually transforms the workers’ operations into more and more mechanical ones, so that at a certain point a mechanism can step into their places. (<span class="c1">See under economy of power</span>.) Thus, the specific mode of working here appears directly as becoming transferred from the worker to capital in the form of the machine, and his own labour capacity devalued thereby. Hence the workers’ struggle against machinery. What was the living worker’s activity becomes the activity of the machine. Thus the appropriation of labour by capital confronts the worker in a coarsely sensuous form; capital absorbs labour into itself—“as though its body were by love possessed.”<a id="footnote-ref242" href="part0057.html#footnote242" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">242</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s29">Contradiction between the foundation of bourgeois production <span class="c4">(value as measure)</span> and its development. Machines etc.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The exchange of living labour for objectified labour—i.e. the positing of social labour in the form of the contradiction of capital and wage labour—is the ultimate development of the <span class="c1">value-relation</span> and of production resting on value. Its presupposition is—and remains—the mass of direct labour time, the quantity of labour employed, as the determinant factor in the production of wealth. But to the degree that large industry develops, the creation of real wealth comes to depend less on labour time and on the amount of labour employed than on the power of the agencies set in motion during labour time, whose “powerful effectiveness” is itself in turn out of all proportion to the direct labour time spent on their production, but depends rather on the general state of science and on the progress of technology, or the application of this science to production. (The development of this science, especially natural science, and all others with the latter, is itself in turn related to the development of material production.) Agriculture, e.g., becomes merely the application of the science of material metabolism, its regulation for the greatest advantage of the entire body of society. Real wealth manifests itself, rather—and large industry reveals this—in the monstrous disproportion between the labour time applied, and its product, as well as in the qualitative imbalance between labour, reduced to a pure abstraction, and the power of the production process it superintends. Labour no longer appears so much to be included within the production process; rather, the human being comes to relate more as watchman and regulator to the production process itself. (What holds for machinery holds likewise for the combination of human activities and the development of human intercourse.) No longer does the worker insert a modified natural thing [<span class="c1">Naturgegenstand</span>] as middle link between the object [<span class="c1">Objekt</span>] and himself; rather, he inserts the process of nature, transformed into an industrial process, as a means between himself and inorganic nature, mastering it. He steps to the side of the production process instead of being its chief actor. In this transformation, it is neither the direct human labour he himself performs, nor the time during which he works, but rather the appropriation of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his mastery over it by virtue of his presence as a social body—it is, in a word, the development of the social individual which appears as the great foundation-stone of production and of wealth. The theft of alien labour time, on which the present wealth is based, appears a miserable foundation in face of this new one, created by large-scale industry itself. As soon as labour in the direct form has ceased to be the great well-spring of wealth, labour time ceases and must cease to be its measure, and hence exchange value [must cease to be the measure] of use value. The <span class="c1">surplus labour of the mass</span> has ceased to be the condition for the development of general wealth, just as the <span class="c1">non-labour of the few,</span> for the development of the general powers of human head. With that, production based on exchange value breaks down, and the direct, material production process is stripped of the form of penury and antithesis. The free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them. Capital itself is the moving contradiction, [in] that it presses to reduce labour time to a minimum, while it posits labour time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth. Hence it diminishes labour time in the necessary form so as to increase it in the superfluous form; hence posits the superfluous in growing measure as a condition—question of life or death—for the necessary. On the one side, then, it calls to life all the powers of science and of nature, as of social combination and of social intercourse, in order to make the creation of wealth independent (relatively) of the labour time employed on it. On the other side, it wants to use labour time as the measuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created, and to confine them within the limits required to maintain the already created value as value. Forces of production and social relations—two different sides of the development of the social individual—appear to capital as mere means, and are merely means for it to produce on its limited foundation. In fact, however, they are the material conditions to blow this foundation sky-high. “Truly wealthy a nation, when the working day is 6 rather than 12 hours. <span class="c1">Wealth</span> is not command over surplus labour time” (real wealth), “but rather, <span class="c1">disposable time</span> outside that needed in direct production, for <span class="c1">every</span> individual and the whole society.” (<span class="c1">The Source and Remedy etc</span>., 1821, p. 6)</p><p class="s8">Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules, etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are <span class="c1">organs of the human brain, created by the human hand;</span> the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a <span class="c1">direct force of production</span>, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s29"><span class="c4">Significance of the development of fixed capital</span> (for the development of capital generally).

Contradictory form of the same in capital.—Productivity of labour and production of fixed capital. <span class="c4">(The Source and Remedy.)</span>—Use and consume: <span class="c4">Economist</span>. Durability of fixed capital</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">The development of fixed capital indicates in still another respect the degree of development of wealth generally, or of capital.</span> The aim of production oriented directly towards use value, as well as of that directly oriented towards exchange value, is the product itself, destined for consumption. The part of production which is oriented towards the production of fixed capital does not produce direct objects of individual gratification, nor direct exchange values; at least not directly realizable exchange values. <span class="c1">Hence, only when a certain degree of productivity has already been reached—so that a part of production time is sufficient for immediate production—can an increasingly large part be applied to the production of the means of production.</span> This requires that society be able to wait; that a large part of the wealth already created can be withdrawn both from immediate consumption and from production for immediate consumption, in order to employ this part for labour which is <span class="c1">not immediately productive</span> (within the material production process itself). This requires a certain level of productivity and of relative overabundance, and, more specifically, a level directly related to the transformation of circulating capital into fixed capital. As the <span class="c1">magnitude of relative surplus labour depends on the productivity of necessary labour, so does the magnitude of labour time</span>—living as well as objectified—<span class="c1">employed on the production of fixed capital depend on the productivity of the labour time spent in the direct production of products. Surplus population</span> (from this standpoint), as well as <span class="c1">surplus production</span>, is a condition for this. That is, the output of the time employed in direct production must be larger, relatively, than is directly required for the reproduction of the capital employed in these branches of industry. The <span class="c1">smaller</span> the direct fruits borne by <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, the less it intervenes in the <span class="c1">direct production process</span>, the greater must be this relative <span class="c1">surplus population and surplus production;</span> thus, more to build railways, canals, aqueducts, telegraphs etc. than to build the machinery directly active in the direct production process. Hence—a subject to which we will return later—in the constant under- and over-production of modern industry—constant fluctuations and convulsions arise from the disproportion, when sometimes too little, then again too much circulating capital is transformed into fixed capital.</p><p class="s8">&lt;<span class="c1">The creation of a large quantity of disposable time</span> apart from necessary labour time for society generally and each of its members (i.e. room for the development of the individuals’ full productive forces, hence those of society also), this creation of not-labour time appears in the stage of capital, as of all earlier ones, as not-labour time, free time, for a few. What capital adds is that it increases the surplus labour time of the mass by all means of art and science, because its wealth consists directly in the appropriation of surplus labour time; since <span class="c1">value directly its purpose</span>, not use value. It is thus, despite itself, instrumental in creating the means of social disposable time, in order to reduce labour time for the whole society to a diminishing minimum, and thus to free everyone’s time for their own development. But its tendency always, on the one side, <span class="c1">to create disposable time, on the other, to convert it into surplus labour</span>. If it succeeds too well at the first, then it suffers from surplus production, and then necessary labour is interrupted, because <span class="c1">no surplus labour can be realized by capital</span>. The more this contradiction develops, the more does it become evident that the growth of the forces of production can no longer be bound up with the appropriation of alien labour, but that the mass of workers must themselves appropriate their own surplus labour. Once they have done so—and <span class="c1">disposable time</span> thereby ceases to have an <span class="c1">antithetical</span> existence—then, on one side, necessary labour time will be measured by the needs of the social individual, and, on the other, the development of the power of social production will grow so rapidly that, even though production is now calculated for the wealth of all, <span class="c1">disposable time</span> will grow for all. For real wealth is the developed productive power of all individuals. The measure of wealth is then not any longer, in any way, labour time, but rather disposable time. <span class="c1">Labour time as the measure of value</span> posits wealth itself as founded on poverty, and disposable time as existing <span class="c1">in and because of the antithesis to surplus labour time;</span> or, the positing of an individual’s entire time as labour time, and his degradation therefore to mere worker, subsumption under labour. <span class="c1">The most developed machinery thus forces the worker to work longer than the savage does, or than he himself did with the simplest, crudest tools.</span>&gt;</p><p class="s8">“If the entire labour of a country were sufficient only to raise the support of the whole population, there would be no <span class="c1">surplus labour</span>, consequently nothing that could be allowed to accumulate as capital. If in one year the people raises enough for the support of two years, one year’s consumption must perish, or for one year men must cease from productive labour. But the <span class="c1">possessors of </span>[the]<span class="c1"> surplus produce or capital</span> . . . employ people <span class="c1">upon something not directly and immediately productive,</span> e.g. in the erection of machinery. So it goes on.” (<span class="c1">The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties</span>, p. 4)</p><p class="s8">&lt;As the basis on which large industry rests, the appropriation of alien labour time, ceases, with its development, to make up or to create wealth, so does <span class="c1">direct labour</span> as such cease to be the basis of production, since, in one respect, it is transformed more into a supervisory and regulatory activity; but then also because the product ceases to be the product of isolated direct labour, and the <span class="c1">combination</span> of social activity appears, rather, as the producer. “As soon as the division of labour is developed, almost every piece of work done by a single individual is a part of a whole, <span class="c1">having no value or utility of itself. There is nothing on which the labourer can seize: this is my produce, this I will keep to myself.”</span> (<span class="c1">Labour Defended</span>, p. 25, 1, 2, xi.) In direct exchange, individual direct labour appears as realized in a particular product or part of the product, and its communal, social character—its character as objectification of general labour and satisfaction of the general need—as posited through exchange alone. In the production process of large-scale industry, by contrast, just as the conquest of the forces of nature by the social intellect is the precondition of the productive power of the means of labour as developed into the automatic process, on one side, so, on the other, is <span class="c1">the labour of the individual in its direct presence posited as suspended individual, i.e. as social labour. Thus the other basis of this mode of production falls away</span>.&gt; </p><p class="s8">The labour time employed in the production of fixed capital relates to that employed in the production of circulating capital, within the production process of capital itself, as does <span class="c1">surplus labour time to necessary</span> labour time. To the degree that production aimed at the satisfaction of immediate need becomes more productive, a greater part of production can be directed towards the need of production itself, or the production of means of production. In so far as the production of <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, even in its physical aspect, is directed immediately not towards the production of direct use values, or towards the production of values required for the direct reproduction of capital—i.e. those which themselves in turn represent use value in the value-creation process—but rather towards the production of the means of value creation, that is, not towards value as an immediate object, but rather towards value creation, towards the means of realization, as an immediate object of production—the production of value posited physically in the object of production itself, as the aim of production, the objectification of productive force, the value producing power of capital—to that extent, it is in the production of <span class="c1">fixed capital that capital posits itself as end-in-itself</span> and appears active as capital, <span class="c1">to a higher power than it does in the production of circulating capital</span>. Hence, in this respect as well, the dimension already possessed by fixed capital, which its production occupies within total production, is the measuring rod <span class="c1">of the development</span> of wealth founded on the mode of production of capital.</p><p class="s8">“The number of workers depends as much on <span class="c1">circulating capital</span> as it depends on the quantity of <span class="c1">products of co-existing labour</span>, which labourers are allowed to consume.” (<span class="c1">Labour Defended</span>, p. 20.)</p><p class="s8">In all the excerpts cited above from various economists fixed capital is regarded as the part of capital which is locked into the production process. “Floating capital is consumed; fixed capital is merely used in the great process of production.” (<span class="c1">Economist</span>, VI, 1.) This wrong, and holds only for the part of circulating capital which is itself consumed by the fixed capital, the <span class="c1">matières instrumentales</span>. The only thing consumed “in the great process of production,” if this means the immediate production process, is <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>. Consumption within the production process is, however, in fact <span class="c1">use, wearing-out</span>. Furthermore, the <span class="c1">greater durability of fixed capital</span> must not be conceived as a purely physical quality. The iron and the wood which make up the bed I sleep in, or the stones making up the house I live in, or the marble statue which decorates a palace, are just as durable as iron and wood etc. used for machinery. But <span class="c1">durability</span> is a condition for the instrument, the means of production, not only on the technical ground that metals etc. are the chief material of all machinery, but rather because the instrument is destined to play the same role constantly in repeated processes of production. Its durability as means of production is a required quality of its use value. The more often it must be replaced, the costlier it is; the larger the part of capital which would have to be spent on it uselessly. Its durability is its existence as means of production. Its duration is an increase of its productive force. With circulating capital, by contrast, in so far as it is not transformed into fixed capital, durability is in no way connected with the act of production itself and is therefore not a conceptually posited moment. The fact that among the articles thrown into the consumption fund there are some which are in turn characterized as <span class="c1">fixed capital</span> because they are consumed slowly, and can be consumed by many individuals in series, is connected with further determinations (renting rather than buying, interest etc.) with which we are not yet here concerned.</p><p class="s8">“Since the general introduction of soulless mechanism in British manufactures, people have with rare exceptions been treated as a secondary and subordinate machine, and far more attention has been given to the perfection of the raw materials of wood and metals than to those of body and spirit.” (p. 31. Robert Owen: <span class="c1">Essays on the Formation of the Human Character</span>, 1840, London.)</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s30">Real saving—economy— = saving of labour time = development of productive force. Suspension of the contradiction between free time and labour time.—True conception of the process of social production.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> &lt;Real economy—saving—consists of the saving of labour time (minimum (and minimization) of production costs); but this saving identical with development of the productive force. Hence in no way <span class="c1">abstinence from consumption</span>, but rather the development of power, of capabilities of reproduction, and hence both of the capabilities as well as the means of consumption. The capability to consume is a condition of consumption, hence its primary means, and this capability is the development of an individual potential, a force of production. The saving of labour time [is] equal to an increase of free time, i.e. time for the full development of the individual, which in turn reacts back upon the productive power of labour as itself the greatest productive power. From the standpoint of the direct production process it can be regarded as the production of <span class="c1">fixed capital</span>, this fixed capital being man himself. It goes without saying, by the way, that direct labour time itself cannot remain in the abstract antithesis to free time in which it appears from the perspective of bourgeois economy. Labour cannot become play, as Fourier would like,<a id="footnote-ref243" href="part0057.html#footnote243" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">243</sup></span></a> although it remains his great contribution to have expressed the suspension not of distribution, but of the mode of production itself, in a higher form, as the ultimate object. Free time—which is both idle time and time for higher activity—has naturally transformed its possessor into a different subject, and he then enters into the direct production process as this different subject. This process is then both discipline, as regards the human being in the process of becoming; and, at the same time, practice [<span class="c1">Ausübung</span>], experimental science, materially creative and objectifying science, as regards the human being who has become, in whose head exists the accumulated knowledge of society. For both, in so far as labour requires practical use of the hands and free bodily movement, as in agriculture, at the same time exercise.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_14">As the system of bourgeois economy has developed for us only by degrees, so too its negation, which is its ultimate result. We are still concerned now with the direct production process. When we consider bourgeois society in the long view and as a whole, then the final result of the process of social production always appears as the society itself, i.e. the human being itself in its social relations. Everything that has a fixed form, such as the product etc., appears as merely a moment, a vanishing moment, in this movement. The direct production process itself here appears only as a moment. The conditions and objectifications of the process are themselves equally moments of it, and its only subjects are the individuals, but individuals in mutual relationships, which they equally reproduce and produce anew. The constant process of their own movement, in which they renew themselves even as they renew the world of wealth they create.&gt;</p>
