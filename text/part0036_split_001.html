<p class="s27">London, September 17–18, 1879</p><p class="s33">The Manifesto of the Three Zurichers</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">In the meantime Höchberg’s <span class="c1">Jahrbuch</span> has reached us, containing an article, “The Socialist Movement in Germany in Retrospect,” which, as Höchberg himself tells me, has been written by precisely the three members of the Zurich Commission. Here we have their authentic criticism of the movement up till now and with it their authentic programme for the line of the new organ in so far as this depends on them. </p><p class="s8">Right at the beginning we read:</p><p class="s8">“The movement, which Lassalle regarded as an eminently political one, to which he summoned not only the workers but all honest democrats, <span class="c1">at the head of which</span> were to march the independent representatives of science and <span class="c1">all men imbued with true love of humanity</span>, was diminished under the presidency of Johann Baptist Schweitzer to <span class="c1">a one-sided struggle of the industrial workers in their own interests.”</span></p><p class="s8">I shall not examine whether or how far this is historically accurate. The special reproach here levelled against Schweitzer is that he <span class="c1">diminished </span>Lassalleanism, which is here taken as a bourgeois-democratic-philanthropic movement, to a one-sided struggle in the interest of the industrial workers, by <span class="c1">deepening </span>its character as a class struggle of the industrial workers against the bourgeois. He is further reproached with having “rejected bourgeois democracy.” What business has bourgeois democracy within the Social-Democratic Party anyway? If it consists of “honest men” it cannot wish for admission, and if it does nevertheless wish to be admitted this can only be in order to start a row.</p><p class="s8">The Lassallean party “chose to conduct itself <span class="c1">in the most one-sided</span> way as a <span class="c1">workers’ party.”</span> The gentlemen who write that are themselves members of the party which conducts itself in the most one-sided way as a workers’ party, they are at present invested with offices and dignities in this party. Here there is an absolute incompatibility. If they mean what they write they must leave the party, or at least resign their offices and dignities. If they do not do so, they admit that they are proposing to utilise their official position in order to combat the proletarian character of the Party. Thus, if the Party leaves them their offices and dignities it will be betraying itself.</p><p class="s8">In the opinion of these gentlemen, then, the Social-Democratic Party should <span class="c1">not</span> be a one-sided workers’ party but an all-sided party of “all men imbued with true love of humanity.” It must prove this above all by laying aside coarse proletarian passions and placing itself under the guidance of educated, philanthropic bourgeois “in order to cultivate good taste” and “learn good form” (p. 85). Then the “disreputable behaviour” of some of the leaders will give way to a thoroughly respectable “bourgeois behaviour.” (As if the externally disreputable appearance of those here referred to were not the least they can be reproached with!) Then, too, <span class="c1">“numerous adherents</span> from the circles of the <span class="c1">educated</span> and <span class="c1">propertied</span> classes will make their appearance. But <span class="c1">these</span> must first be won if the . . . agitation conducted is to attain <span class="c1">tangible successes.”</span> German socialism has “attached too much importance to the winning of the <span class="c1">masses</span> and in so doing has neglected energetic [ ! ] propaganda among the so-called upper strata of society.” For “the Party still lacks men fit to represent it in the Reichstag.” It is, however, “desirable and necessary to entrust the mandates to men who have the time and opportunity to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the relevant material. The simple worker and small master craftsman . . . have necessary leisure for this only in rare and exceptional cases.” So elect bourgeois!</p><p class="s8">In short: the working class of itself is incapable of its own emancipation. For this purpose it must place itself under the leadership of “educated and propertied” bourgeois who alone possess the “time and opportunity” to acquaint themselves with what is good for the workers. And secondly, the bourgeoisie is on no account to be fought against but—to be <span class="c1">won over</span> by energetic propaganda.</p><p class="s8">But if one wants to win over the upper strata of society or only its well-disposed elements one must not frighten them on any account. And here the three Zurichers think they have made a reassuring discovery:</p><p class="s8">“Precisely at the present time, under the pressure of the Anti-Socialist Law, the Party is showing that it <span class="c1">is not inclined</span> to pursue the path of violent bloody revolution but is determined . . . to follow the path of legality, that is, of <span class="c1">reform.”</span> So if the 500,000 to 600,000 Social-Democratic voters—between a tenth and an eighth of the whole electorate and, besides, dispersed over the length and breadth of the land—have the sense not to run their heads against a wall and to attempt a “bloody revolution” of one against ten, this proves that they for ever <span class="c1">renounce</span> taking advantage of some tremendous external event, a sudden revolutionary upsurge arising from it or even a <span class="c1">victory</span> of the people gained in a conflict resulting from it. If Berlin should ever again be so uneducated as to have another March 18<a id="footnote-ref336" href="part0057.html#footnote336" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">336</sup></span></a> the Social-Democrats, instead of taking part in the fight as “riff-raff with a mania for barricades” (p. 88), must rather “follow the path of legality,” put on the brakes, clear away the barricades and if necessary march with the glorious army against the one-sided, coarse, uneducated masses. Or if the gentlemen assert that this is not what they meant, what then did they mean?</p><p class="s8">But still better follows.</p><p class="s8">“Hence, the more quiet, objective and deliberate it [the Party] is in its criticism of existing conditions and in its proposals to change them, the less possible will it be to repeat the present successful move [when the Anti-Socialist Law was introduced] by which the conscious reactionaries intimidated the bourgeoisie by conjuring up the Red bogey” (p. 88).</p><p class="s8">In order to relieve the bourgeoisie of the last trace of anxiety it must be clearly and convincingly proved to it that the Red bogey is really only a bogey, and does not exist. But what is the secret of the Red bogey if not the bourgeoisie’s dread of the inevitable life-and-death struggle between it and the proletariat? Dread of the inevitable outcome of the modern class struggle? Do away with the class struggle and the bourgeoisie and “all independent people” will “not be afraid to go hand in hand with the proletarians”! And the ones to be cheated would be precisely the proletarians.</p><p class="s8">Let the Party, therefore, prove by its humble and lowly manner that it has once and for all laid aside the “improprieties and excesses” which occasioned the Anti-Socialist Law. If it voluntarily promises that it only intends to act within the limits of this law, Bismarck and the bourgeoisie will surely have the kindness to repeal it, as it will then be superfluous!</p><p class="s8">“Let no one misunderstand us”; we do not want “to give up our Party and our programme, but think that for years hence we shall have enough to do if we concentrate our whole strength and energy upon the attainment of certain immediate aims which must in any case be achieved before the realisation of the more far-reaching aspirations can be thought of.” Then those bourgeois, petty bourgeois and workers who are “at present frightened away . . . by our far-reaching demands” will join us in masses.</p><p class="s8">The programme is not to be <span class="c1">given up</span> but only <span class="c1">postponed</span>—for an indefinite period. One accepts it, though not really for oneself and one’s own lifetime but posthumously, as an heirloom to be handed down to one’s children and grandchildren. In the meantime one devotes one’s “whole strength and energy” to all sorts of petty rubbish and the patching up of the capitalist order of society in order at least to produce the appearance of something happening without at the same time scaring the bourgeoisie. There I must really praise the “Communist” Miquel, who proves his unshakable belief in the inevitable overthrow of capitalist society in the course of the next few hundred years by swindling for all he’s worth, contributing his honest best to the crash of 1873<a id="footnote-ref337" href="part0057.html#footnote337" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">337</sup></span></a> and so <span class="c1">really</span> doing something to help along the collapse of the existing order.</p><p class="s8">Another offence against good form was the “exaggerated attacks on the company promoters,” who were after all “only children of their time”; it would therefore “have been better to abstain . . . from abusing Strousberg and similar people.” Unfortunately everyone is only a “child of his time” and if this is a sufficient excuse nobody ought ever to be attacked any more, all controversy, all struggle on our part ceases; we quietly accept all the kicks our adversaries give us because we, who are so wise, know that these adversaries are “only children of their time” and cannot act otherwise. Instead of repaying their kicks with interest we ought rather to pity these unfortunates.</p><p class="s8">Then again the support of the Commune had the disadvantage, nevertheless, that “people who were otherwise well disposed to us were alienated and in general the <span class="c1">hatred of the bourgeoisie </span>against us was increased.” Furthermore, the Party “is not wholly without blame for the passage of the October Law,<a id="footnote-ref338" href="part0057.html#footnote338" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">338</sup></span></a> for it had increased the <span class="c1">hatred of the bourgeoisie unnecessarily.”</span></p><p class="s8">There you have the programme of the three censors of Zurich. In clarity it leaves nothing to be desired. Least of all to us, who are very familiar with the whole of this phraseology from the 1848 days. It is the representatives of the petty bourgeoisie who are here presenting themselves, full of anxiety that the proletariat, under the pressure of its revolutionary position, may “go too far.” Instead of determined political opposition, general mediation; instead of struggle against the government and the bourgeoisie, an attempt to win over and persuade them; instead of defiant resistance to ill treatment from above, humble submission and confession that the punishment was deserved. Historically necessary conflicts are all interpreted as misunderstandings, and all discussion ends with the assurance that after all we are all agreed on the main point. The people who came out as bourgeois democrats in 1848 could just as well call themselves Social-Democrats now. To the former the democratic republic was as unattainably remote as the overthrow of the capitalist system is to the latter, and therefore is of absolutely no importance in present-day politics; one can mediate, compromise and philanthropise to one’s heart’s content. It is just the same with the class struggle because its existence can no longer be denied, but in practice it is hushed up, diluted, attenuated, The Social-Democratic Party <span class="c1">is not</span> to be a workers’ party, is not to incur the odium of the bourgeoisie or of anyone else; it should above all conduct energetic propaganda among the bourgeoisie; instead of laying stress on far-reaching aims which frighten away the bourgeoisie and after all are not attainable in our generation, it should rather devote its whole strength and energy to those petty-bourgeois patchwork reforms which, by providing the old order of society with new props, may perhaps transform the ultimate catastrophe into a gradual, piece-meal and as far as possible peaceful process of dissolution. These are the same people who, ostensibly engaged in indefatigable activity, not only do nothing themselves but try to prevent anything happening at all except—chatter; the same people whose fear of every form of action in 1848 and 1849 obstructed the movement at every step and finally brought about its downfall, the same people who never see reaction and are then quite astonished to find themselves in the end in a blind alley where neither resistance nor flight is possible, the same people who want to confine history within their narrow Philistine horizon and over whose heads history invariably proceeds to the order of the day.</p><p class="s8">As to their socialist convictions, this has been adequately criticised already in the <span class="c1">Manifesto</span>, the chapter on “German, or ‘True,’ Socialism.” Where the class struggle is pushed aside as a disagreeable “coarse” phenomenon, nothing remains as a basis for socialism but “true love of humanity” and empty phraseology about “justice.”</p><p class="s8">It is an inevitable phenomenon, rooted in the course of development, that people from what have hitherto been the ruling classes should also join the militant proletariat and supply it with educative elements. We clearly stated this in the <span class="c1">Manifesto</span>. But here two points are to be noted:</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">First,</span> in order to be of use to the proletarian movement these people must bring real educative elements into it. But with the great majority of the German bourgeois converts that is not the case. Neither the <span class="c1">Zukunft</span> nor the <span class="c1">Neue Gesellschaft</span><a id="footnote-ref339" href="part0057.html#footnote339" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">339</sup></span></a> have contributed anything which could advance the movement one step further. Here there is an absolute lack of real education material, whether factual or theoretical. In its place there are attempts to bring superficially mastered socialist ideas into harmony with the exceedingly varied theoretical standpoints which these gentlemen have brought with them from the university or elsewhere and of which, owing to the process of decomposition which the remnants of German philosophy are at present undergoing, one is more confused than the other. Instead of thoroughly studying the new science themselves to begin with, each of them preferred to trim it to fit the point of view he already had brought along, made himself forthwith a private science of his own and at once came forward with the pretension of wanting to teach it. Hence, there are about as many points of view among these gentry as there are heads; instead of producing clarity in a single case they have only produced desperate confusion—fortunately almost exclusively among themselves. Educative elements whose first principle is to teach what they have not learnt can very well be dispensed with by the Party.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Secondly</span>. If people of this kind from other classes join the proletarian movement, the first condition must be that they should not bring any remnants of bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, etc., prejudices with them but should whole-heartedly adopt the proletarian outlook. But these gentlemen, as has been proved, are chock-full of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. In such a petty-bourgeois country as Germany these ideas certainly have their justification. But only <span class="c1">outside </span>the Social-Democratic Workers’ Party. If these gentlemen constitute themselves into a Social-Democratic petty-bourgeois party they have a perfect right to do so; one could then negotiate with them, form a <span class="c1">bloc</span> according to circumstances, etc. But in a workers’ party they are an adulterating element. If reasons exist for tolerating them there for the moment it is also duty <span class="c1">only</span> to tolerate them, to allow them no influence in the Party leadership and to remain aware that a break with them is only a matter of time. That time, moreover, seems to have come. How the Party can tolerate the authors of this article in its midst any longer is incomprehensible to us. But if even the leadership of the Party should fall more or less into the hands of such people, the Party would simply be castrated and there would be an end of proletarian snap.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2"> As for ourselves, in view of our whole past there is only one path open to us. For almost forty years we have stressed the class struggle as the immediate driving power of history and in particular the class struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat as the great lever of the modern social revolution; it is, therefore, impossible for us to co-operate with people who wish to expunge this class struggle from the movement. When the International was formed we expressly formulated the battle cry: The emancipation of the working class must be the work of the working class itself. We cannot, therefore, co-operate with people who openly state that the workers are too uneducated to emancipate themselves and must first be freed from above by philanthropic big bourgeois and petty bourgeois. If the new Party organ adopts a line corresponding to the views of these gentlemen, a line that is bourgeois and not proletarian, then nothing remains for us, much though we should regret it, but publicly to declare our opposition to it, and to dissolve the solidarity with which we have hitherto represented the German Party abroad. But it is to be hoped that things will not come to <span class="c1">that </span>pass.</p>
