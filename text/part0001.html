  <body class="calibre"><div class="body"><span id="chapter-1" class="c"></span><p class="s7">Preface to the Second Edition</p><p class="s8">A knowledge of the writings of Marx and Engels is virtually indispensable to an educated person in our time, whatever his political position or social philosophy. For classical Marxism, as the thought of Marx and Engels may be called, has profoundly affected ideas about history, society, economics, ideology, culture, and politics; indeed, about the nature of social inquiry itself. No other intellectual influence has so powerfully shaped the mind of modern left-wing radicalism in most parts of the world. Through classical Marxism, moreover, the left is linked to a greater intellectual tradition extending into the eighteenth-century French Enlightenment, German post-Kantian philosophy, English political economy, and early-nineteenth-century European socialism. Not to be well grounded in the writings of Marx and Engels is to be insufficiently attuned to modern thought, and self-excluded to a degree from the continuing debate by which most contemporary societies live insofar as their members are free and able to discuss the vital issues.</p><p class="s8">This book offers the original writings needed to acquire a thorough grounding in Marxist thought, together with introductory notes to each selection, a chronology of the careers of the two men, and a concluding bibliographic guide to some of the literature about them and their thought. I have aimed to place between the covers of one volume all or nearly all of what could be considered “the essential Marx and Engels.” Since their published writings and correspondence fill more than forty volumes, such an undertaking involves difficult problems of selection. In resolving them I have followed certain established traditions in the anthologizing of Marx and Engels, but also have sought to break fresh ground. The main innovations are the inclusion of the principal early writings of Marx and substantial portions of <span class="c1">Capital</span> and the <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span>.</p><p class="s8">The inclusion of the early Marx is a response to the revolution that has taken place in “Marxology” in our time owing to the publication in the 1930s of some previously unknown writings of Marx’s formative period. I shall say more about these writings and their significance in the Introduction. The outcome of the new Marx scholarship, as I shall argue, is a deeper and clearer understanding both of Marxism’s origins in post-Kantian German philosophy and of its fundamental meaning. The new scholarship has also made plain the basic underlying continuity that exists between the early and later Marx. For these reasons, among others, the most important of the early writings deserve to be represented in any collection of the essential Marx and Engels, and have been included here. </p><p class="s8">Marx without <span class="c1">Capital</span> is Kant without <span class="c1">The Critique of Pure Reason</span> or Darwin without <span class="c1">The Origin of Species</span>. Even though he completed only the first volume of it, leaving the second and third volumes in unfinished form to be edited and published by Engels after he died, <span class="c1">Capital</span> was Marx’s great work. When he completed and published Volume One in 1867, he described it in a letter to a friend as the book “to which I have sacrificed my health, my happiness and my family.” When read closely and in the context of the remainder of his writings, <span class="c1">Capital</span> turns out to be not simply Marx’s major treatise on political economy, but his principal work on man, society, and government—indeed, the fullest expression of his entire world-view. Clearly, there can be no “essential Marx and Engels” with <span class="c1">Capital</span> missing, yet the book is forbidding on account of its great size—about eight hundred pages—and its complexity. Feeling that token solutions of this problem through the inclusion mainly of Marx’s prefaces to <span class="c1">Capital</span> are unsatisfactory, I have tried to resolve it by putting together sufficiently extensive extracts to convey the book’s basic argument, the parts of greatest general interest.</p><p class="s8">The hospitable reception of this volume since its appearance five years ago has encouraged me to prepare a revised and enlarged edition to meet more fully the needs of teacher and student in the various disciplines for which Marxist thought is important. </p><p class="s8">No changes have been made in those respects in which the book seems to have proved sound: the five-part plan of organization; the idea of combining the thematic with the chronological in arranging the material; the integration of the early philosophical Marx with the later writings of both Marx and Engels; the inclusion of <span class="c1">Capital</span>; and the premise that Engels, in some measure, is quite indispensable—that a general anthology of classical Marxism cannot properly meet the needs of student and teacher unless it is a Marx-Engels reader. On the other hand, the material added in the new edition is mostly—but not exclusively—by Marx. The Marx portion of the reader, already predominant in the first edition, has been substantially increased in this one.</p><p class="s8"> Additions are of two kinds: the inclusion of works, or material from works, not represented in the first edition; and the addition of more material to works that were included in less than the desirable measure. A small number of excisions, in no case involving a work as a whole, have been made in order to help accommodate voluminous additions without unduly increasing the book’s bulk and cost. </p><p class="s8">Of the two parts that have been most heavily enlarged, one is Part I (“The Early Marx”), where I have added selections from Marx’s commentary of 1843 on Hegel’s <span class="c1">Philosophy of Right</span> (Marx’s most extended work of strictly political analysis); the important section of the <span class="c1">Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844</span> on “The Meaning of Human Requirements”; selections from the student Marx’s letter to his father in 1837, from Marx’s doctoral dissertation, from the article “Critical Marginal Notes,” and from Marx’s early exposition of historical materialism in his 1846 letter to Annenkov.</p><p class="s8">The other part enlarged in greatest measure is Part II (“The Critique of Capitalism”), featuring Marx’s economic writings. The chief innovation is the inclusion of extensive extracts from the <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span>, including the whole of its introductory part. Additions have been made to Volume One of <span class="c1">Capital</span>: the section on the “Industrial Reserve Army” and the chapters on “The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power” and “Modern Industry and Agriculture.” The famous unfinished concluding chapter on “Classes” has been added to the short selection from Volume Three of <span class="c1">Capital</span>, and Marx’s discussion of economic crises in his still little-known <span class="c1">Theories of Surplus Value</span> has been added for those with a specialized interest in Marxian economics. Other, brief additions to Part II are the concluding section of <span class="c1">The Poverty of Philosophy</span>, presenting Marx’s 1847 preview of the violent revolutionary breakdown of capitalist society, and Marx’s 1852 statement to Wedemeyer on what he considered his main innovation in the theory of history. <span class="c1">Wage Labour and</span> <span class="c1">Capital</span> has been preserved, although it is now given in somewhat condensed form. Engels’ revealing discussion in <span class="c1">Anti-Dühring</span> on “The Division of Labour in Production,” with added material, has been moved to Part V (“The Later Engels”).</p><p class="s8">Part III (“Revolutionary Program and Strategy”) has been enlarged by three short selections: Marx’s speech of 1872 in Amsterdam allowing for the possibility of a peaceful road to socialism in certain countries; his discussion in a letter to Bolte in 1871 of the way in which economic issues should figure in revolutionary working-class politics; and his rebuttal of Bakunin’s criticisms of Marxism (this occurs in Marx’s conspectus, written in 1874–75, of Bakunin’s work <span class="c1">Statehood and Anarchy</span>).</p><p class="s8">A classical historical pamphlet now included in Part IV (“Society and Politics in the Nineteenth Century”), Marx’s <span class="c1">The Class Struggles in France 1848–1850</span>, is represented in extracts containing its passages of general bearing and interest. The key sections of <span class="c1">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</span> and <span class="c1">The Civil War in France</span> are retained although some mainly narrative parts have been deleted. A short new section entitled “Europocentric World Revolution” presents thoughts of Marx and Engels on the problematic relation of the predicted European socialist revolution to future developments in the non-European parts of the world. Lastly, a key passage from Marx’s letter of 1881 to Vera Zasulich has been added to the selection “On Social Relations in Russia.”</p><p class="s8">The principal addition in Part V (“The Later Engels”) is material on the past, present, and future of the family from Engels’ <span class="c1">The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</span>. This material constitutes classical Marxism’s major statement on family history and the position of women. Finally, I have added material in Engels’ letters on historical materialism, including his 1894 comments to Starkenburg on the role of “great men” in history.</p><p class="s8">The book’s editorial apparatus has been, where necessary, revised and expanded. Revisions have been made in the headnotes, as needed, to make them more informative. A passage has been added to the Introduction. A “Note on Texts and Terminology” has been especially prepared for the new edition. Some minor revisions have been made in the Chronology. The Bibliographic Note has been amplified to include some new titles which have appeared in the intervening years and a listing of some books by major Marxist thinkers after Marx and Engels.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">My thanks go first of all to two friends who have been instrumental in making this book a reality. My colleague Stephen Cohen convinced me of the need for the kind of comprehensive anthology of Marx and Engels that the book seeks to provide, and later was generous with his advice on many aspects of the work and gave me the benefit of a searching appraisal of my proposed choice of materials.</p><p class="s8">I am also indebted to Emily Garlin for her editorial assistance; to Ronald Rogowski for translating Marx’s letter to Arnold Ruge; to Norman Levine for critical comments and suggestions on the choice of materials; to Steven Marcus for suggesting the inclusion of Engels’ description of working-class Manchester; to Lorna Giese for her able typing of portions of the manuscript; and to Jerome Nestor, Anthony Trenga, and Brian Kemple for help as research assistants.</p><p class="s8"> Some of the ideas embodied in the new edition have come from persons who read the book in its first edition and thoughtfully brought one or another omission or imperfection to my attention. Among those who did so and to whom I wish to express gratitude are Gert H. Muller, Caroline B. Pierce, Dennis Dalton, Gary Young, and Yasuyuki Owada. I am likewise indebted to Mihailo Markovic for his helpful advice. </p><p class="s8">Two colleagues exceptionally knowledgeable in areas covered by this book, Thomas Ferguson and Peter G. Stillman, were kind enough, in response to invitations from the publisher, to prepare searching, systematic critiques of the first edition and suggestions for additions and revisions in the second. If this volume is as improved now as I believe it to be, much of the credit goes to them, along with my deep thanks. Neither bears the responsibility for what inadequacies remain.</p><p class="s8">Unless otherwise indicated the texts are translations that have appeared in editions published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House or Progress Publishers in Moscow. Likewise, the editorial notes, save where specifically indicated, are those supplied by the original editor or translator.</p><p class="s9" id="calibre_pb_0">ROBERT C.
