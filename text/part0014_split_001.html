<p class="s8">No. 60 of <span class="c1">Vorwärts</span> contains an article headed “Der König von Preussen und die Sozialreform,” signed <span class="c1">“A Prussian.”</span></p><p class="s8">First of all this alleged Prussian sets out the content of the royal Prussian Cabinet order on the <span class="c1">uprising of the Silesian workers</span> and the opinion of the French newspaper <span class="c1">La Réforme</span> on the Prussian Cabinet order. The <span class="c1">Réforme</span>, he writes, considers that the King’s <span class="c1">“alarm and religious feeling”</span> are the source of the Cabinet order. It even sees in this document a <span class="c1">presentiment</span> of the great reforms which are in prospect for bourgeois society. The “Prussian” lectures the <span class="c1">Réforme</span> as follows:</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s21">The King and German society has not yet arrived at the “presentiment of their reform,” even the Silesian and Bohemian uprisings have not aroused this feeling. It is impossible to make such an <span class="c1">unpolitical</span> country as Germany regard the <span class="c1">partial</span> distress of the factory districts as a matter of general concern, let alone as an affliction of the whole civilised world. The Germans regard this event as if it were of the same nature as any <span class="c1">local</span> distress due to flood or famine. Hence the King regards it as due to <span class="c1">deficiencies in the administration</span> or <span class="c1">in charitable activity</span>. For this reason, and because a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers, the destruction of factories and machinery, too, did not inspire any “alarm” either in the King or the authorities. Indeed, the Cabinet order was not prompted even by <span class="c1">religious feeling:</span> it is a very sober expression of the Christian art of statesmanship and of a doctrine which considers that no difficulties can withstand its sole medicine—“the well-disposed Christian hearts.” Poverty and crime are two great evils; who can cure them? The state and the authorities? No, but the union of all Christian hearts can.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The alleged Prussian denies the King’s <span class="c1">“alarm”</span> on the grounds, among others, that a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers.</p><p class="s8">Therefore, in a country where ceremonial dinners with liberal toasts and liberally foaming champagne—recall the Düsseldorf festival—inspired a royal Cabinet order;<a id="footnote-ref152" href="part0057.html#footnote152" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">152</sup></span></a> where not a <span class="c1">single</span> soldier was needed to shatter the desires of the <span class="c1">entire</span> liberal bourgeoisie for freedom of the press and a constitution; in a country where passive obedience is the order of the day—can it be that in such a country the necessity to employ armed force against feeble weavers is <span class="c1">not an event</span>, and not an <span class="c1">alarming</span> event? Moreover, at the first encounter the feeble weavers were victorious. They were suppressed only by subsequent troop reinforcements. Is the uprising of a body of workers less dangerous because it did not require a whole army to suppress it? Let the wise Prussian compare the uprising of the Silesian weavers with the revolts of the English workers, and the Silesian weavers will be seen by him to be strong weavers.</p><p class="s8">Starting out from the <span class="c1">general</span> relation of <span class="c1">politic</span>s to <span class="c1">social ills,</span> we shall show why the uprising of the weavers could not cause the King any special <span class="c1">“alarm.”</span> For the time being we shall say only the following: the uprising was not aimed directly against the King of Prussia, but against the bourgeoisie. As an aristocrat and absolute monarch, the King of Prussia cannot love the bourgeoisie; still less can he be alarmed if the submissiveness and impotence of the bourgeoisie is increased because of a tense and difficult relationship between it and the proletariat. Further: the orthodox Catholic is more hostile to the orthodox Protestant than to the atheist, just as the Legitimist more hostile to the liberal than to the Communist. This is not because the atheist and the Communist are more akin to the Catholic or Legitimist, but because they are more foreign to him than are the Protestant and the liberal, being <span class="c1">outside</span> his circle. In the sphere of politics, the King of Prussia, as a politician, has his direct opposite in liberalism. For the King, the proletariat is as little an antithesis as the King is for the proletariat. The proletariat would have to have already attained considerable power for it to stifle the other antipathies and political antitheses and to divert to itself all political enmity. Finally: in view of the well-known character of the King, avid for anything <span class="c1">interesting</span> and <span class="c1">significant</span>, it must have been a joyful surprise for him to discover this <span class="c1">“interesting”</span> and <span class="c1">“much discussed”</span> <span class="c1">pauperism</span> in his own territory and consequently a new opportunity for making people talk about him. How pleasant for him must have been the news that henceforth he possesses his <span class="c1">“own,”</span> royal Prussian <span class="c1">pauperism!</span></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Let us suppose * * * that the “Prussian’s” remarks about the German Government and the German bourgeoisie—after all, the latter is included in “German society”—are entirely well founded. Is this section of society more at a loss in Germany than in England and France? Can one be more at a loss than, for example, in England, where <span class="c1">perplexity</span> has been made into a system? When today workers’ revolts break out throughout England, the bourgeoisie and government there know no better what to do than in the fast third of the eighteenth century. Their sole expedient is material force, and since this material force diminishes in the same proportion as the spread of pauperism and the understanding of the proletariat increase, England’s perplexity inevitably grows in geometrical progression.</p><p class="s8">Finally, it is <span class="c1">untrue, actually untrue</span>, that the German bourgeoisie totally fails to understand the general significance of the Silesian uprising. In several towns the masters are trying to act jointly with the apprentices. All the <span class="c1">liberal</span> German newspapers, the organs of the liberal bourgeoisie, teem with articles about the organisation of labour, the reform of society, criticism of monopolies and competition, etc. All this is the result of the movements among the workers. * * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Let us pass now to the oracular pronouncements of the “Prussian” on the <span class="c1">German workers</span>. <span class="c1">“The German poor,”</span> he says wittily, <span class="c1">“are no wiser than the poor Germans,</span> i.e., <span class="c1">nowhere</span> do they see beyond their own hearth and home, their own factory, their own district; the whole question has <span class="c1">so far still</span> been ignored by the all penetrating <span class="c1">political soul</span>.”</p><p class="s8">In order to be able to compare the condition of the German workers with the condition of the French and English workers, the “Prussian” would have had to compare the <span class="c1">first form</span>, the <span class="c1">start</span>, of the English and French workers’ movement with the <span class="c1">German </span>movement that is <span class="c1">just beginning</span>. He failed to do so. Consequently, his arguments lead to trivialities, such as that industry in Germany is not yet so developed as in England, or that a movement at its start looks different from the movement in its subsequent progress. He wanted to speak about the <span class="c1">specific character</span> of the German workers’ movement, but he has not a word to say on this subject of his.</p><p class="s8">On the other hand, suppose the “Prussian” were to adopt the correct standpoint. He will find that <span class="c1">not one</span> of the French and English workers’ uprisings had such a <span class="c1">theoretical</span> and <span class="c1">conscious</span> character as the uprising of the Silesian weavers.</p><p class="s8">First of all, recall the <span class="c1">song of the weavers</span>,<a id="footnote-ref153" href="part0057.html#footnote153" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">153</sup></span></a> that bold <span class="c1">call</span> to struggle, in which there is not even a mention of hearth and home, factory or district, but in which the proletariat at once, in a striking, sharp, unrestrained and powerful manner, proclaims its opposition to the society of private property. The Silesian uprising <span class="c1">begins</span> precisely with what the French and English workers’ uprisings <span class="c1">end</span>, with consciousness of the nature of the proletariat. The action itself bears the stamp of this <span class="c1">superior</span> character. Not only machines, these rivals of the workers, are destroyed, but also <span class="c1">ledgers</span>, the titles to property. And while all other movements were aimed primarily only against the <span class="c1">owner of the industrial enterprise</span>, the visible enemy, this movement is at the same time directed against the banker, the hidden enemy. Finally, not a single English workers’ uprising was carried out with such courage, thought and endurance.</p><p class="s8">As for the educational level or capacity for education of the German workers in general, I call to mind <span class="c1">Weitling’s</span> brilliant writings, which as regards theory are often superior even to those of Proudhon, however much they are inferior to the latter in their execution. Where among the bourgeoisie—including its philosophers and learned writers—is to be found a book about the emancipation of the bourgeoisie—<span class="c1">political </span>emancipation—similar to Weitling’s work: <span class="c1">Garantien der Harmonie und Freiheit?</span> It is enough to compare the petty, faint-hearted mediocrity of German political literature with this <span class="c1">vehement</span> and brilliant literary debut of the German workers, it is enough to compare these gigantic <span class="c1">infant shoes</span> of the proletariat with the dwarfish, worn-out political shoes of the German bourgeoisie, and one is bound to prophesy that the <span class="c1">German Cinderella</span> will one day have the <span class="c1">figure of an athlete</span>. It has to be admitted that the German proletariat is the <span class="c1">theoretician</span> of the European proletariat, just as the English proletariat is its <span class="c1">economist</span>, and the French proletariat its <span class="c1">politician</span>. It has to be admitted that Germany is just as much <span class="c1">classically </span>destined for a <span class="c1">social</span> revolution as it is incapable of a <span class="c1">political </span>one. For, just as the impotence of the German bourgeoisie is the <span class="c1">political</span> impotence of Germany, so also the capability of the German proletariat—even apart from German theory—represents the <span class="c1">social</span> capability of Germany. The disparity between the philosophical and the political development of Germany is not an <span class="c1">anomaly</span>. It is an inevitable disparity. A philosophical people can find its corresponding practice only in socialism, hence it is only in the <span class="c1">proletariat</span> that it can find the dynamic elements of its emancipation.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Why does the “Prussian” judge the German workers so contemptuously? Because he finds that the “whole question”—namely, the question of the distressed state of the workers—has <span class="c1">“so far still”</span> been ignored by the “all-penetrating <span class="c1">political</span> soul.” He expounds his platonic love for the <span class="c1">political soul</span> in more detail as follows: “All uprisings which break out in this disastrous <span class="c1">isolation of people from the community</span>, and of their <span class="c1">thoughts from social principles</span>, will be smothered in blood and incomprehension; but when distress produces understanding, and the <span class="c1">political</span> understanding of the Germans discovers the roots of social distress, then in Germany too these events will be appreciated as symptoms of a great revolution.”</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">That <span class="c1">social distress</span> produces <span class="c1">political</span> understanding is so incorrect that, on the contrary, what is correct is the opposite: <span class="c1">social well-being</span> produces <span class="c1">political</span> understanding. <span class="c1">Political</span> understanding is a spiritualist, and is given to him who already has, to him who is already comfortably situated. Let our “Prussian” listen to a French economist, M. <span class="c1">Michel Chevalier</span>, on this subject: “When the bourgeoisie rose up in 1789, it lacked—in order to be free—only participation in governing the country. Emancipation consisted for it in wresting the control of public affairs, the principal civil, military and religious functions, from the hands of the privileged who had the monopoly of these functions. <span class="c1">Rich</span> and <span class="c1">enlightened</span>, capable of being self-sufficient and of managing its own affairs, it wanted to escape from the system of arbitrary rule.”<a id="footnote-ref154" href="part0057.html#footnote154" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">154</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> We have already shown the “Prussian” how incapable <span class="c1">political</span> understanding is of discovering the source of social distress. Just <span class="c1">one</span> word more on this view of his. The more developed and universal the <span class="c1">political</span> understanding of a people, the more does the <span class="c1">proletariat</span>—at any rate at the beginning of the movement—squander its forces in senseless, useless revolts, which are drowned in blood. Because it thinks in the framework of politics, the proletariat sees the cause of all evils in the <span class="c1">will</span>, and all means of remedy in <span class="c1">violence </span>and in the <span class="c1">overthrow </span>of a <span class="c1">particular</span> form of state. The proof: the first uprisings of the French proletariat.<a id="footnote-ref155" href="part0057.html#footnote155" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">155</sup></span></a> The Lyons workers believed that they were pursuing only political aims, that they were only soldiers of the republic, whereas actually they were soldiers of socialism. Thus their political understanding concealed from them the roots of social distress, thus it falsified their insight into their real aim, thus their <span class="c1">political understanding deceived</span> their <span class="c1">social instinct</span>.</p><p class="s8">But if the “Prussian” expects understanding to be produced by distress, why does he lump together <span class="c1">“smothering in blood”</span> and <span class="c1">“smothering in incomprehension”?</span> If distress is in general means of producing understanding, then <span class="c1">bloody</span> distress is even a <span class="c1">very acute</span> means to this end. The “Prussian” therefore should have said: smothering in blood will smother incomprehension and procure a proper current of air for the understanding.</p><p class="s8">The “Prussian” prophesies the smothering of uprisings which break out in <span class="c1">“disastrous isolation of people from the community</span>, and in the <span class="c1">separation of their thoughts from social principles.”</span></p><p class="s8">We have shown that the Silesian uprising occurred by no means in circumstances of the separation of thoughts from social principles. It only remains for us to deal with the <span class="c1">“disastrous isolation of people from the community.”</span> By community here is meant the <span class="c1">political community</span>, the <span class="c1">state</span>. This is the old story about <span class="c1">unpolitical</span> Germany.</p><p class="s8">But do not <span class="c1">all </span>uprisings, without exception, break out in a <span class="c1">disastrous isolation of man from the community?</span> Does not <span class="c1">every</span> uprising necessarily presuppose isolation? Would the 1789 revolution have taken place without the disastrous isolation of French citizens from the community? It was intended precisely to abolish this isolation.</p><p class="s8">But the <span class="c1">community</span> from which the worker is <span class="c1">isolated</span> is a community the real character and scope of which is quite different from that of the <span class="c1">political </span>community. The community from which the worker is isolated by <span class="c1">his own labour</span> is <span class="c1">life </span>itself, physical and mental life, human morality, human activity, human enjoyment, <span class="c1">human</span> nature. <span class="c1">Human nature</span> is the <span class="c1">true community</span> of men. The disastrous isolation from this essential nature is incomparably more universal, more intolerable, more dreadful, and more contradictory, than isolation from the political community. Hence, too, the <span class="c1">abolition </span>of this isolation—and even a partial reaction to it, an <span class="c1">uprising</span> against it—is just as much more infinite as <span class="c1">man</span> is more infinite than the <span class="c1">citizen</span>, and <span class="c1">human life</span> more infinite than <span class="c1">political life</span>. Therefore, however <span class="c1">partial</span> the uprising of the <span class="c1">industrial</span> workers may be, it contains within itself a <span class="c1">universal </span>soul; however universal a <span class="c1">political</span> uprising may be, it conceals even in its <span class="c1">most grandiose</span> form a <span class="c1">narrow-minded</span> spirit. </p><p class="s8">The “Prussian” worthily concludes his article with the following sentence: <span class="c1">“A social revolution without a political soul</span> (i.e., without an organising idea from the point of view of the whole) is impossible.”</p><p class="s8">We have already seen that a <span class="c1">social</span> revolution is found to have the point of view of the <span class="c1">whole</span> because—even if it were to occur in only one factory district—it represents man’s protest against a dehumanised life, because it starts out from the <span class="c1">point of view of a separate real individual</span>, because the <span class="c1">community,</span> against the separation of which from himself the individual reacts, is man’s <span class="c1">true</span> community, <span class="c1">human</span> nature. The <span class="c1">political soul</span> of revolution, on the other hand, consists in the <span class="c1">tendency </span>of classes having no political influence to abolish their <span class="c1">isolation</span> from <span class="c1">statehood</span> and <span class="c1">rule</span>. Its point of view is that of the state, of an <span class="c1">abstract</span> whole, which exists only through <span class="c1">separation</span> from real life, and which is <span class="c1">inconceivable </span>without the <span class="c1">organised</span> contradiction between the universal idea of man and the individual existence of man. Hence, too, a revolution with a <span class="c1">political soul</span>, in accordance with the <span class="c1">limited</span> and <span class="c1">dichotomous</span> nature of this soul, organises a ruling stratum in society at the expense of society itself.</p><p class="s8">We want to divulge to the “Prussian” what <span class="c1">“social revolution</span> with a <span class="c1">political soul”</span> actually is; we shall thereby at the same time confide the secret to him that he himself is unable, even in <span class="c1">words,</span> to rise above the narrow-minded political point of view.</p><p class="s8">A <span class="c1">“social”</span> revolution with a <span class="c1">political</span> soul is either a nonsensical concoction, if by “social” revolution the “Prussian” means a “social” as <span class="c1">opposed</span> to a political revolution, and nevertheless endows the social revolution with a political soul instead of a social one; or else a <span class="c1">“social revolution with a political soul”</span> is only a <span class="c1">paraphrase</span> for what was usually called a <span class="c1">“political revolution,”</span> or <span class="c1">“simply a revolution.”</span> Every revolution dissolves the <span class="c1">old society</span> and to that extent it is <span class="c1">social</span>. Every revolution overthrows <span class="c1">the old power</span> and to that extent it <span class="c1">is political</span>.</p><p class="s8">Let the “Prussian” choose between the <span class="c1">paraphrase</span> and the <span class="c1">nonsense!</span> But whereas a <span class="c1">social revolution</span> with a <span class="c1">political soul</span> is a paraphrase or nonsense, a <span class="c1">political revolution</span> with a <span class="c1">social</span> soul has a rational meaning. <span class="c1">Revolution</span> in general—the <span class="c1">overthrow</span> of the existing power and <span class="c1">dissolution</span> of the old relationships—is a <span class="c1">political act</span>. But <span class="c1">socialism</span> cannot be realised without <span class="c1">revolution</span>. It needs this <span class="c1">political </span>act insofar as it needs <span class="c1">destruction</span> and <span class="c1">dissolution</span>. But where its <span class="c1">organising activity</span> begins, where its <span class="c1">proper object</span>, its <span class="c1">soul</span>, comes to the fore—there socialism throws off the <span class="c1">political</span> cloak.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s25" id="calibre_pb_2">* * *</p>
