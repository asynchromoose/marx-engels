He remained in England for nearly two years and while there gathered material for his first book, <span class="c1">The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844</span>, which was published in German in 1845. The extract below, from the chapter on “The Great Towns,” is taken from the English translation published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in 1962.</p>
