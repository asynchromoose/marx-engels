Both men prepared first drafts. Engels’ draft, preserved under the title “The Principles of Communism,” was in the form of a catechism with twenty-five questions and answers. Marx is believed to have had the greater hand in giving the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span> its final form as both a programmatic statement and a compressed summary of the Marxian theory of history. It was originally published in London in February, 1848, and brought out in a French translation in Paris shortly before the insurrection of June, 1848, there. It has become the most widely read and influential single document of modern socialism. The text given here is that of the English edition of 1888, edited by Engels.</p>
