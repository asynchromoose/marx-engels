<p class="s33">F. Population, Overpopulation, and Malthus</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Malthus’s theory, which incidentally was not his invention, but whose fame he appropriated through the clerical fanaticism with which he propounded it—actually only through the weight he placed on it—is significant in two respects: (1) because he gives brutal expression to the brutal viewpoint of capital; (2) because he <span class="c1">asserted</span> the fact of overpopulation in all forms of society. Proved it he has not, for there is nothing more uncritical than his motley compilations from historians and travellers’ descriptions. His conception is altogether false and childish (1) because he regards <span class="c1">overpopulation</span> as being <span class="c1">of the same kind</span> in all the different historic phases of economic development; does not understand their specific difference, and hence stupidly reduces these very complicated and varying relations to a single relation, two equations, in which the natural reproduction of humanity appears on the one side, and the natural reproduction of edible plants (or means of subsistence) on the other, as two natural series, the former geometric and the latter arithmetic in progression. In this way he transforms the historically distinct relations into an abstract numerical relation, which he has fished purely out of thin air, and which rests neither on natural nor on historical laws. There is allegedly a natural difference between the reproduction of mankind and e.g. grain. This baboon thereby implies that the <span class="c1">increase of humanity</span> is a purely natural process, which requires <span class="c1">external restraints, checks,</span> to prevent it from proceeding in geometrical progression. This <span class="c1">geometrical reproduction</span> is the natural reproduction process of mankind. He would find in history that population proceeds in very different relations, and that overpopulation is likewise a historically determined relation, in no way determined by abstract numbers or by the absolute limit of the productivity of the necessaries of life, but by limits posited rather by <span class="c1">specific conditions of production</span>. As well as restricted numerically. How small do the numbers which meant overpopulation for the Athenians appear to us! Secondly, restricted according to character. An overpopulation of free Athenians who become transformed into colonists is significantly different from an overpopulation of workers who become transformed into workhouse inmates. Similarly the begging overpopulation which consumes the surplus produce of a monastery is different from that which forms in a factory. It is Malthus who abstracts from these specific historic laws of the movement of population, which are indeed the history of the nature of humanity, the <span class="c1">natural</span> laws, but natural laws of humanity only at a specific historic development, with a development of the forces of production determined by humanity’s own process of history. Malthusian man, abstracted from historically determined man, exists only in his brain; hence also the geometric method of reproduction corresponding to this natural Malthusian man. Real history thus appears to him in such a way that the reproduction of his natural humanity is not an abstraction from the historic process of real reproduction, but just the contrary, that real reproduction is an application of the Malthusian theory. Hence the inherent conditions of population as well as of overpopulation at every stage of history appear to him as a series of <span class="c1">external checks</span> which has <span class="c1">prevented</span> the population from developing in the Malthusian form. The conditions in which mankind historically produces and reproduces itself appear as <span class="c1">barriers</span> to the reproduction of the Malthusian natural man, who is a Malthusian creature. On the other hand, the production of the necessaries of life—as it is checked, determined by human action—appears as a check which it posits to itself. The ferns would cover the entire earth. Their reproduction would stop only where space for them ceased. They would obey no arithmetic proportion. It is hard to say where Malthus has discovered that the reproduction of voluntary natural products would stop for intrinsic reasons, without <span class="c1">external checks</span>. He transforms the immanent, historically changing limits of the human reproduction process <span class="c1">into outer barriers;</span> and the <span class="c1">outer barriers</span> to natural reproduction into <span class="c1">immanent limits</span> or <span class="c1">natural laws</span> of reproduction.</p><p class="s8">(2) He stupidly relates a specific quantity of people to a specific quantity of necessaries.<a id="footnote-ref238" href="part0057.html#footnote238" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">238</sup></span></a> Ricardo immediately and correctly confronted him with the fact that the quantity of grain available is completely irrelevant to the worker if he has no <span class="c1">employment;</span> that it is therefore the means of employment and not of subsistence which put him into the category of surplus populations.<a id="footnote-ref239" href="part0057.html#footnote239" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">239</sup></span></a> But this should be conceived more generally, and relates to the <span class="c1">social mediation</span> as such, through which the individual gains access to the means of his reproduction and creates them; hence it relates to the <span class="c1">conditions of production</span> and his relation to them. There was no barrier to the reproduction of the Athenian slave other than the producible necessaries. And we never hear that there were <span class="c1">surplus slaves</span> in antiquity. The call for them increased, rather. There was, however, a surplus population of non-workers (in the immediate sense), who were not too many in relation to the necessaries available, but who had lost the conditions under which they could appropriate them. The invention of surplus labourers, i.e. of propertyless people who work, belongs to the period of capital. The beggars who fastened themselves to the monasteries and helped them eat up their surplus product are in the same class as the feudal retainers, and this shows that the surplus produce could not be eaten up by the small number of its owners. It is only another form of the retainers of old, or of the menial servants of today. The overpopulation e.g. among hunting peoples, which shows itself in the warfare between the tribes, proves not that the earth could not support their small numbers, but rather that the condition of their reproduction required a great amount of territory for few people. Never a relation to a <span class="c1">non-existent</span> absolute mass of means of subsistence, but rather relation to the conditions of reproduction of the production of these means, including likewise the <span class="c1">conditions of reproduction of human beings</span>, of the total population, of relative surplus population. This surplus purely relative: in no way related to the <span class="c1">means of subsistence as</span> such, but rather to the mode of producing them. Hence also only a <span class="c1">surplus</span> at this state of development.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s25" id="calibre_pb_12">* * *</p>
