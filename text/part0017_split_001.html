<p class="s20">I</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism—that of Feuerbach included—is that the thing, reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the object or of <span class="c1">contemplation</span>, but not as <span class="c1">human sensuous activity, practice,</span> not subjectively. Hence it happened that the <span class="c1">active</span> side, in contradistinction to materialism, was developed by idealism—but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such. Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, really distinct from the thought objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as <span class="c1">objective</span> activity. Hence, in <span class="c1">Das Wesen des Christentums</span>, he regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice is conceived and fixed only in its dirty-judaical manifestation. Hence he does not grasp the significance of “revolutionary,” of practical-critical, activity.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">II</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a <span class="c1">practical</span> question. Man must prove the truth, that is, the reality and power, the this-sidedness of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely <span class="c1">scholastic</span> question.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">III</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that it is essential to educate the educator himself. Hence, this doctrine necessarily arrives at dividing society into two parts, one of which is superior to society.</p><p class="s8">The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionising practice.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">IV</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> Feuerbach starts out from the fact of religious self-alienation, of the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world and a real one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done. For the fact that the secular basis detaches itself from itself and establishes itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the cleavage and self-contradictions within this secular basis. The latter must itself, therefore, first be understood in its contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised in practice. Thus, for instance, after the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must then itself be criticised in theory and revolutionised in practice. </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">V</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Feuerbach, not satisfied with <span class="c1">abstract thinking</span>, appeals to <span class="c1">sensuous contemplation;</span> but he does not conceive sensuousness as practical, human-sensuous activity.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">VI </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Feuerbach resolves the religious essence into the human essence. But the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations.</p><p class="s8">Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence, is consequently compelled:</p><p class="s8">(I) To abstract from the historical process and to fix the religious sentiment as something by itself and to presuppose an abstract—<span class="c1">isolated</span>—human individual.</p><p class="s8">(2) The human essence, therefore, can with him be comprehended only as “genus,” as an internal, dumb generality which merely <span class="c1">naturally </span>unites the many individuals.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">VII </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Feuerbach, consequently, does not see that the “religious sentiment” is itself a social product, and that the abstract individual whom he analyses belongs in reality to a particular form of society.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">VIII</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Social life is essentially <span class="c1">practical</span>. All mysteries which mislead theory into mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">IX</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The highest point attained by contemplative materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, is the contemplation of single individuals in civil society.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">X</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The standpoint of the old materialism is <span class="c1">“civil”</span> society; the standpoint of the new is <span class="c1">human </span>society, or socialised humanity.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">XI</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">The philosophers have only <span class="c1">interpreted</span> the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to <span class="c1">change</span> it.</p>
