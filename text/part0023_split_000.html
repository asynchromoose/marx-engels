  <body class="calibre"><div class="body"><span id="chapter-23" class="c"></span><p class="s7">The Grundrisse</p><p class="s26">KARL MARX</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Comprising seven notebooks written in 1857–58, this preparatory effort by Marx to put together the results of his economic studies was first published by the Institute of Marx-Engels-Lenin in Moscow in 1939–41 as <span class="c1">Foundations (Grundrisse) of the Critique of Political Economy</span>. In recent years it has attracted growing attention because of the intrinsic interest of various parts, because it forms an important link between the early writings and <span class="c1">Capital</span>, and because the very rawness of much of the text enhances its value as a revelation of Marx’s creative mental process.<a id="footnote-ref203" href="part0057.html#footnote203" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">203</sup></span></a> The great bulk of it consists of an Introduction, a “Chapter on Money,” and a “Chapter on Capital.” The Introduction, which appears here in full, and several selections from the “Chapter on Capital” have been chosen partly for what they add to the study of <span class="c1">Capital</span>. The reader not yet familiar with the basic argument of <span class="c1">Capital</span> may therefore prefer to turn first to that work, below, and then return to the <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span>.</p><p class="s8">The Introduction, besides stating Marx’s view of the method of political economy, develops his thesis on production as the basic category; shows (in the final paragraph of its third section) that the work on which he was embarked, and which later came to fruition in <span class="c1">Capital</span>, was no more than one part of a more ambitious total project; and concludes with a discussion of the timeless character of great art. Section B defines “society.” Section C deals with capitalism as incessant drive for surplus value and alludes to future communism as a society in which labour “appears no longer as labour, but as the full development of activity itself . . .” Section D supplements <span class="c1">Capital</span> on primitive accumulation. Section E deals with pre-capitalist economies and the birth of capitalism. Section F summarizes Marx’s views on population and Malthus. Section G contains a now-famous discussion of ever-increasing automation under capitalism.<a id="footnote-ref204" href="part0057.html#footnote204" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">204</sup></span></a> Section H envisages capitalism’s ultimate violent overthrow. Section I contrasts the alienation of labour under capitalism with the postulated ending of alienation in the future. In these and other passages of the <span class="c1">Grundrisse</span> Marx here and there uses the “alienation” terminology which had been pervasive in the 1844 manuscripts but would grow inconspicuous in <span class="c1">Capital.</span></p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The translation and footnotes are by Martin Nicolaus. The capitalized letters and section headings following the Introduction have been added by the editor of this reader.</p>
