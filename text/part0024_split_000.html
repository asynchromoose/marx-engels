Volume One, published in 1867, is the book generally referred to simply as <span class="c1">Capital</span> and is relatively complete in itself.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The following selections from it, together with Marx’s Preface to the first German edition, Afterword to the second, and Preface to the French edition, are taken from the text of the English edition of 1887, as translated from the third German edition by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling and edited by Engels. An attempt has been made here to provide those sections of the book that collectively convey the basic argument and the most characteristic themes. In some instances Marx’s footnotes have been deleted in the interest of saving space.</p>
