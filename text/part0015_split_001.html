<p class="s8">* * * The proletariat and wealth are opposites. As such they form a whole. They are both products of the world of private property. The whole question is what position each of these two elements occupies within the opposition. It does not suffice to proclaim them two sides of one whole.</p><p class="s8">Private property as private property, as wealth, is compelled to preserve <span class="c1">its own existence</span> and thereby the existence of its opposite, the proletariat. This is the <span class="c1">positive</span> side of the antagonism, private property satisfied with itself.</p><p class="s8">The proletariat, on the other hand, is compelled to abolish<a id="footnote-ref156" href="part0057.html#footnote156" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">156</sup></span></a> itself and thereby its conditioning opposite—private property—which makes it a proletariat. This is the <span class="c1">negative</span> side of the antagonism, its disturbance within itself, private property abolished and in the process of abolishing itself.</p><p class="s8">The possessing class and the proletarian class represent one and the same human self-alienation.<a id="footnote-ref157" href="part0057.html#footnote157" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">157</sup></span></a> But the former feels satisfied and affirmed in this self-alienation, experiences the alienation as a sign <span class="c1">of its own power</span>, and possesses in it the <span class="c1">appearance</span> of a human existence. The latter, however, feels destroyed in this alienation, seeing in it its own impotence and the reality of an inhuman existence. To use Hegel’s expression, this class is, within depravity, an <span class="c1">indignation</span> against this depravity, an indignation necessarily aroused in this class by the contradiction between its human <span class="c1">nature</span> and its life-situation, which is a blatant, outright and all-embracing denial of that very nature.</p><p class="s8">Within the antagonism as a whole, therefore, private property represents the <span class="c1">conservative</span> side and the proletariat the <span class="c1">destructive</span> side. From the former comes action aimed at preserving the antagonism; from the latter, action aimed at its destruction.</p><p class="s8">In its economic movement, it is true, private property presses towards its own dissolution, but it does this only by means of a developmental course that is unconscious and takes place independently of it and against its will, a course determined by the nature of the thing itself. It does this only by giving rise to the proletariat <span class="c1">as</span> proletariat—this poverty conscious of its own spiritual and physical poverty, this dehumanization which is conscious of itself as a dehumanization and hence abolishes itself.<a id="footnote-ref158" href="part0057.html#footnote158" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">158</sup></span></a> The proletariat executes the sentence that proletariat-producing private property passes upon itself, just as it executes the sentence that wage labour passes upon itself by producing others wealth and its own poverty. When the proletariat wins victory, it by no means becomes the absolute side of society, for it wins victory only by abolishing itself and its opposite. Both the proletariat itself and its conditioning opposite—private property—disappear with the victory of the proletariat.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">If socialist writers attribute this world-historical role to the proletariat, this is by no means, as critical criticism assures us, because they regard the proletarians as <span class="c1">gods</span>. On the contrary. Since the fully formed proletariat represents, practically speaking, the completed abstraction from everything human, even from the <span class="c1">appearance</span> of being human; since all the living conditions of contemporary society have reached the acme of inhumanity in the living conditions of the proletariat; since in the proletariat man has lost himself, although at the same time he has both acquired a theoretical consciousness of this loss and has been directly forced into indignation against this inhumanity by virtue of an inexorable, utterly unembellishable, absolutely imperious <span class="c1">need</span>, that practical expression of <span class="c1">necessity</span>—because of all this the proletariat itself can and must liberate itself. But it cannot liberate itself without destroying its own living conditions. It cannot do so without destroying all the inhuman living conditions of contemporary society which are concentrated in its own situation. Not in vain does it go through the harsh but hardening school of <span class="c1">labour</span>. It is not a matter of what this or that proletarian or even the proletariat as a whole <span class="c1">pictures</span> at present as its goal. It is a matter of <span class="c1">what the proletariat is in actuality</span> and what, in accordance with this <span class="c1">being</span>, it will historically be compelled to do. Its goal and its historical action are prefigured in the most clear and ineluctable way in its own life-situation as well as in the whole organization of contemporary bourgeois society. There is no need to harp on the fact that a large part of the English and French proletariat is already <span class="c1">conscious</span> of its historic task and is continually working to bring this consciousness to full clarity.</p>
