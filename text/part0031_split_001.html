<p class="s8">* * * The political movement of the working class has as its ultimate object, of course, the conquest of political power for this class, and this naturally requires a previous organisation of the working class developed up to a certain point and arising precisely from its economic struggles.</p><p class="s8">On the other hand, however, every movement in which the working class comes out as a class against the ruling classes and tries to coerce them by pressure from without is a political movement. For instance, the attempt in a particular factory or even in a particular trade to force a shorter working day out of individual capitalists by strikes, etc., is a purely economic movement. On the other hand, the movement to force through an eight-hour, etc., <span class="c1">law</span> is a <span class="c1">political </span>movement. And in this way out of the separate economic movements of the workers there grows up everywhere a political movement, that is to say, a movement of the <span class="c1">class</span>, with the object of enforcing its interests in a general form, in a form possessing general, socially coercive force. While these movements presuppose a certain degree of previous organization, they are in turn equally a means of developing this organization. </p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">Where the working class, is not yet far enough advanced in its organization to undertake a decisive campaign against the collective power, i.e<span class="c1">.</span>, the political power of the ruling classes, it must at any rate be trained for this by continual agitation against this power and by a hostile attitude toward the policies of the ruling classes.</p>
