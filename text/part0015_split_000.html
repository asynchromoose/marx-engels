Their first jointly written work, published in 1845, was <span class="c1">The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism,</span> a heavily satirical polemic against Bruno Bauer and the Young Hegelians. The following passage, probably written by Marx, shows the alienation doctrine of the 1844 manuscripts merging into the class struggle doctrine as we encounter it in <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> and later Marxist writings. It is also of value as a revelation of Marx’s special way of conceiving and explaining historical necessity.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The translation for this edition is by R. C. Tucker.</p>
