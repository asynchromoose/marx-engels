  <body class="calibre"><div class="body"><span id="chapter-56" class="c"></span><p class="s7">Bibliographic Note</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The literature on classical Marxism and its founders is very large and constantly growing. Many new studies have appeared in recent years as a result of the discovery of the early Marx and the controversy over the place of “original Marxism” in the development of Marx’s thought and, more broadly, in intellectual history. This note makes no pretense to being an exhaustive guide even to the books available in English on classical Marxism. It is a small personal selection of studies that may be useful for further reading. The final part lists some works by major Marxist thinkers after Marx and Engels. (Books marked with an asterisk are available as paperbacks; the name of the paperback publisher is given in parentheses.) </p>
