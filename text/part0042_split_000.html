In a preface to the second edition, he himself said it was the intention of the work to “demonstrate how the <span class="c1">class struggle</span> in France created circumstances and relationships that made it possible for a grotesque mediocrity to play a hero’s part.” Since Louis Bonaparte’s rise and rule have been seen as a forerunner of the phenomenon that was to become known in the twentieth century as fascism, Marx’s interpretation of it is of interest, among other ways, as a sort of prologue to later Marxist thought on the nature and meaning of fascism.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0"><span class="c1">The Eighteenth Brumaire</span> was written by Marx in late 1851 and early 1852, and originally appeared in 1852 in a magazine entitled <span class="c1">Die Revolution</span>, published in New York. The most important sections—the first and the last—appear here.</p>
