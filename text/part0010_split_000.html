He set about this by working on a commentary on Hegel’s treatise on the state.<a id="footnote-ref44" href="part0057.html#footnote44" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">44</sup></span></a> To the Hegelian political philosophy (which he called, following Feuerbach, “speculative philosophy”) he applied the method of “transformational criticism” that Feuerbach had applied to the Hegelian philosophy of religion.<a id="footnote-ref45" href="part0057.html#footnote45" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">45</sup></span></a> Although the work was left incomplete and unpublished, it was, as Marx later said (see p. 4, above), a milestone on his road to historical materialism: it led him to the view that instead of the state being the basis of “civil society,” as Hegel held, civil or bourgeois society is the basis of the state.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">Despite its incompleteness—the extant part of the commentary starts with paragraph 261 of Hegel’s treatise and deals only with selected further sections up to paragraph 308—this work remains of interest as Marx’s most extensive single piece of purely political writing, although his standpoint at the time of writing was no more than proto-Marxist.</p>
