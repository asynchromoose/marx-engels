At the request of his friend Paul Lafargue, Engels arranged three general chapters of <span class="c1">Anti-Dührung</span> as a pamphlet dealing with the origins of Marxism and summarizing its view of history. Originally published in French in 1880, <span class="c1">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</span> soon appeared in many other languages and became, along with the <span class="c1">Communist Manifesto</span>, the most influential popular presentation of the Marxist position in the late nineteenth century. The text given here is that of the authorized English edition of 1892.</p>
