<p class="s33">The Meaning of Human Requirements</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">We have seen what significance, given socialism, the <span class="c1">wealth</span> of human needs has, and what significance, therefore, both a <span class="c1">new mode of production</span> and a new <span class="c1">object</span> of production have: a new manifestation of the forces of <span class="c1">human</span> nature and a new enrichment of <span class="c1">human</span> nature.<a id="footnote-ref120" href="part0057.html#footnote120" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">120</sup></span></a> Under private property their significance is reversed: every person speculates on creating a new <span class="c1">need</span> in another, so as to drive him to a fresh sacrifice, to place him in a new dependence and to seduce him into a new mode of <span class="c1">gratification</span> and therefore economic ruin. Each tries to establish over the other an <span class="c1">alien</span> power, so as thereby to find satisfaction of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new <span class="c1">potency</span> of mutual swindling and mutual plundering. Man becomes ever poorer as man; his need for <span class="c1">money</span> becomes ever greater if he wants to overpower hostile being; and the power of his <span class="c1">money</span> declines exactly in inverse proportion to the increase in the volume of production: that is, his neediness grows as the <span class="c1">power</span> of money increases.</p><p class="s8">The need for money is therefore the true need produced by the modern economic system, and it is the only need which the latter produces. The <span class="c1">quantity</span> of money becomes to an ever greater degree its sole <span class="c1">effective</span> attribute: just as it reduces everything to its abstract form, so it reduces itself in the course of its own movement to something merely <span class="c1">quantitative</span>. Excess and <span class="c1">intemperance</span> come to be its true norm. Subjectively, this is even partly manifested in that the extension of products and needs falls into <span class="c1">contriving</span> and ever-calculating subservience to inhuman, refined, unnatural and <span class="c1">imaginary</span> appetites. Private property does not know how to change crude need into <span class="c1">human</span> need. Its <span class="c1">idealism</span> <span class="c1">is fantasy, caprice</span> and <span class="c1">whim;</span> and no eunuch flatters his despot more basely or uses more despicable means to stimulate his dulled capacity for pleasure in order to sneak a favour for himself than does the industrial eunuch—the producer—in order to sneak for himself a few pennies—in order to charm the golden birds out of the pockets of his Christianly beloved neighbours. He puts himself at the service of the other’s most depraved fancies, plays the pimp between him and his need, excites in him morbid appetites, lies in wait for each of his weaknesses—all so that he can then demand the cash for this service of love. (Every product is a bait with which to seduce away the other’s very being, his money; every real and possible need is a weakness which will lead the fly to the gluepot. General exploitation of communal human nature, just as every imperfection in man, is a bond with heaven—an avenue giving the priest access to his heart; every need is an opportunity to approach one’s neighbour under the guise of the utmost amiability and to say to him: Dear friend, I give you what you need, but you know the <span class="c1">conditio sine qua non;</span> you know the ink in which you have to sign yourself over to me; in providing for your pleasure, I fleece you.)</p><p class="s8">And partly, this estrangement manifests itself in that it produces refinement of needs and of their means on the one hand, and a bestial barbarization, a complete, unrefined, abstract simplicity of need, on the other; or rather in that it merely resurrects itself in its opposite. Even the need for fresh air ceases for the worker. Man returns to living in a cave, which is now, however, contaminated with the mephitic breath of plague given off by civilization, and which he continues to occupy only <span class="c1">precariously</span>, it being for him an alien habitation which can be withdrawn from him any day—a place from which, if he does not pay, he can be thrown out any day. For this mortuary he has to <span class="c1">pay</span>. A dwelling in the <span class="c1">light</span>, which Prometheus in Aeschylus designated as one of the greatest boons, by means of which he made the savage into a human being, ceases to exist for the worker. Light, air, etc.—the simplest <span class="c1">animal</span> cleanliness—ceases to be a need for man. Dirt—this stagnation and putrefaction of man—the <span class="c1">sewage</span> of civilization (speaking quite literally)—comes to be the <span class="c1">element of life</span> for him. Utter, <span class="c1">unnatural</span> neglect, putrefied nature, comes to be his <span class="c1">life-element</span>. None of his senses exist any longer, and not only in his human fashion, but in an <span class="c1">inhuman</span> fashion, and therefore not even in an animal fashion. The crudest <span class="c1">modes</span> (and <span class="c1">instruments</span>) of human labour are coming back: the <span class="c1">tread mill</span> of the Roman slaves, for instance, is the means of production, the means of existence, of many English workers. It is not only that man has no human needs—even his <span class="c1">animal</span> needs are ceasing to exist. The Irishman no longer knows any need now but the need to <span class="c1">eat</span>, and indeed only the need to eat <span class="c1">potatoes</span>—and <span class="c1">scabby potatoes</span> at that, the worst kind of potatoes. But in each of their industrial towns England and France have already a <span class="c1">little</span> Ireland. The savage and the animal have at least the need to hunt, to roam, etc.—the need of companionship. Machine labour is simplified in order to make a worker out of the human being still in the making, the completely immature human being, the <span class="c1">child</span>—whilst the worker has become a neglected child. The machine accommodates itself to the <span class="c1">weakness</span> of the human being in order to make the weak human being into a machine.</p><p class="s8">How the multiplication of needs and of the means of their satisfaction breeds the absence of needs and of means is demonstrated by the political economist (and the capitalist: it should be noted that it is always <span class="c1">empirical</span> business men we are talking about when we refer to political economists—their <span class="c1">scientific</span> confession and mode of being). This he shows:</p><p class="s8">(1) By reducing the worker’s need to the barest and most miserable level of physical subsistence, and by reducing his activity to the most abstract mechanical movement. Hence, he says: Man has no other need either of activity or of enjoyment. For he calls <span class="c1">even</span> this life <span class="c1">human</span> life and existence.</p><p class="s8">(2) By <span class="c1">counting</span> the <span class="c1">lowest</span> possible level of life (existence) as the standard, indeed as the general standard—general because it is applicable to the mass of men. He changes the worker into an insensible being lacking all needs, just as he changes his activity into a pure abstraction from all activity. To him, therefore, every <span class="c1">luxury</span> of the worker seems to be reprehensible, and everything that goes beyond the most abstract need—be it in the realm of passive enjoyment, or a manifestation of activity—seems to him a luxury. Political economy, this science of <span class="c1">wealth</span>, is therefore simultaneously the science of denial, of want, of <span class="c1">thrift</span>, of <span class="c1">saving</span>—and it actually reaches the point where it <span class="c1">spares</span> man the <span class="c1">need</span> of either fresh <span class="c1">air</span> or physical <span class="c1">exercise</span>. This science of marvellous industry is simultaneously the science of <span class="c1">asceticism</span>, and its true ideal is the <span class="c1">ascetic</span> but e<span class="c1">xtortionate</span> miser and the <span class="c1">ascetic</span> but <span class="c1">productive</span> slave. Its moral ideal is the <span class="c1">worker</span> who takes part of his wages to the savings bank, and it has even found ready-made an abject <span class="c1">art</span> in which to clothe this its pet idea: they have presented it, bathed in sentimentality, on the stage. Thus political economy—despite its worldly and wanton appearance—is a true moral science, the most moral of all the sciences. Self-denial, the denial of life and of all human needs, is its cardinal doctrine. The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you <span class="c1">save</span>—the <span class="c1">greater</span> becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour—your <span class="c1">capital</span>. The less you <span class="c1">are</span>, the more you <span class="c1">have;</span> the less you express your own life, the greater is your <span class="c1">alienated</span> life—the greater is the store of your estranged being. Everything which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity, he replaces for you in <span class="c1">money</span> and in <span class="c1">wealth;</span> and all the things which you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and drink, go to the dance hall and the theatre; it can travel, it can appropriate art, learning, the treasures of the past, political power—all this it <span class="c1">can</span> appropriate for you—it can buy all this for you: it is the true <span class="c1">endowment</span>. Yet being all this, it is inclined to do nothing but create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its servant. And when I have the master I have the servant and do not need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be submerged in <span class="c1">avarice</span>. The worker may only have enough for him to want to live, and may only want to live in order to have [enough].</p><p class="s8">Of course a controversy now arises in the field of political economy. The one side (Lauderdale, Malthus, etc.) recommends <span class="c1">luxury</span> and execrates thrift. The other (Say, Ricardo, etc.) recommends thrift and execrates luxury. But the former admits that it wants luxury in order to produce <span class="c1">labour</span> (i.e., absolute thrift); and the latter admits that it recommends thrift in order to produce <span class="c1">wealth</span> (i.e., luxury). The Lauderdale-Malthus school has the <span class="c1">romantic</span> notion that avarice alone ought not to determine the consumption of the rich, and it contradicts its own laws in advancing <span class="c1">extravagance</span> as a direct means of enrichment. Against it, therefore, the other side very earnestly and circumstantially proves that I do not increase but reduce my <span class="c1">possessions</span> by being extravagant. The Say-Ricardo school, however, is hypocritical in not admitting that it is precisely whim and caprice which determine production. It forgets the “refined needs”; it forgets that there would be no production without consumption; it forgets that as a result of competition production can only become more extensive and luxurious. It forgets that it is use that determines a thing’s value, and that fashion determines use. It wishes to see only “useful things” produced, but it forgets that production of too many useful things produces too large a <span class="c1">useless</span> population. Both sides forget that extravagance and thrift, luxury and privation, wealth and poverty are equal.</p><p class="s8">And you must not only stint the immediate gratification of your senses, as by stinting yourself of food, etc.: you must also spare yourself all sharing of general interest, all sympathy, all trust, etc.; if you want to be economical, if you do not want to be ruined by illusions.</p><p class="s8">You must make everything that is yours <span class="c1">saleable</span>, i.e., useful. If I ask the political economist: Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale, by surrendering it to another’s lust? (The factory workers in France call the prostitution of their wives and daughters the <span class="c1">x</span>th working hour, which is literally correct.)—Or am I not acting in keeping with political economy if I sell my friend to the Moroccans? (And the direct sale of men in the form of a trade in conscripts, etc., takes place in all civilized countries.)—Then the political economist replies to me: You do not transgress my laws; but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it. My <span class="c1">political economic</span> ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with, but—But whom am I now to believe, political economy or ethics? The ethics of political economy is <span class="c1">acquisition</span>, work, thrift, sobriety—but political economy promises to satisfy my needs. The political economy of ethics is the opulence of a good conscience, of virtue, etc.; but how can I live virtuously if I do not live? And how can I have a good conscience if I am not conscious of anything? It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yardstick—ethics one and political economy another; for each is a specific estrangement of man and focuses attention on a particular round of estranged essential activity, and each stands in an estranged relation to the other. Thus <span class="c1">Michel Chevalier</span> reproaches Ricardo with having abstracted from ethics. But Ricardo is allowing political economy to speak its own language, and if it does not speak ethically, this is not Ricardo’s fault. M. Chevalier abstracts from political economy in so far as he moralizes, but he really and necessarily abstracts from ethics in so far as he practises political economy. The reference of political economy to ethics, if it is other than an arbitrary, contingent and therefore unfounded and unscientific reference, if it is not being put up as a <span class="c1">sham</span> but is meant to be <span class="c1">essential</span>, can only be the reference of the laws of political economy to ethics. If there is no such connection, or if the contrary is rather the case, can Ricardo help it? Besides, the opposition between political economy and ethics is only a <span class="c1">sham</span> opposition and just as much no opposition as it is an opposition. All that happens is that political economy expresses moral laws <span class="c1">in its own way.</span></p><p class="s8">Needlessness as the principle of political economy is <span class="c1">most brilliantly</span> shown in its <span class="c1">theory of population</span>. There are <span class="c1">too many</span> people. Even the existence of men is a pure luxury; and if the worker is <span class="c1">“ethical,”</span> he will be <span class="c1">sparing</span> in procreation. (Mill suggests public acclaim for those who prove themselves continent in their sexual relations, and public rebuke for those who sin against such barrenness of marriage . . . Is not this the ethics, the teaching of asceticism?) The production of people appears in the form of public misery.</p><p class="s8">The meaning which production has in relation to the rich is seen <span class="c1">revealed</span> in the meaning which it has for the poor. At the top the manifestation is always refined, veiled, ambiguous—a sham; lower, it is rough, straightforward, frank—the real thing. The worker’s crude need is a far greater source of gain than the <span class="c1">refined</span> need of the rich. The cellar-dwellings in London bring more to those who let them than do the palaces; that is to say, with reference to the landlord they constitute <span class="c1">greater wealth</span>, and thus (to speak the language of political economy) greater <span class="c1">social </span>wealth.</p><p class="s8">Industry speculates on the refinement of needs, but it speculates just as much on their <span class="c1">crudeness</span>, but on their artificially produced crudeness, whose true enjoyment, therefore, is <span class="c1">self-stupefaction—</span>this <span class="c1">seeming</span> satisfaction of need—this civilization contained <span class="c1">within</span> the crude barbarism of need; the English gin-shops are therefore the <span class="c1">symbolical embodiments</span> of private property. Their <span class="c1">luxury</span> reveals the true relation of industrial luxury and wealth to man. They are therefore rightly the only Sunday pleasures of the people, dealt with at least mildly by the English police.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">We have already seen how the political economist establishes the unity of labour and capital in a variety of ways:—(1) Capital is <span class="c1">accumulated labour</span>. (2) The purpose of capital within production—partly, reproduction of capital with profit, partly, capital as raw material (material of labour), and partly, as itself a <span class="c1">working instrument</span> (the machine is capital directly equated with labour)—is <span class="c1">productive labour</span>. (3) The worker is a capital. (4) Wages belong to costs of capital. (5) In relation to the worker, labour is the reproduction of his life-capital. (6) In relation to the capitalist, labour is an aspect of his capital’s activity.</p><p class="s8">Finally, (7) the political economist postulates the original unity of capital and labour in the form of the unity of the capitalist and the worker; this is the original state of paradise. The way in which these two aspects in the form of two persons leap at each other’s throats is for the political economist a <span class="c1">contingent</span> event, and hence only to be explained by reference to external factors. (See Mill.)<a id="footnote-ref121" href="part0057.html#footnote121" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">121</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">The nations which are still dazzled by the sensuous splendour of precious metals, and are therefore still fetish-worshippers of metal money, are not yet fully developed money-nations.—Contrast of France and England. The extent to which the solution of theoretical riddles is the task of practice and effected through practice, just as true practice is the condition of a real and positive theory, is shown, for example, in <span class="c1">fetishism</span>. The sensuous consciousness of the fetish-worshipper is different from that of the Greek, because his sensuous existence is still different. The abstract enmity between sense and spirit is necessary so long as the human feeling for nature, the human sense of nature, and therefore also the <span class="c1">natural</span> sense of <span class="c1">man</span>, are not yet produced by man’s own labour.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Equality</span> is nothing but a translation of the German <span class="c1">“Ich=Ich”</span> into the French, i.e., political form. Equality as the <span class="c1">groundwork</span> of communism is its <span class="c1">political</span> justification, and it is the same as when the German justifies it by conceiving man as <span class="c1">universal self-consciousness</span>. Naturally, the transcendence of the estrangement always proceeds from that form of the estrangement which is the <span class="c1">dominant</span> power: in Germany, <span class="c1">self-consciousness;</span> in France, <span class="c1">equality</span>, because politics; in England, real, material, <span class="c1">practical</span> need taking only itself as its standard. It is from this standpoint that Proudhon is to be criticized and appreciated.</p><p class="s8">If we characterize <span class="c1">communism</span> itself because of its character as negation of the negation, as the appropriation of the human essence which mediates itself with itself through the negation of private property—as being not yet the <span class="c1">true</span>, self-originating position but rather a position originating from private property. [. . .]<a id="footnote-ref122" href="part0057.html#footnote122" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">122</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Since in that case<a id="footnote-ref123" href="part0057.html#footnote123" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">123</sup></span></a> the real estrangement of the life of man remains, and remains all the more, the more one is conscious of it as such, it may be accomplished solely by putting communism into operation.</p><p class="s8">In order to abolish the <span class="c1">idea</span> of private property, the <span class="c1">idea</span> of communism is completely sufficient. It takes <span class="c1">actual</span> communist action to abolish actual private property. History will come to it; and this movement, which in <span class="c1">theory </span>we already know to be a self-transcending movement, will constitute <span class="c1">in actual fact</span> a very severe and protracted process. But we must regard it as a real advance to have gained beforehand a consciousness of the limited character as well as of the goal of this historical movement—and a consciousness which reaches out beyond it.</p><p class="s8">When communist <span class="c1">workmen</span> associate with one another, theory, propaganda, etc., is their first end. But at the same time, as a result of this association, they acquire a new need—the need for society—and what appears as a means becomes an end. You can observe this practical process in its most splendid results whenever you see French socialist workers together. Such things as smoking, drinking, eating, etc., are no longer means of contact or means that bring together. Company, association, and conversation, which again has society as its end, are enough for them; the brotherhood of man is no mere phrase with them, but a fact of life, and the nobility of man shines upon us from their work-hardened bodies.</p><p class="s8">When political economy claims that demand and supply always balance each other, it immediately forgets that according to its own claim (theory of population) the supply of <span class="c1">people</span> always exceeds the demand, and that, therefore, in the essential result of the whole production process—the existence of man—the disparity between demand and supply gets its most striking expression.</p><p class="s8">The extent to which money, which appears as a means, constitutes true power and the sole <span class="c1">end</span>—the extent to which in general that means which gives me substance, which gives me possession of the objective substance of others, is an <span class="c1">end in itself</span>—can be clearly seen from the facts that landed property wherever land is the source of life, and <span class="c1">horse</span> and <span class="c1">sword</span> wherever these are the <span class="c1">true means of life</span>, are also acknowledged as the true political powers in life. In the middle ages a social class is emancipated as soon as it is allowed to carry the <span class="c1">sword</span>. Amongst nomadic peoples it is the <span class="c1">horse</span> which makes me a free man and a participant in the life of the community.</p><p class="s8">We have said above that man is regressing to the <span class="c1">cave dwelling</span> etc.—but that he is regressing to it in an estranged, malignant form. The savage in his cave—a natural element which freely offers itself for his use and protection—feels himself no more a stranger, or rather feels himself to be just as much at home as a <span class="c1">fish </span>in water. But the cellar-dwelling of the poor man is a hostile dwelling, “an alien, restraining power which only gives itself up to him in so far as he gives up to it his blood and sweat”—a dwelling which he cannot look upon as his own home where he might at last exclaim, “Here I am at home,” but where instead he finds himself in <span class="c1">someone else’s</span> house, in the house of a <span class="c1">stranger</span> who daily lies in wait for him and throws him out if he does not pay his rent. Similarly, he is also aware of the contrast in quality between his dwelling and a human dwelling—a residence in that <span class="c1">other</span> world, the heaven of wealth.</p><p class="s8">Estrangement is manifested not only in the fact that <span class="c1">my</span> means of life belong to <span class="c1">someone else</span>, that <span class="c1">my</span> desire is the inaccessible possession of <span class="c1">another</span>, but also in the fact that everything is in itself something <span class="c1">different</span> from itself—that my activity is <span class="c1">something else</span> and that, finally (and this applies also to the capitalist), all is under the sway of <span class="c1">inhuman</span> power. There is a form of inactive, extravagant wealth given over wholly to pleasure, the enjoyer of which on the one hand <span class="c1">behaves</span> as a mere <span class="c1">ephemeral</span> individual frantically spending himself to no purpose knows the slave-labour of others (human <span class="c1">sweat and blood</span>) as the prey of his cupidity, and therefore knows man himself, and hence also his own self, as a sacrificed and empty being. With such wealth the contempt of man makes its appearance, partly as arrogance and as the throwing-away of what can give sustenance to a hundred human lives, and partly as the infamous illusion that his own unbridled extravagance and ceaseless, unproductive consumption is the condition of the other’s <span class="c1">labour</span> and therefore of his <span class="c1">subsistence</span>. He knows the realization of the <span class="c1">essential powers</span> of man only as the realization of his own excesses, his whims and capricious, bizarre notions. This wealth which, on the other hand, again knows wealth as a mere means, as something that is good for nothing but to be annihilated and which is therefore at once slave and master, at once generous and mean, capricious, presumptuous, conceited, refined, cultured and witty—this wealth has not yet experienced <span class="c1">wealth</span> as an utterly <span class="c1">alien power</span> over itself: it sees in it, rather, only its own power, and not wealth but <span class="c1">gratification</span> [is its]<a id="footnote-ref124" href="part0057.html#footnote124" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">124</sup></span></a> final aim and end.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Society</span>, as it appears to the political economist, is <span class="c1">civil society</span>, in which every individual is a totality of needs and only exists for the other person, as the other exists for him, in so far as each becomes a means for the other. The political economist reduces everything (just as does politics in its <span class="c1">Rights of Man</span>) to man, i.e., to the individual whom he strips of all determinateness so as to class him as capitalist or worker.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">division of labour</span> is the expression in political economy of the <span class="c1">social character</span> <span class="c1">of labour</span> within the estrangement.
