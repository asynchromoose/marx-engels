<p class="s33">C. The Dynamics of Capitalism</p><p class="s30">Surplus value. Surplus labour time.—Bastiat on wages. Value of labour. How determined?—Self-realization is self-preservation of capital. Capitalist may not live merely from his labour etc. Conditions for the self-realization of capital. Surplus labour time etc.—To the extent that capital is productive (as creator of surplus labour etc.), this only historic-transistory.—The free blacks in Jamaica.—Wealth which has gained autonomy requires slave labour or wage labour (forced labour in both cases).</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">What the worker exchanges with capital is his labour itself (the capacity of disposing over it); he <span class="c1">divests himself of it</span> [<span class="c1">entäussert sie</span>]. What he obtains as price is the <span class="c1">value</span> of this divestiture [<span class="c1">Entäusserung</span>]. He exchanges value-positing activity for a pre-determined value, regardless of the result of his activity. Now how is its value determined? By the objectified labour contained in his commodity. This commodity exists in his vitality. In order to maintain this from one day to the next—we are not yet dealing with the working class, i.e. the replacement for wear and tear so that it can maintain itself as a class, since the worker here confronts capital as a worker, i.e. as a presupposed perennial subject [<span class="c1">Subjekt</span>], and not yet as a mortal individual of the working species—he has to consume a certain quantity of food, to replace his used-up blood etc. He receives no more than an equivalent. Thus tomorrow, after the completed exchange—and only after he has formally completed the exchange does he execute it in the process of production—his labouring capacity exists in the same mode as before: he has received an exact equivalent, because the price which he has obtained leaves him in possession of the same exchange value he had before. Capital has paid him the amount of objectified labour contained in his vital forces. Capital has consumed it, and because it did not exist as a thing, but as the capacity of a living being, the worker can, owing to the <span class="c1">specific</span> nature of his commodity—the specific nature of the life process—resume the exchange anew. Since we are dealing here not with any <span class="c1">particularly</span> qualified labour but with labour in general, simple labour, we are here not yet concerned with the fact that there is more labour objectified in his immediate existence than is contained in his mere vitality—i.e. the labour time necessary to pay for the products necessary to maintain his vitality—namely the values he has consumed in order to produce a specific <span class="c1">labouring capacity</span>, a special <span class="c1">skill</span>—and the value of these shows itself in the costs necessary to produce a similar labouring skill.</p><p class="s8">If one day’s work were necessary in order to keep one worker alive for one day, then capital would not exist, because the working day would then exchange for its own product, so that capital could not realize itself and hence could not maintain itself as capital. The self-preservation of capital is its self-realization. If capital also had to work in order to live, then it would not maintain itself as capital but as labour. Property in raw materials and instruments of labour would be merely <span class="c1">nominal;</span> economically they would belong to the worker as much as to the capitalist, since they would create value for the capitalist only in so far as he himself were a worker. He would relate to them therefore not as capital, but as simple material and means of labour, like the worker himself does in the production process. If, however, only half a working day is necessary in order to keep one worker alive one whole day, then the surplus value of the product is self-evident, because the capitalist has paid the price of only half a working day but has obtained a whole day objectified in the product; thus has exchanged <span class="c1">nothing</span> for the second half of the work day. The only thing which can make him into a capitalist is not exchange, but rather a process through which he obtains <span class="c1">objectified labour time,</span> i.e. <span class="c1">value,</span> without exchange. Half the working day costs capital <span class="c1">nothing;</span> it thus obtains a value for which it has given no equivalent. And the multiplication of values can take place only if a value in excess of the equivalent has been obtained, hence <span class="c1">created.</span> </p><p class="s8">Surplus value in general is value in excess of the equivalent. The equivalent, by definition, is only the identity of value with itself. Hence surplus value can never sprout out of the equivalent; nor can it do so originally out of circulation; it has to arise from the production process of capital itself. The matter can also be expressed in this way: if the worker needs only half a working day in order to live a whole day, then, in order to keep alive as a worker, he needs to work only half a day. The second half of the labour day is forced labour; surplus-labour. What appears as surplus value on capital’s side appears identically on the worker’s side as surplus labour in excess of his requirements as worker, hence in excess of his immediate requirements for keeping himself alive. The great historic quality of capital is to <span class="c1">create</span> this <span class="c1">surplus labour</span>, superfluous labour from the standpoint of mere use value, mere subsistence; and its historic destiny [<span class="c1">Bestimmung</span>] is fulfilled as soon as, on one side, there has been such a development of needs that surplus labour above and beyond necessity has itself become a general need arising out of individual needs themselves—and, on the other side, when the severe discipline of capital, acting on succeeding generations [<span class="c1">Geschlechter</span>], has developed general industriousness as the general property of the new species [<span class="c1">Geschlecht</span>]—and, finally, when the development of the productive powers of labour, which capital incessantly whips onward with its unlimited mania for wealth, and of the sole conditions in which this mania can be realized, have flourished to the stage where the possession and preservation of general wealth require a lesser labour time of society as a whole, and where the labouring society relates scientifically to the process of its progressive reproduction, its reproduction in a constantly greater abundance; hence where labour in which a human being does what a thing could do has ceased. Accordingly, capital and labour relate to each other here like money and commodity; the former is the general form of wealth, the other only the substance destined for immediate consumption. Capital’s ceaseless striving towards the general form of wealth drives labour beyond the limits of its natural paltriness [<span class="c1">Naturbedürftigkeit</span>], and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality which is as all-sided in its production as in its consumption, and whose labour also therefore appears no longer as labour, but as the full development of activity itself, in which natural necessity in its direct form has disappeared; because a historically created need has taken the place of the natural one. This is <span class="c1">why capital is productive; i.e. an essential relation for the development of the social productive forces.</span> It ceases to exist as such only where the development of these productive forces themselves encounters its barrier in capital itself.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_6"><span class="c1">The Times</span> of November 1857 contains an utterly delightful cry of outrage on the part of a West-Indian plantation owner. This advocate analyses with great moral indignation—as a plea for the re-introduction of Negro slavery—how the <span class="c1">Quashees</span> (the free blacks of Jamaica) content themselves with producing only what is strictly necessary for their own consumption, and, alongside this “use value,” regard loafing (indulgence and idleness) as the real luxury good; how they do not care a damn for the sugar and the fixed capital invested in the plantations, but rather observe the planters’ impending bankruptcy with an ironic grin of malicious pleasure, and even exploit their acquired Christianity as an embellishment for this mood of malicious glee and indolence.<a id="footnote-ref224" href="part0057.html#footnote224" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">224</sup></span></a> They have ceased to be slaves, but not in order to become wage labourers, but, instead, self-sustaining peasants working for their own consumption. As far as they are concerned, capital does not exist as capital, because autonomous wealth as such can exist only either on the basis of <span class="c1">direct</span> forced labour, slavery, or <span class="c1">indirect </span>forced labour, <span class="c1">wage labour</span>. Wealth confronts direct forced labour not as capital, but rather as <span class="c1">relation of domination</span> [<span class="c1">Herrschaftsverhältnis</span>]; thus, the relation of domination is the only thing which is reproduced on this basis, for which wealth itself has value only as gratification, not as wealth itself, and which can therefore never create <span class="c1">general industriousness</span>. (We shall return to this relation of slavery and wage labour.)</p>
