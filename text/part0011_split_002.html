<p class="s31">2.	Bruno Bauer, “Die Fähigkeit der heutigen Juden und Christen frei zu werden”<a id="footnote-ref80" href="part0057.html#footnote80" class="calibre2"><span class="c"><sup class="calibre10">80</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">It is in this form that Bauer studies the relation between, the <span class="c1">Jewish and Christian religions</span>, and also their relation with modern criticism. This latter relation is their relation with “the capacity to become free.”</p><p class="s8">He reaches this conclusion: “The Christian has only to raise himself one degree, to rise above his religion, in order to abolish religion in general,” and thus to become free; but “the Jew, on the contrary, has to break not only with his Jewish nature, but also with the process towards the consummation of his religion, a process which has remained alien to him.”<a id="footnote-ref81" href="part0057.html#footnote81" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">81</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Thus Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question. The theological doubt about whether the Jew or the Christian has the better chance of attaining salvation is reproduced here in the more enlightened form: which of the two is more <span class="c1">capable of emancipation?</span> It is indeed no longer asked: which makes free—Judaism or Christianity? On the contrary, it is now asked: which makes free—the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity?</p><p class="s8">“If they wish to become free the Jews should not embrace Christianity as such, but Christianity in dissolution, religion in dissolution; that is to say, the Enlightenment, criticism, and its outcome, a free humanity.”<a id="footnote-ref82" href="part0057.html#footnote82" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">82</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">It is still a matter, therefore, of the Jews professing some kind of faith; no longer Christianity as such, but Christianity in dissolution.</p><p class="s8">Bauer asks the Jews to break with the essence of the Christian religion, but this demand does not follow, as he himself admits, from the development of the Jewish nature.</p><p class="s8">From the moment when Bauer, at the end of his <span class="c1">Judenfrage</span>, saw in Judaism only a crude religious criticism of Christianity, and, therefore, attributed to it only a religious significance, it was to be expected that he would transform the emancipation of the Jews into a philosophico-theological act.</p><p class="s8">Bauer regards the <span class="c1">ideal</span> and abstract essence of the Jew—his <span class="c1">religion</span>—as the <span class="c1">whole</span> of his nature. He, therefore, concludes rightly that “The Jew contributes nothing to mankind when he disregards his own limited law,” when he renounces all his Judaism.<a id="footnote-ref83" href="part0057.html#footnote83" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">83</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">The relation between Jews and Christians thus becomes the following: the only interest which the emancipation of the Jew presents for the Christian is a general human and <span class="c1">theoretical</span> interest. Judaism is a phenomenon which offends the religious eye of the Christian. As soon as the Christian’s eye ceases to be religious the phenomenon ceases to offend it. The emancipation of the Jew is not in itself, therefore, a task which falls to the Christian to perform.</p><p class="s8">The Jew, on the other hand, if he wants to emancipate himself has to undertake, besides his own work, the work of the Christian—the “criticism of the gospels,” of the “life of Jesus,” etc.<a id="footnote-ref84" href="part0057.html#footnote84" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">84</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">“It is for them to arrange matters; they will decide their own destiny. But history does not allow itself to be mocked.”<a id="footnote-ref85" href="part0057.html#footnote85" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">85</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">We will attempt to escape from the theological formulation of the question. For us, the question concerning the capacity of the Jew for emancipation is transformed into another question: what specific <span class="c1">social </span>element is it necessary to overcome in order to abolish Judaism? For the capacity of the present-day Jew to emancipate himself expresses the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the contemporary world. The relation results necessarily from the particular situation of Judaism in the present enslaved world.</p><p class="s8">Let us consider the real Jew: not the <span class="c1">sabbath Jew</span>, whom Bauer considers, but the <span class="c1">everyday Jew</span>.</p><p class="s8">Let us not seek the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us seek the secret of the religion in the real Jew.</p><p class="s8">What is the profane basis of Judaism? <span class="c1">Practical</span> need, <span class="c1">self-interest</span>. What is the worldly cult of the Jew? <span class="c1">Huckstering</span>. What is his worldly god? <span class="c1">Money</span>.</p><p class="s8">Very well: then in emancipating itself from <span class="c1">huckstering</span> and <span class="c1">money</span>, and thus from real and practical Judaism, our age would emancipate itself.</p><p class="s8">An organization of society which would abolish the pre-conditions and thus the very possibility of huckstering, would make the Jew impossible. His religious consciousness would evaporate like some insipid vapour in the real, life-giving air of society. On the other hand, when the Jew recognizes his <span class="c1">practical </span>nature as invalid and endeavours to abolish it, he begins to deviate from his former path of development, works for general <span class="c1">human emancipation</span> and turns against the <span class="c1">supreme practical</span> expression of human self-estrangement.</p><p class="s8">We discern in Judaism, therefore, a universal <span class="c1">antisocial</span> element of the <span class="c1">present time</span>, whose historical development, zealously aided in its harmful aspects by the Jews, has now attained its culminating point, a point at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate.</p><p class="s8">In the final analysis, the <span class="c1">emancipation of</span> the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from <span class="c1">Judaism</span>.</p><p class="s8">The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish fashion. “The Jew, who is merely tolerated in Vienna for example, determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power. The Jew, who may be entirely without rights in the smallest German state, decides the destiny or Europe. While the corporations and guilds exclude the Jew, or at least look on him with disfavour, the audacity of industry mocks the obstinacy of medieval institutions.”<a id="footnote-ref86" href="part0057.html#footnote86" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">86</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">This is not an isolated instance. The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner, not only by acquiring the power of money, but also because <span class="c1">money</span> has become, through him and also apart from him, a world power, while the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves in so far as the Christians have become Jews.</p><p class="s8">Thus, for example, Captain Hamilton reports that the devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoon who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him. <span class="c1">Mammon</span> is his idol which he adores not only with his lips but with the whole force of his body and mind. In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange, and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbour. Trade has seized upon all his thoughts, and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects. When he travels he carries, so to speak, his goods and his counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit. If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors.<a id="footnote-ref87" href="part0057.html#footnote87" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">87</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">In North America, indeed, the effective domination of the Christian world by Judaism has come to be manifested in a common and unambiguous form; the <span class="c1">preaching of the Gospel</span> itself, Christian preaching, has become an article of commerce, and the bankrupt trader in the church behaves like the prosperous clergyman in business. “This man whom you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader; his business having failed he has become a minister. This other began as a priest, but as soon as he had accumulated some money he abandoned the priesthood for trade. In the eyes of many people the religious ministry is a veritable industrial career.”<a id="footnote-ref88" href="part0057.html#footnote88" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">88</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">According to Bauer, it is “a hypocritical situation when, in theory, the Jew is deprived of political rights, while in practice he wields tremendous power and exercises on a wholesale scale the political influence which is denied him in minor matters.”<a id="footnote-ref89" href="part0057.html#footnote89" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">89</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">The contradiction which exists between the effective political power of the Jew and his political rights, is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general. Politics is in principle superior to the power of money, but in practice it has become its bondsman.</p><p class="s8">Judaism has maintained itself <span class="c1">alongside</span> Christianity, not only because it constituted the religious criticism of Christianity and embodied the doubt concerning the religious origins of Christianity, but equally because the practical Jewish spirit—Judaism or commerce<a id="footnote-ref90" href="part0057.html#footnote90" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">90</sup></span></a>—has perpetuated itself in Christian society and has even attained its highest development there. The Jew, who occupies a distinctive place in civil society, only manifests in a distinctive way the Judaism of civil society.</p><p class="s8">Judaism has been preserved, not in spite of history, but by history. </p><p class="s8">It is from its own entrails that civil society ceaselessly engenders the Jew. </p><p class="s8">What was, in itself, the basis of the Jewish religion? Practical need, egoism.</p><p class="s8">The monotheism of the Jews is, therefore, in reality, a polytheism of the numerous needs of man, a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine regulation. <span class="c1">Practical need, egoism,</span> is the principle of <span class="c1">civil society</span>, and is revealed as such in its pure form as soon as civil society has fully engendered the political state. The god of <span class="c1">practical need and self-interest</span> is money.</p><p class="s8">Money is the jealous god of Israel, beside which no other god may exist. Money abases all the gods of mankind and changes them into commodities. Money is the universal and self-sufficient <span class="c1">value</span> of all things. It has, therefore, deprived the whole world, both the human world and nature, of their own proper value. Money is the alienated essence of man’s work and existence; this essence dominates him and he worships it.</p><p class="s8">The god of the Jews has been secularized and has become the god of this world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange.</p><p class="s8">The mode of perceiving nature, under the rule of private property and money, is a real contempt for, and a practical degradation of, nature, which does indeed exist in the Jewish religion but only as a creature of the imagination.</p><p class="s8">It is in this sense that Thomas Münzer declares it intolerable “that every creature should be transformed into property—the fishes in the water, the birds of the air, the plants of the earth: the creature too should become free.”<a id="footnote-ref91" href="part0057.html#footnote91" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">91</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">That which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish religion—contempt for theory, for art, for history, and for man as an end in himself—is the <span class="c1">real, conscious</span> standpoint and the virtue of the man of money. Even the species-relation itself, the relation between man and woman, becomes an object of commerce. Woman is bartered away.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">chimerical </span>nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the trader, and above all of the financier.</p><p class="s8">The law, without basis or reason, of the Jew, is only the religious caricature of morality and right in general, without basis or reason; the purely <span class="c1">formal</span> rites with which the world of self-interest encircles itself.</p><p class="s8">Here again the supreme condition of man is his <span class="c1">legal</span> status, his relationship to laws which are valid for him, not because they are the laws of his own will and nature, but because they are dominant and any infraction of them will be <span class="c1">avenged</span>.</p><p class="s8">Jewish Jesuitism, the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer discovers in the Talmud, is the relationship of the world of self-interest to the laws which govern this world, laws which the world devotes its principal arts to circumventing.</p><p class="s8">Indeed, the operation of this world within its framework of laws is impossible without the continual supersession of law.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Judaism </span>could not develop further as a <span class="c1">religion</span>, in a theoretical form, because the world view of practical need is, by its very nature, circumscribed, and the delineation of its characteristics soon completed.</p><p class="s8">The religion of practical need could not, by its very nature, find its consummation in theory, but only in <span class="c1">practice</span>, just because practice is its truth.</p><p class="s8">Judaism could not create a new world. It could only bring the new creations and conditions of the world within its own sphere of activity, because practical need, the spirit of which is self-interest, is always passive, cannot expand at will, but <span class="c1">finds</span> itself extended as a result of the continued development of society.</p><p class="s8">Judaism attains its apogee with the perfection of civil society; but civil society only reaches perfection in the <span class="c1">Christian</span> world. Only under the sway of Christianity, which <span class="c1">objectifies all</span> national, natural, moral and theoretical relationships, could civil society separate itself completely from the life of the state, sever all the species-bonds of man, establish egoism and selfish need in their place, and dissolve the human world into a world of atomistic, antagonistic individuals.</p><p class="s8">Christianity issued from Judaism. It has now been re-absorbed into Judaism.</p><p class="s8">From the beginning, the Christian was the theorizing Jew; consequently, the Jew is the practical Christian. And the practical Christian has become a Jew again. </p><p class="s8">It was only in appearance that Christianity overcame real Judaism. It was too <span class="c1">refined</span>, too spiritual to eliminate the crudeness of practical need except by raising it into the ethereal realm.</p><p class="s8">Christianity is the sublime thought of Judaism; Judaism is the vulgar practical application of Christianity. But this practical application could only become universal when Christianity as perfected religion had accomplished, in a <span class="c1">theoretical</span> fashion, the alienation of man from himself and from nature.</p><p class="s8">It was only then that Judaism could attain universal domination and could turn alienated man and alienated nature into <span class="c1">alienable</span>, saleable objects, in thrall to egoistic need and huckstering.</p><p class="s8">Objectification is the practice of alienation. Just as man, so long as he is engrossed in religion, can only objectify his essence by an <span class="c1">alien</span> and fantastic being; so under the sway of egoistic need, he can only affirm himself and produce objects in practice by subordinating his products and his own activity to the domination of an alien entity, and by attributing to them the significance of an alien entity, namely money. </p><p class="s8">In its perfected practice the spiritual egoism of Christianity necessarily becomes the material egoism of the Jew, celestial need is transmuted into terrestrial need, subjectivism into self-interest. The tenacity of the Jew is to be explained, not by his religion, but rather by the human basis of his religion—practical need and egoism.</p><p class="s8">It is because the essence of the Jew was universally realized and secularized in civil society, that civil society could not convince the Jew of the <span class="c1">unreality</span> of his <span class="c1">religious</span> essence, which is precisely the ideal representation of practical need. It is not only, therefore, in the Pentateuch and the Talmud, but also in contemporary society, that we find the essence of the present-day Jew; not as an abstract essence, but as one which is supremely empirical, not only as a limitation of the Jew, but as the Jewish narrowness of society.</p><p class="s8">As soon as society succeeds in abolishing the <span class="c1">empirical</span> essence of Judaism—huckstering and its conditions—the Jew becomes <span class="c1">impossible</span>, because his consciousness no longer has an object. The subjective basis of Judaism—practical need—assumes a human form, and the conflict between the individual, sensuous existence of man and his species-existence, is abolished.</p><p class="s32" id="calibre_pb_4"><span class="c7">The </span>social<span class="c7"> emancipation of the Jew is the </span>emancipation of society from Judaism.</p>
