<p class="s8">For Germany, the <span class="c1">criticism of religion</span> has been largely completed; and the criticism of religion is the premise of all criticism.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">profane </span>existence of error is compromised once its <span class="c1">celestial oratio pro aris et focis</span> has been refuted. Man, who has found in the fantastic reality of heaven, where he sought a supernatural being, only his own reflection, will no longer be tempted to find only the <span class="c1">semblance</span> of himself—a non-human being—where he seeks and must seek his true reality.</p><p class="s8">The basis of irreligious criticism is this: <span class="c1">man makes religion;</span> religion does not make man. Religion is indeed man’s self-consciousness and self-awareness so long as he has not found himself or has lost himself again. But <span class="c1">man</span> is not an abstract being, squatting outside the world. Man is the <span class="c1">human world</span>, the state, society. This state, this society, produce religion which is an <span class="c1">inverted world consciousness,</span> because they are an <span class="c1">inverted world</span>. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual <span class="c1">point d’honneur</span>, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its general basis of consolation and justification. It is the <span class="c1">fantastic realization</span> of the human being inasmuch as the <span class="c1">human being</span> possesses no true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly a struggle against <span class="c1">that world</span> whose spiritual <span class="c1">aroma</span> is religion.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Religious</span> suffering is at the same time an <span class="c1">expression</span> of real suffering and a <span class="c1">protest</span> against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the sentiment of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the <span class="c1">opium</span> of the people.</p><p class="s8">The abolition of religion as the <span class="c1">illusory</span> happiness of men, is a demand for their <span class="c1">real</span> happiness. The call to abandon their illusions about their condition is a <span class="c1">call to abandon a condition which requires illusions</span>. The criticism of religion is, therefore, <span class="c1">the embryonic criticism of this vale of tears</span> of which religion is the <span class="c1">halo</span>.</p><p class="s8"> Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain, not in order that man shall bear the chain without caprice or consolation but so that he shall cast off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man so that he will think, act and fashion his reality as a man who has lost his illusions and regained his reason; so that he will revolve about himself as his own true sun. Religion is only the illusory sun about which man revolves so long as he does not revolve about himself.</p><p class="s8">It is the <span class="c1">task of history</span>, therefore, once the <span class="c1">other-world of truth</span> has vanished, to establish the <span class="c1">truth of this world</span>. The immediate <span class="c1">task of philosophy</span>, which is in the service of history, is to unmask human self-alienation in its <span class="c1">secular</span> form now that it has been unmasked in its <span class="c1">sacred form</span>. Thus the criticism of heaven is transformed into the criticism of earth, the <span class="c1">criticism of religion</span> into the <span class="c1">criticism of law</span>, and the <span class="c1">criticism of theology</span> into the <span class="c1">criticism of politics</span>.</p><p class="s8">The following exposition<a id="footnote-ref92" href="part0057.html#footnote92" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">92</sup></span></a>—which is a contribution to this undertaking—does not deal directly with the original but with a copy, the German <span class="c1">philosophy </span>of the state and of right, for the simple reason that it deals with Germany.</p><p class="s8">If one were to begin with the <span class="c1">status quo</span> itself in Germany, even in the most appropriate way, i.e. negatively, the result would still be an <span class="c1">anachronism</span>. Even the negation of our political present is already a dusty fact in the historical lumber room of modern nations. I may negate powdered wigs, but I am still left with unpowdered wigs. If I negate the German situation of 1843 I have, according to French chronology, hardly reached the year 1789, and still less the vital centre of the present day.</p><p class="s8">German history, indeed, prides itself upon a development which no other nation had previously accomplished, or will ever imitate in the historical sphere. We have shared in the restorations of modern nations without ever sharing in their revolutions. We have been restored, first because other nations have dared to make revolutions, and secondly because other nations have suffered counterrevolutions; in the first case because our masters were afraid, and in the second case because they were not afraid. Led by our shepherds, we have only once kept company with liberty and that was on the <span class="c1">day of its internment</span>.</p><p class="s8">A school of thought, which justifies the infamy of today by that of yesterday, which regards every cry from the serf under the knout as a cry of rebellion once the knout has become time-honoured, ancestral and historical, a school for which history shows only its <span class="c1">a posteriori</span> as the God of Israel did for his servant Moses—the <span class="c1">Historical school of law</span><a id="footnote-ref93" href="part0057.html#footnote93" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">93</sup></span></a>—might be supposed to have invented German history, if it were not in fact itself an invention of German history, A Shylock, but a servile Shylock, it swears upon its bond, its historical, Christian-Germanic bond, for every pound of flesh cut from the heart of the people.</p><p class="s8">On the other hand, good-natured enthusiasts, German chauvinists by temperament and enlightened liberals by reflection, seek our history of liberty beyond our history, in the primeval Teutonic forests. But how does the history of our liberty differ from the history of the wild boar’s liberty, if it is only to be found in the forests? And as the proverb has it: what is shouted into the forest, the forest echoes back. So peace upon the primeval Teutonic forests!</p><p class="s8">But <span class="c1">war</span> upon the state of affairs in Germany! By all means! This state of affairs is <span class="c1">beneath the level of history, beneath all criticism;</span> nevertheless it remains an object of criticism just as the criminal who is beneath humanity remains an object of the <span class="c1">executioner.</span> In its struggle against this state of affairs criticism is not a passion of the head, but the head of passion. It is not a lancet but a weapon. Its object is an <span class="c1">enemy</span> which it aims not to refute but to <span class="c1">destroy</span>. For the spirit of this state of affairs has already been refuted. It is not, in itself, an object worthy of our thought; it is an <span class="c1">existence</span> as contemptible as it is despised. Criticism itself has no need of any further elucidation of this object, for it has already understood it. Criticism is no longer an end in itself, but simply a means; <span class="c1">indignation</span> is its essential mode of feeling, and <span class="c1">denunciation</span> its principal task.</p><p class="s8">It is a matter of depicting the stifling pressure which the different social spheres exert upon other, the universal but passive ill-humour, the complacent but self-deluding narrowness of spirit; all this incorporated in a system of government which lives by conserving this paltriness, and is itself <span class="c1">paltriness in government</span>.</p><p class="s8">What a spectacle! Society is infinitely divided into the most diverse races, which confront each other with their petty antipathies, bad conscience and coarse mediocrity; and which, precisely because of their ambiguous and mistrustful situation, are treated without exception, though in different ways, as merely tolerated existences by their masters. And they are forced to recognize and acknowledge this fact of being <span class="c1">dominated, governed</span> and <span class="c1">possessed</span>, as a <span class="c1">concession from heaven!</span> On the other side are the rulers themselves, whose greatness is in inverse proportion to their number.</p><p class="s8">The criticism which deals with this subject-matter is criticism in a hand-to-hand fight; and in such a fight it is of no interest to know whether the adversary is of the same rank, is noble or <span class="c1">interesting</span>—all that matters is to <span class="c1">strike</span> him. It is a question of denying the Germans an instant of illusion or resignation. The burden must be made still more irksome by awakening a consciousness of it, and shame must be made more shameful still by rendering it public. Every sphere of German society must be depicted as the <span class="c1">partie honteuse</span> of German society; and these petrified social conditions must be made to dance by singing their own melody to them. The nation must be taught to be <span class="c1">terrified</span> of itself, in order to give it <span class="c1">courage</span>. In this way an imperious need of the German nation will be satisfied, and the needs of nations are themselves the final causes of their satisfaction.</p><p class="s8">Even for the modern nations this struggle against the limited character of the German <span class="c1">status quo</span> does not lack interest; for the German <span class="c1">status quo</span> is the open <span class="c1">consummation of the ancien régime</span>, and the <span class="c1">ancien régime</span> is the <span class="c1">hidden defect of the modern state</span>. The struggle against the political present of the Germans is a struggle against the past of the modern nations, who are still continually importuned by the reminiscences of this past. It is instructive for the modern nations to see the <span class="c1">ancien régime</span>, which has played a <span class="c1">tragic</span> part in their history, play a <span class="c1">comic</span> part as a German ghost. The <span class="c1">ancien régime</span> had a <span class="c1">tragic</span> history, so long as it was the established power in the world while liberty was a personal fancy; in short, so long as it believed and had to believe in its own validity. So long as the <span class="c1">ancien régime</span>, as an existing world order, struggled against a new world which was just coming into existence, there was on its side a historical error but no personal error. Its decline was, therefore, tragic.</p><p class="s8">The present German régime, on the other hand, which is an anachronism, a flagrant contradiction of universally accepted axioms—the nullity of the <span class="c1">ancien régime</span> revealed to the whole world—only imagines that it believes in itself and asks the world to share its illusion. If it believed in its own <span class="c1">nature</span> would it attempt to hide it beneath the <span class="c1">semblance</span> of an alien nature and look for its salvation in hypocrisy and sophistry? The modern <span class="c1">ancien régime</span> is the comedian of a world order whose <span class="c1">real heroes</span> are dead. History is thorough, and it goes through many stages when it conducts an ancient formation to its grave. The last stage of a world-historical formation is comedy. The Greek gods, already once mortally wounded in Aeschylus’ tragedy <span class="c1">Prometheus Bound</span>, had to endure a second death, a comic death, in Lucian’s dialogues. Why should history proceed in this way? So that mankind shall separate itself <span class="c1">gladly</span> from its past. We claim this <span class="c1">joyful</span> historical destiny for the political powers of Germany.</p><p class="s8">But as soon as criticism concerns itself with modern social and political reality, and thus arrives at genuine human problems, it must either go outside the German <span class="c1">status quo</span> or approach its object indirectly. For example, the relation of industry, of the world of wealth in general, to the political world is a major problem of modern times. In what form does this problem begin to preoccupy the Germans? In the form of <span class="c1">protective tariffs</span>, the <span class="c1">system of prohibition</span>, the <span class="c1">national economy.</span> German chauvinism has passed from men to matter, so that one fine day our knights of cotton and heroes of iron found themselves metamorphosed into patriots. The sovereignty of monopoly within the country has begun to be recognized since <span class="c1">sovereignty vis-à-vis foreign countries</span> was attributed to it. In Germany, therefore, a beginning is made with what came as the conclusion in France and England. The old, rotten order against which these nations revolt in their theories, and which they bear only as chains are borne, is hailed in Germany as the dawn of a glorious future which as yet hardly dares to move from a cunning<a id="footnote-ref94" href="part0057.html#footnote94" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">94</sup></span></a> theory to a ruthless practice. While in France and England the problem is put in the form: <span class="c1">political economy</span> or the <span class="c1">rule of society over wealth;</span> in Germany it is put in the form: <span class="c1">national economy</span> or the <span class="c1">rule of private property over nationality</span>. Thus, in England and France it is a question of abolishing monopoly, which has developed to its final consequences; while in Germany it is a question of proceeding to the final consequences of monopoly. There it is a question of the solution; here, only a question of the collision. We can see very well from this example how modern problems are presented in Germany; the example shows that our history, like a raw recruit, has so far only had to do extra drill on old and hackneyed historical matters.</p><p class="s8">If the <span class="c1">whole</span> of German development were at the level of German <span class="c1">political</span> development, a German could have no greater part in contemporary problems than can a <span class="c1">Russian</span>. If the individual is not restricted by the limitations of his country, still less is the nation liberated by the liberation of one individual. The fact that a Scythian was one of the Greek philosophers<a id="footnote-ref95" href="part0057.html#footnote95" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">95</sup></span></a> did not enable the Scythians to advance a single step towards Greek culture.</p><p class="s8">Fortunately, we Germans are not Scythians.</p><p class="s8">Just as the nations of the ancient world lived their pre-history in the imagination, in mythology, so we Germans have lived our post-history in thought, in <span class="c1">philosophy</span>. We are the <span class="c1">philosophical</span> contemporaries of the present day without being its <span class="c1">historical</span> contemporaries. German philosophy is the <span class="c1">ideal prolongation</span> of German history. When, therefore, we criticize, instead of the <span class="c1">oeuvres incomplètes</span> of our real history, the <span class="c1">oeuvres posthumes</span> of our ideal history—<span class="c1">philosophy</span>, our criticism stands at the centre of the problems of which the present age says: <span class="c1">that is the question</span>. That which constitutes, for the advanced nations, a <span class="c1">practical </span>break with modern political conditions, is in Germany where these conditions do not yet exist, virtually a <span class="c1">critical</span> break with their philosophical reflection.</p><p class="s8">The German <span class="c1">philosophy of right and of the state</span> is the only German history which is <span class="c1">al pari</span> with the <span class="c1">official </span>modern times. The German nation is obliged, therefore, to connect its dream history with its present conditions, and to subject to criticism not only these existing conditions but also their abstract continuation. Its future cannot be restricted either to the direct negation of its real juridical and political circumstances, or to the direct realization of its ideal juridical and political circumstances. The direct negation of its real circumstances already exists in its ideal circumstances, while it has almost outlived the realization of its ideal circumstances in the contemplation of neighbouring nations. It is with good reason, therefore, that the <span class="c1">practical</span> political party in Germany demands the <span class="c1">negation of philosophy</span>. Its error does not consist in formulating this demand, but in limiting itself to a demand which it does not, and cannot, make effective. It supposes that it can achieve this negation by turning its back on philosophy, looking elsewhere, and murmuring a few trite and ill-humoured phrases. Because of its narrow outlook it does not take account of philosophy as part of <span class="c1">German</span> reality, and even regards philosophy as beneath the level of German practical life and its theories. You demand as a point of departure real germs of life, but you forget that the real germ of life of the German nation has so far sprouted only in its <span class="c1">cranium</span>. In short, <span class="c1">you cannot abolish philosophy without realizing it.</span></p><p class="s8">The same error was committed, but in the opposite direction, by the <span class="c1">theoretical</span> party which originated in philosophy.</p><p class="s8">In the present struggle, this party saw only the <span class="c1">critical struggle of philosophy against the German world</span>. It did not consider that <span class="c1">previous philosophy</span> itself belongs to this world and is its complement, even if only an ideal complement. Critical as regards its counterpart, it was not self-critical. It took as its point of departure the <span class="c1">presuppositions</span> of philosophy; and either accepted the conclusions which philosophy had reached or else presented as direct philosophical demands and conclusions, demands and conclusions drawn from elsewhere. But these latter—assuming their legitimacy—can only be achieved by the <span class="c1">negation of previous philosophy</span>, that is, philosophy as philosophy. We shall provide later a more comprehensive account of this party. Its principal defect may be summarized as follows: <span class="c1">it believed that it could realize philosophy without abolishing it.</span></p><p class="s8">The criticism of the <span class="c1">German philosophy of right and of the state</span> which was given its most logical, profound and complete expression by Hegel, is at once the critical analysis of the modern state and of the reality connected with it, and the definitive negation of all the past <span class="c1">forms of consciousness in German jurisprudence and politics</span>, whose most distinguished and most general expression, raised to the level of a <span class="c1">science</span>, is precisely the <span class="c1">speculative philosophy of right</span>. If it was only Germany which could produce the speculative philosophy of right—this extravagant and abstract thought about the modern state, the reality of which remains in the beyond (even if this beyond is only across the Rhine)—the <span class="c1">German</span> representative of the modern state, on the contrary, which leaves out of account the <span class="c1">real man</span> was itself only possible because, and to the extent that, the modern state itself leaves the <span class="c1">real man</span> out of account or only satisfies the <span class="c1">whole</span> man in an illusory way. In politics, the Germans have <span class="c1">thought</span> what other nations have <span class="c1">done</span>. Germany has been their <span class="c1">theoretical consciousness</span>. The abstraction and presumption of its philosophy was in step with the partial and stunted character of their reality. If, therefore, the <span class="c1">status quo</span> of the <span class="c1">German political system</span> expresses the <span class="c1">consummation of the ancien régime</span>, the thorn in the flesh of the modern state, the <span class="c1">status quo</span> of <span class="c1">German political science</span> expresses the <span class="c1">imperfection of the modern state</span> itself, the degeneracy of its flesh.</p><p class="s8">As the determined adversary of the previous form of German political consciousness, the criticism of the speculative philosophy of right does not remain within its own sphere, but leads on to <span class="c1">tasks</span> which can only be solved by <span class="c1">means of practical activity.</span></p><p class="s8">The question then arises: can Germany attain a practical activity <span class="c1">à la hauteur des principes;</span> that is to say, a revolution which will raise it not only to the <span class="c1">official level</span> of the modern nations, but to the <span class="c1">human level</span> which will be the immediate future of those nations.</p><p class="s8">It is clear that the arm of criticism cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be overthrown by material force; but theory itself becomes a material force when it has seized the masses. Theory is capable of seizing the masses when it demonstrates <span class="c1">ad hominem</span>, and it demonstrates <span class="c1">ad hominem</span> as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself. What proves beyond doubt the radicalism of German theory, and thus its practical energy, is that it begins from the resolute <span class="c1">positive</span> abolition of religion. The criticism of religion ends with the doctrine that <span class="c1">man is the supreme being for man</span>. It ends, therefore, with the <span class="c1">categorical imperative to overthrow all those conditions</span> in which man is an abased, enslaved, abandoned, contemptible being—conditions which can hardly be better described than in the exclamation of a Frenchman on the occasion of a proposed tax upon dogs: “Wretched dogs! They want to treat you like men!”</p><p class="s8">Even from the historical standpoint theoretical emancipation has a specific practical importance for Germany. In fact Germany’s <span class="c1">revolutionary</span> past is theoretical—it is the <span class="c1">Reformation</span>. In that period the revolution originated in the brain of a monk, today in the brain of the philosopher.</p><p class="s8">Luther, without question, overcame servitude through devotion but only by substituting servitude through <span class="c1">conviction</span>. He shattered the faith in authority by restoring the authority of faith. He transformed the priests into laymen by turning laymen into priests. He liberated man from external religiosity by making religiosity the innermost essence of man. He liberated the body from its chains because he fettered the heart with chains.</p><p class="s8">But if Protestantism was not the solution it did at least pose the problem correctly. It was no longer a question, thereafter, of the layman’s struggle against the priest outside himself, but of his struggle against his <span class="c1">own internal priest</span>, against his own <span class="c1">priestly nature</span>. And if the Protestant metamorphosis of German laymen into priests emancipated the lay popes—the <span class="c1">princes</span> together with their clergy, the privileged and the philistines—the philosophical metamorphosis of the priestly Germans into men will emancipate the <span class="c1">people</span>. But just as emancipation will not be confined to princes, so the <span class="c1">secularization</span> of property will not be limited to the <span class="c1">confiscation of church property</span>, which was practiced especially by hypocritical Prussia. At that time, the Peasant War, the most radical event in German history, came to grief because of theology.</p><p class="s8">Today, when theology itself has come to grief, the most unfree phenomenon in German history—our <span class="c1">status quo</span>—will be shattered by philosophy. On the eve of the Reformation official Germany was the most abject servant of Rome. On the eve of its revolution Germany is the abject servant of those who are far inferior to Rome; of Prussia and Austria, of petty squires and philistines.</p><p class="s8">But a <span class="c1">radical</span> revolution in Germany seems to encounter a major difficulty.</p><p class="s8">Revolutions need a <span class="c1">passive</span> element, a <span class="c1">material </span>basis. Theory is only realized in a people so far as it fulfils the needs of the people. Will there correspond to the monstrous discrepancy between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality a similar discrepancy between civil society and the state, and within civil society itself? Will theoretical needs be directly practical needs? It is not enough that thought should seek to realize itself; reality must also strive towards thought.</p><p class="s8">But Germany has not passed through the intermediate stage of political emancipation at the same time as the modern nations. It has not yet attained in practice those stages which it has transcended in theory. How could Germany, in <span class="c1">salta mortale</span>, surmount not only its own barriers but also those of the modern nations, that is, those barriers which it must in reality experience and strive for as an emancipation from its own real barriers? A radical revolution can only be a revolution of radical needs, for which the conditions and breeding ground appear to be lacking.</p><p class="s8">But if Germany accompanied the development of the modern nations only through the abstract activity of thought, without taking an active part in the real struggles of this development, it has also experienced the <span class="c1">pains</span> of this development without sharing in its pleasures and partial satisfactions. The abstract activity on one side has its counterpart in the abstract suffering on the other. And one fine day Germany will find itself at the level of the European decadence, before ever having attained the level of European emancipation. It will be comparable to a fetishist who is sickening from the diseases of Christianity.</p><p class="s8">If the <span class="c1">German governments</span> are examined it will be found that the circumstances of the time, the situation of Germany, the outlook of German culture, and lastly their own fortunate instinct, all drive them to combine the <span class="c1">civilized deficiencies</span> of the <span class="c1">modern political world</span> (whose advantages we do not enjoy) with the <span class="c1">barbarous deficiencies</span> of the <span class="c1">ancien régime</span> (which we enjoy in full measure); so that Germany must participate more and more, if not in the reason at least in the unreason of those political systems which transcend its <span class="c1">status quo</span>. Is there, for example, any country in the whole world which shares with such naïvet<span class="c1">é</span> as so-called constitutional Germany all the illusions of the constitutional r<span class="c1">é</span>gime without sharing its realities? And was it not, of necessity, a German government which had the idea of combining the torments of censorship with the torments of the French September laws<a id="footnote-ref96" href="part0057.html#footnote96" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">96</sup></span></a> which presuppose the liberty of the Press? Just as the gods of all the nations were to be found in the Roman Pantheon, so there will be found in the Holy Roman German Empire all the sins of all the forms of State. That this eclecticism will attain an unprecedented degree is assured in particular by the <span class="c1">politico-aesthetic gourmandise</span> of a German king who proposes to play all the roles of royalty—feudal or bureaucratic, absolute or constitutional, autocratic or democratic—if not in the person of the people at least in his <span class="c1">own</span> person, and if not for the people, at least for <span class="c1">himself</span>. <span class="c1">Germany, as the deficiency of present-day politics constituted into a system,</span> will not be able to demolish the specific German barriers without demolishing the general barriers of present-day politics.</p><p class="s8">It is not <span class="c1">radical</span> revolution, <span class="c1">universal human</span> emancipation, which is a Utopian dream for Germany, but rather a partial, <span class="c1">merely</span> political revolution which leaves the pillars of the building standing. What is the basis of a partial, merely political revolution? Simply this: a <span class="c1">section of civil society</span> emancipates itself and attains universal domination; a determinate class undertakes, from its <span class="c1">particular situation,</span> a general emancipation of society. This class emancipates society as a whole, but only on condition that the whole of society is in the same situation as this class; for example, that it possesses or can easily acquire money or culture. </p><p class="s8">No class in civil society can play this part unless it can arouse, in itself and in the masses, a moment of enthusiasm in which it associates and mingles with society at large, identifies itself with it, and is felt and recognized as the <span class="c1">general representative</span> of this society. Its aims and interests must genuinely be the aims and interests of society itself, of which it becomes in reality the social head and heart. It is only in the name of general interests that a particular class can claim general supremacy. In order to attain this liberating position, and the political direction of all spheres of society, revolutionary energy and consciousness of its own power do not suffice. For a <span class="c1">popular revolution</span> and the <span class="c1">emancipation of a particular class</span> of civil society to coincide, for <span class="c1">one</span> class to represent the whole of society, another class must concentrate in itself all the evils of society, a particular class must embody and represent a general obstacle and limitation. A particular social sphere must be regarded as the <span class="c1">notorious crime</span> of the whole society, so that emancipation from this sphere appears as a general emancipation. For <span class="c1">one</span> class to be the liberating class <span class="c1">par excellence</span>, it is necessary that another class should be openly the oppressing class. The negative significance of the French nobility and clergy produced the positive significance of the bourgeoisie, the class which stood next to them and opposed them.</p><p class="s8">But in Germany every class lacks the logic, insight, courage and clarity which would make it a negative representative of society. Moreover, there is also lacking in every class the generosity of spirit which identifies itself, if only for a moment, with the popular mind; that genius which pushes material force to political power, that revolutionary daring which throws at its adversary the defiant phrase: <span class="c1">I am nothing and I should be everything</span>. The essence of German morality and honour, in classes as in individuals, is a <span class="c1">modest egoism</span> which displays, and allows others to display, its own narrowness. The relation between the different spheres of German society is, therefore, not dramatic, but epic. Each of these spheres begins to be aware of itself and to establish itself beside the others, not from the moment when it is oppressed, but from the moment that circumstances, without any action of its own, have created a new sphere which it can in turn oppress. Even the <span class="c1">moral sentiment of the German middle class</span> has no other basis than the consciousness of being the representative of the narrow and limited mediocrity of all the other classes. It is not only the German kings, therefore, who ascend their thrones <span class="c1">mal à propos</span>. Each sphere of civil society suffers a defeat before gaining the victory; it erects its own barrier before having destroyed the barrier which opposes it; it displays the narrowness of its views before having displayed their generosity, and thus every opportunity of playing an important role has passed before it properly existed, and each class, at the very moment when it begins its struggle against the class above it, remains involved in a struggle against the class beneath. For this reason, the princes are in conflict with the monarch, the bureaucracy with the nobility, the bourgeoisie with all of them, while the proletariat is already beginning its struggle with the bourgeoisie. The middle class hardly dares to conceive the idea of emancipation from its own point of view before the development of social conditions, and the progress of political theory, show that this point of view is already antiquated, or at least disputable.</p><p class="s8">In France it is enough to be something in order to desire to be everything. In Germany no one has the right to be anything without first renouncing everything. In France partial emancipation is a basis for complete emancipation. In Germany complete emancipation is a <span class="c1">conditio sine qua non</span> for any partial emancipation. In France it is the reality, in Germany the impossibility, of a progressive emancipation which must give birth to complete liberty. In France every class of the population is <span class="c1">politically idealistic</span> and considers itself first of all, not as a particular class, but as the representative of the general needs of society. The role of liberator can, therefore, pass successively in a dramatic movement to different classes in the population, until it finally reaches the class which achieves social freedom; no longer assuming certain conditions external to man, which are none the less created by human society, but organizing all the conditions of human life on the basis of social freedom. In Germany, on the contrary, where practical life is as little intellectual as intellectual life is practical, no class of civil society feels the need for, or the ability to achieve, a general emancipation, until it is forced to it by its <span class="c1">immediate</span> situation, by <span class="c1">material</span> necessity and by <span class="c1">its fetters themselves</span>.</p><p class="s8">Where is there, then, a <span class="c1">real </span>possibility of emancipation in Germany?</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">This is our reply</span>. A class must be formed which has <span class="c1">radical chains</span>, a class in civil society which is not a class of civil society, a class which is the dissolution of all classes, a sphere of society which has a universal character because its sufferings are universal, and which does not claim a <span class="c1">particular redress</span> because the wrong which is done to it is not a <span class="c1">particular wrong</span> but <span class="c1">wrong in general</span>. There must be formed a sphere of society which claims no <span class="c1">traditional</span> status but only a human status, a sphere which is not opposed to particular consequences but is totally opposed to the assumptions of the German political system; a sphere, finally, which cannot emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all the other spheres of society, without, therefore, emancipating all these other spheres, which is, in short, a <span class="c1">total loss</span> of humanity and which can only redeem itself by a <span class="c1">total redemption of humanity</span>. This dissolution of society, as a particular class, is the <span class="c1">proletariat</span>.</p><p class="s8">The proletariat is only beginning to form itself in Germany, as a result of the industrial movement. For what constitutes the proletariat is not <span class="c1">naturally existing</span> poverty, but poverty <span class="c1">artificially produced</span>, is not the mass of people mechanically oppressed by the weight of society, but the mass resulting from the <span class="c1">disintegration</span> of society and above all from the disintegration of the middle class. Needless to say, however, the numbers of the proletariat are also increased by the victims of natural poverty and of Christian-Germanic serfdom.</p><p class="s8">When the proletariat announces the <span class="c1">dissolution of the existing social order</span>, it only declares the <span class="c1">secret of its</span> own existence, for it <span class="c1">is</span> the <span class="c1">effective</span> dissolution of this order. When the proletariat demands the <span class="c1">negation of private property</span> it only lays down as a <span class="c1">principle for society</span> what society has already made a principle <span class="c1">for the proletariat</span>, and what the <span class="c1">latte</span>r already involuntarily embodies as the negative result of society. Thus the proletarian has the same right, in relation to the new world which is coming into being, as the <span class="c1">German king</span> has in relation to the existing world when he calls the people <span class="c1">his</span> people or a horse <span class="c1">his</span> horse. In calling the people his private property the king simply declares that the owner of private property is king.</p><p class="s8">Just as philosophy finds its <span class="c1">material</span> weapons in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its <span class="c1">intellectual</span> weapons in philosophy. And once the lightning of thought has penetrated deeply into this virgin soil of the people, the <span class="c1">Germans </span>will emancipate themselves and become <span class="c1">men</span>.</p><p class="s8">Let us sum up these results. The emancipation of Germany is only possible <span class="c1">in practice</span> if one adopts the point of view of that theory according to which man is the highest being for man. Germany will not be able to emancipate itself from the <span class="c1">Middle Ages</span> unless it emancipates itself at the same time from the <span class="c1">partial</span> victories over the Middle Ages. In Germany <span class="c1">no</span> type of enslavement can be abolished unless <span class="c1">all</span> enslavement is destroyed. Germany, which likes to get to the bottom of things, can only make a revolution which upsets the <span class="c1">whole order</span> of things. The <span class="c1">emancipation of Germany</span> will be an <span class="c1">emancipation of man. Philosophy</span> is the <span class="c1">head</span> of this emancipation and the <span class="c1">proletariat</span> is its <span class="c1">heart</span>. Philosophy can only be realized by the abolition<a id="footnote-ref97" href="part0057.html#footnote97" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">97</sup></span></a> of the proletariat, and <span class="c8">the proletariat can only be abolished by the realization of philosophy.</span></p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">When all the inner conditions ripen, <span class="c9">the day of German resurrection</span> will be proclaimed by <span class="c9">the crowing of the Gallic cock</span><span class="c8">.</span><a id="footnote-ref98" href="part0057.html#footnote98" class="calibre8"><span class="c8"><sup class="calibre9">98</sup></span></a></p>
