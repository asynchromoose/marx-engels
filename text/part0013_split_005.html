In what manner the object exists for them, is the characteristic mode of their <span class="c1">gratification</span>.</p><p class="s8">(2) Whenever the sensuous affirmation is the direct annulment of the object in its independent form (as in eating, drinking, working up of the object, etc.), this is the affirmation of the object.</p><p class="s8">(3) In so far as man, and hence also his feeling, etc., are <span class="c1">human</span>, the affirmation of the object by another is likewise his own enjoyment.</p><p class="s8">(4) Only through developed industry—i.e., through the medium of private property—does the ontological essence of human passion come to be both in its totality and in its humanity; the science of man is therefore itself a product of man’s establishment of himself by practical activity.</p><p class="s8">(5) The meaning of private property—liberated from its estrangement—is the existence of <span class="c1">essential objects</span> for man, both as objects of enjoyment and as objects of activity.</p><p class="s8">By possessing the <span class="c1">property</span> of buying everything, by possessing the property of appropriating all objects, <span class="c1">money</span> is thus the <span class="c1">object</span> of eminent possession.

To understand him, let us begin, first of all, by expounding the passage from Goethe.</p><p class="s8">That which is for me through the medium of <span class="c1">money</span>—that for which I can pay (i.e., which money can buy)—that am <span class="c1">I,</span> the possessor of the money. The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power. Money’s properties are my properties and essential powers—the properties and powers of its possessor. Thus, what I <span class="c1">am</span> and <span class="c1">am capable</span> of is by no means determined by my individuality. I am ugly, but I can buy for myself the most <span class="c1">beautiful</span> of women. Therefore I am not <span class="c1">ugly</span>, for the effect of <span class="c1">ugliness</span>—its deterrent power—is nullified by money. I, in my character as an individual, am <span class="c1">lame</span>, but money furnishes me with twenty-four feet. Therefore I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and therefore so is its possessor. Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good. Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest. I am <span class="c1">stupid</span>, but money is the <span class="c1">real mind</span> of all things and how then should its possessor be stupid? Besides, he can buy talented people for himself, and is he who has power over the talented not more talented than the talented? Do not I, who thanks to money am capable of <span class="c1">all</span> that the human heart longs for, possess all human capacities? Does not my money therefore transform all my incapacities into their contrary?</p><p class="s8">If <span class="c1">money</span> is the bond binding me to <span class="c1">human</span> life, binding society to me, binding me and nature and man, is not money the bond of all <span class="c1">bonds?</span> Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, the universal <span class="c1">agent of divorce?</span> It is the true <span class="c1">agent of divorce</span> as well as the true <span class="c1">binding agent—</span>the [universal]<a id="footnote-ref129" href="part0057.html#footnote129" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">129</sup></span></a> <span class="c1">galvano-chemical</span> power of Society.</p><p class="s8">Shakespeare stresses especially two properties of money:</p><p class="s8">(1) It is the visible divinity—the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and overturning of things: it makes brothers of impossibilities. (2) It is the common whore, the common pimp of people and nations.</p><p class="s8">The overturning and confounding of all human and natural qualities, the fraternization of impossibilities—the <span class="c1">divine</span> power of money—lies in its <span class="c1">character</span> as men’s estranged, alienating and self-disposing <span class="c1">species-nature</span>. Money is the alienated <span class="c1">ability of man-kind</span>.</p><p class="s8">That which I am unable to do as a <span class="c1">man</span>, and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable, I am able to do by means of <span class="c1">money</span>. Money thus turns each of these powers into something which in itself it is not—turns it, that is, into its contrary.</p><p class="s8">If I long for a particular dish or want to take the mail-coach because I am not strong enough to go by foot, money fetches me the dish and the mail-coach: that is, it converts my wishes from something in the realm of imagination, translates them from their meditated, imagined or willed existence into their <span class="c1">sensuous, actual</span> existence—from imagination to life, from imagined being into real being. In effecting this mediation, money is the <span class="c1">truly creative</span> power.</p><p class="s8">No doubt <span class="c1">demand</span> also exists for him who has no money, but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me, for a third party, for the others, and which therefore remains for me <span class="c1">unreal</span> and <span class="c1">objectless</span>. The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need, my passion, my wish, etc., is the difference between <span class="c1">being</span> and <span class="c1">thinking</span>, between the imagined which <span class="c1">exists</span> merely within me and the imagined as it is for me outside me as <span class="c1">a real object</span>.</p><p class="s8">If I have no money for travel, I have no <span class="c1">need</span>—that is, no real and self-realizing need—to travel. If I have the <span class="c1">vocation</span> for study but no money for it, I have <span class="c1">no</span> vocation for study—that is, <span class="c1">no effective</span>, no <span class="c1">true</span> vocation. On the other hand, if I have really <span class="c1">no</span> vocation for study but have the will <span class="c1">and</span> the money for it, I have an <span class="c1">effective</span> vocation for it. Being the external, common <span class="c1">medium</span> and <span class="c1">faculty</span> for turning an <span class="c1">image</span> into <span class="c1">reality</span> and <span class="c1">reality</span> into a mere <span class="c1">image</span> (a faculty not springing from man as man or from human society as society), <span class="c1">money</span> transforms the real <span class="c1">essential powers of man and nature</span> into what are merely abstract conceits and therefore <span class="c1">imperfections</span>—into tormenting chimeras—just as it transforms <span class="c1">real imperfections</span> <span class="c1">and chimeras</span>—essential powers which are really impotent, which exist only in the imagination of the individual—into <span class="c1">real powers</span> and <span class="c1">faculties</span>.</p><p class="s8">In the light of this characteristic alone, money is thus the general overturning of <span class="c1">individualities</span> which turns them into their contrary and adds contradictory attributes to their attributes.</p><p class="s8">Money, then, appears as this <span class="c1">overturning</span> power both against the individual and against the bonds of society, etc., which claim to be essences in themselves. It transforms fidelity into infidelity, love into hate, hate into love, virtue into vice, vice into virtue, servant into master, master into servant, idiocy into intelligence and intelligence into idiocy. </p><p class="s8">Since money, as the existing and active concept of value, confounds and exchanges all things, it is the general <span class="c1">confounding</span> and <span class="c1">compounding </span>of all things—the world upside-down—the confounding and compounding of all natural and human qualities.</p><p class="s8">He who can buy bravery is brave, though a coward. As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality, for any one specific thing, or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every property for every other, even contradictory, property and object: it is the fraternization of impossibilities. It makes contradictions embrace.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_10">Assume <span class="c1">man</span> to be <span class="c1">man</span> and his relationship to the world to be a human one: then you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc. If you want to enjoy art, you must be an artistically cultivated person; if you want to exercise influence over other people, you must be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people. Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a <span class="c1">specific expression</span>, corresponding to the object of your will, of your <span class="c1">real individual</span> life. If you love without evoking love in return—that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a <span class="c1">living expression</span> of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a <span class="c1">loved person</span>, then your love is impotent—a misfortune.</p>
