We have accepted its language and its laws. We presupposed private property, the separation of labour, capital and land, and of wages, profit of capital and rent of land—likewise division of labour, competition, the concept of exchange-value, etc. On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sink to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched of commodities that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production; that the necessary result of competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands, and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form; that finally the distinction between capitalist and land-rentier, like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory-worker, disappears and that the whole of society must fall apart into the two classes—the property-<span class="c1">owners</span> and—the propertyless <span class="c1">workers</span>. </p><p class="s8"> Political economy proceeds from the fact of private property, but it does not explain it to us. It expresses in general, abstract formulae the <span class="c1">material</span> process through which private property actually passes, and these formulae it then takes for <span class="c1">laws</span>. It does not <span class="c1">comprehend</span> these laws—i.e., it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property. Political economy does not disclose the source of the division between labour and capital, and between capital and land. When, for example, it defines the relationship of wages to profit, it takes the interest of the capitalists to be the ultimate cause; i.e., it takes for granted what it is supposed to evolve. Similarly, competition comes in everywhere. It is explained from external circumstances. As to how far these external and apparently fortuitous circumstances are but the expression of a necessary course of development, political economy teaches us nothing. We have seen how, to it, exchange itself appears to be a fortuitous fact. The only wheels which political economy sets in motion are <span class="c1">avarice</span> and the <span class="c1">war amongst the avaricious—competition</span>.</p><p class="s8">Precisely because political economy does not grasp the connections within the movement, it was possible to counterpose, for instance, the doctrine of competition to the doctrine of monopoly, the doctrine of craft-liberty to the doctrine of the corporation, the doctrine of the division of landed property to the doctrine of the big estate—for competition, craft-liberty and the division of landed property were explained and comprehended only as fortuitous, premeditated and violent consequences of monopoly, the corporation, and feudal property, not as their necessary, inevitable and natural consequences.</p><p class="s8">Now, therefore, we have to grasp the essential connection between private property, avarice, and the separation of labour, capital and landed property; between exchange and competition, value and the devaluation of men, monopoly and competition, etc.; the connection between this whole estrangement and the <span class="c1">money</span>-system.</p><p class="s8">Do not let us go back to a fictitious primordial condition as the political economist does, when he tries to explain. Such a primordial condition explains nothing. He merely pushes the question away into a grey nebulous distance. He assumes in the form of fact, of an event, what he is supposed to deduce—namely, the necessary relationship between two things—between, for example, division of labour and exchange. Theology in the same way explains the origin of evil by the fall of man: that is, it assumes as a fact, in historical form, what has to be done.</p><p class="s8">We proceed from an <span class="c1">actual</span> economic fact.</p><p class="s8">The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the <span class="c1">increasing value</span> of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion the <span class="c1">devaluation</span> of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a <span class="c1">commodity</span>—and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally. </p><p class="s8">This fact expresses merely that the object which labour produces—labour’s product—confronts it as <span class="c1">something alien</span>, as a <span class="c1">power independent</span> of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been congealed in an object, which has become material: it is the <span class="c1">objectification</span> of labour. Labour’s realization is its objectification. In the conditions dealt with by political economy this realization of labour appears as <span class="c1">loss of reality</span> for the workers; objectification as <span class="c1">loss of the object</span> and <span class="c1">object-bondage;</span> appropriation as <span class="c1">estrangement</span>, as <span class="c1">alienation</span>.<a id="footnote-ref112" href="part0057.html#footnote112" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">112</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">So much does labour’s realization appear as loss of reality that the worker loses reality to the point of starving to death. So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker is robbed of the objects most necessary not only for his life but for his work. Indeed, labour itself becomes an object which he can get hold of only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions. So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the dominion of his product, capital. </p><p class="s8">All these consequences are contained in the definition that the worker is related to the <span class="c1">product of his labour</span> as to an <span class="c1">alien</span> object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful the alien objective world becomes which he creates over-against himself, the poorer he himself—his inner world—becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the greater is the worker’s lack of objects. Whatever the product of his labour is, he is not. Therefore the greater this product, the less is he himself. The <span class="c1">alienation</span> of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an <span class="c1">external </span>existence, but that it <span class="c1">exists outside him</span>, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power of its own confronting him; it means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.</p><p class="s8">Let us now look more closely at the <span class="c1">objectification,</span> at the production of the worker; and therein at the <span class="c1">estrangement</span>, the <span class="c1">loss</span> of the object, his product. </p><p class="s8">The worker can create nothing without <span class="c1">nature</span>, without the <span class="c1">sensuous external world</span>. It is the material on which his labor is manifested, in which it is active, from which and by means of which it produces.</p><p class="s8">But just as nature provides labor with the <span class="c1">means of life</span> in the sense that labour cannot <span class="c1">live</span> without objects on which to operate, on the other hand, it also provides the <span class="c1">means of life</span> in the more restricted sense—i.e., the means for the physical subsistence of the <span class="c1">worker</span> himself.</p><p class="s8">Thus the more the worker by his labour <span class="c1">appropriates</span> the external world, sensuous nature, the more he deprives himself of <span class="c1">means of life</span> in the double respect; first, that the sensuous external world more and more ceases to be an object belonging to his labour—to be his labour’s <span class="c1">means of life;</span> and secondly, that it more and more ceases to be <span class="c1">means of life</span> in the immediate sense, means for the physical subsistence of the worker.</p><p class="s8">Thus in this double respect the worker becomes a slave of his object, first, in that he receives an <span class="c1">object of labour,</span> i.e., in that he receives <span class="c1">work;</span> and secondly, in that he receives <span class="c1">means of subsistence</span>. Therefore, it enables him to exist, first, as a <span class="c1">worker;</span> and, second, as a <span class="c1">physical subject.</span> The extremity of this bondage is that it is only as a <span class="c1">worker</span> that he continues to maintain himself as a <span class="c1">physical subject</span>, and that it is only as a <span class="c1">physical subject</span> that he is a <span class="c1">worker.</span></p><p class="s8">(The laws of political economy express the estrangement of the worker in his object thus: the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more values he creates, the more valueless, the more unworthy he becomes; the better formed his product, the more deformed becomes the worker; the more civilized his object, the more barbarous becomes the worker; the mightier labour becomes, the more powerless becomes the worker; the more ingenious labour becomes, the duller becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature’s bondsman.)</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labour by not considering the direct relationship between the worker </span>(labour)<span class="c1"> and production.</span> It is true that labour produces for the rich wonderful things—but for the worker it produces privation. It produces palaces—but for the worker, hovels. It produces beauty—but for the worker, deformity. It replaces labour by machines—but some of the workers it throws back to a barbarous type of labour, and the other workers it turns into machines. It produces intelligence—but for the worker idiocy, cretinism.</p><p class="s34">The direct relationship of labour to its produce is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production.<span class="c7"> The relationship of the man of means to the objects of production and to production itself is only a </span>consequence<span class="c7"> of this first relationship—and confirms it. We shall consider this other aspect later.</span></p><p class="s8">When we ask, then, what is the essential relationship of labour we are asking about the relationship of the <span class="c1">worker</span> to production.</p><p class="s8">Till now we have been considering the estrangement, the alienation of the worker only in one of its aspects, i.e., the <span class="c1">worker’s relationship to the products of his labour</span>. But the estrangement is manifested not only in the result but in the <span class="c1">act of production</span>—within the <span class="c1">producing activity</span> itself. How would the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger, were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from himself? The product is after all but the summary of the activity of production. If then the product of labour is alienation, production itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity, the activity of alienation. In the estrangement of the object of labour is merely summarized the estrangement, the alienation, in the activity of labour itself.</p><p class="s8">What, then, constitutes the alienation of labour? </p><p class="s8">First, the fact that labour is <span class="c1">external</span> to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is <span class="c1">forced labour</span>. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a <span class="c1">means</span> to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself, is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else’s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual—that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity—in the same way the worker’s activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.</p><p class="s8">As a result, therefore, man (the worker) no longer feels himself to be freely active in any but his animal functions—eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.</p><p class="s8">Certainly eating, drinking, procreating, etc., are also genuinely human functions. But in the abstraction which separates them from the sphere of all other human activity and turns them into sole and ultimate ends, they are animal.</p><p class="s8">We have considered the act of estranging practical human activity, labour, in two of its aspects. (1) The relation of the worker to the <span class="c1">product of labour</span> as an alien object exercising power over him. This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world, to the objects of nature as an alien world antagonistically opposed to him. (2) The relation of labour to the <span class="c1">act of production</span> within the <span class="c1">labour </span>process. This relation is the relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker’s <span class="c1">own</span> physical and mental energy, his personal life or what is life other than activity—as an activity which is turned against him, neither depends on nor belongs to him. Here we have <span class="c1">self-estrangement,</span> as we had previously the estrangement of the <span class="c1">thing.</span> </p><p class="s8">We have yet a third aspect of <span class="c1">estranged labour</span> to deduce from the two already considered.</p><p class="s8">Man is a species being, not only because in practice and in theory he adopts the species as his object (his own as well as those of other things), but—and this is only another way of expressing it—but also because he treats himself as the actual, living species; because he treats himself as a <span class="c1">universal</span> and therefore a free being.</p><p class="s8"> The life of the species, both in man and in animals, consists physically in the fact that man (like the animal) lives on inorganic nature; and the more universal man is compared with an animal, the more universal is the sphere of inorganic nature on which he lives. Just as plants, animals, stones, the air, light, etc., constitute a part of human consciousness in the realm of theory, partly as objects of natural science, partly as objects of art—his spiritual inorganic nature, spiritual nourishment which he must first prepare to make it palatable and digestible—so too in the realm of practice they constitute a part of human life and human activity. Physically man lives only on these products of nature, whether they appear in the form of food, heating, clothes, a dwelling, or whatever it may be. The universality of man is in practice manifested precisely in the universality which makes all nature his <span class="c1">inorganic</span> body—both inasmuch as nature is (1) his direct means of life, and (2) the material, the object, and the instrument of his life-activity. Nature is man’s <span class="c1">inorganic body</span>—nature, that is, in so far as it is not itself the human body. Man <span class="c1">lives</span> on nature—means that nature is his <span class="c1">body</span>, with which he must remain in continuous intercourse if he is not to die. That man’s physical and spiritual life is linked to nature means simply that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part of nature.</p><p class="s8">In estranging from man (1) nature, and (2) himself, his own active functions, his life-activity, estranged labour estranges the <span class="c1">species</span> from man. It turns for him the <span class="c1">life of the species</span> into a means of individual life. First it estranges the life of the species and individual life, and secondly it makes individual life in its abstract form the purpose of the life of the species, likewise in its abstract and estranged form.</p><p class="s8">For in the first place labour, <span class="c1">life-activity, productive life</span> itself, appears to man merely as a <span class="c1">means</span> of satisfying a need—the need to maintain the physical existence. Yet the productive life is the life of the species. It is life-engendering life. The whole character of a species—its species character—is contained in the character of its life-activity; and free, conscious activity is man’s species character. Life itself appears only as <span class="c1">a</span> <span class="c1">means to life.</span></p><p class="s8">The animal is immediately identical with its life-activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is <span class="c1">its life-activity</span>. Man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life-activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life-activity directly distinguishes man from animal life-activity. It is just because of this that he is a species being. Or it is only because he is a species being that he is a Conscious Being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses this relationship, so that it is just because man is a conscious being that he makes his life-activity, his <span class="c1">essential</span> being, a mere means to his <span class="c1">existence.</span> </p><p class="s8">In creating an <span class="c1">objective world</span> by his practical activity, in <span class="c1">working-up</span> inorganic nature, man proves himself a conscious species being, i.e., as a being that treats the species as its own essential being, or that treats itself as a species being. Admittedly animals also produce. They build themselves nests, dwellings, like the bees, beavers, ants, etc. But an animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, whilst man produces universally. It produces only under the dominion of immediate physical need, whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom. An animal produces only itself, whilst man reproduces the whole of nature. An animal’s product belongs immediately to its physical body, whilst man freely confronts his product. An animal forms things in accordance with the standard and the need of the species to which it belongs, whilst man knows how to produce in accordance with the standard of every species, and knows how to apply everywhere the inherent standard to the object. Man therefore also forms things in accordance with the laws of beauty.</p><p class="s8">It is just in the working-up of the objective world, therefore, that man first really proves himself to be a <span class="c1">species being</span>. This production is his active species life. Through and because of this production, nature appears as <span class="c1">his</span> work and his reality. The object of labour is, therefore, the <span class="c1">objectification of man’s species life:</span> for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he contemplates himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labour tears from him his <span class="c1">species life,</span> his real species objectivity, and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken from him.</p><p class="s8"> Similarly, in degrading spontaneous activity, free activity, to a means, estranged labour makes man’s species life a means to his physical existence.</p><p class="s8">The consciousness which man has of his species is thus transformed by estrangement in such a way that the species life becomes for him a means. </p><p class="s8">Estranged labour turns thus:</p><p class="s8">(3) <span class="c1">Man’s species being,</span> both nature and his spiritual species property, into a being <span class="c1">alien</span> to him, into a <span class="c1">means</span> to his <span class="c1">individual existence</span>. It estranges man’s own body from him, as it does external nature and his spiritual essence, his <span class="c1">human</span> being.</p><p class="s8">(4) An immediate consequence of the fact that man is estranged from the product of his labour, from his life-activity, from his species being is the <span class="c1">estrangement of man from man.</span> If a man is confronted by himself, he is confronted by the <span class="c1">other</span> man. What applies to a man’s relation to his work, to the product of his labour and to himself, also holds of a man’s relation to the other man, and to the other man’s labour and object of labour.</p><p class="s8">In fact, the proposition that man’s species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other, as each of them is from man’s essential nature.<a id="footnote-ref113" href="part0057.html#footnote113" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">113</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">The estrangement of man, and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself, is first realized and expressed in the relationship in which a man stands to other men.</p><p class="s8">Hence within the relationship of estranged labour each man views the other in accordance with the standard and the position in which he finds himself as a worker.</p><p class="s8">We took our departure from a fact of political economy—the estrangement of the worker and his production. We have formulated the concept of this fact—<span class="c1">estranged, alienated</span> labour. We have analysed this concept—hence analysing merely a fact of political economy.</p><p class="s8">Let us now see, further, how in real life the concept of estranged, alienated labour must express and present itself. </p><p class="s8">If the product of labour is alien to me, if it confronts me as an alien power, to whom, then, does it belong? </p><p class="s8">If my own activity does not belong to me, if it is an alien, a coerced activity, to whom, then, does it belong? </p><p class="s8">To a being <span class="c1">other</span> than me.</p><p class="s8">Who is this being? </p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">gods?</span> To be sure, in the earliest times the principal production (for example, the building of temples, etc., in Egypt, India and Mexico) appears to be in the service of the gods, and the product belongs to the gods. However, the gods on their own were never the lords of labour. No more was <span class="c1">nature</span>. And what a contradiction it would be if, the more man subjugated nature by his labour and the more the miracles of the gods were rendered superfluous by the miracles of industry, the more man were to renounce the joy of production and the enjoyment of the product in favour of these powers.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">alien</span> being, to whom labour and the produce of labour belongs, in whose service labour is done and for whose benefit the produce of labour is provided, can only be <span class="c1">man</span> himself.</p><p class="s8">If the product of labour does not belong to the worker, if it confronts him as an alien power, this can only be because it belongs to some <span class="c1">other man than the worker</span>. If the worker’s activity is a torment to him, to another it must be <span class="c1">delight</span> and his life’s joy. Not the gods, not nature, but only man himself can be this alien power over man.</p><p class="s8">We must bear in mind the above-stated proposition that man’s relation to himself only becomes <span class="c1">objective</span> and <span class="c1">real</span> for him through his relation to the other man. Thus, if the product of his labour, his labour <span class="c1">objectified</span>, is for him an <span class="c1">alien</span>, hostile, powerful object independent of him, then his position towards it is such that someone else is master of this object, someone who is alien, hostile, powerful, and independent of him. If his own activity is to him an unfree activity, then he is treating it as activity performed in the service, under the dominion, the coercion and the yoke of another man.</p><p class="s8">Every self-estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself. For this reason religious self-estrangement necessarily appears in the relationship of the layman to the priest, or again to a mediator, etc., since we are here dealing with the intellectual world. In the real practical world self-estrangement can only become manifest through the real practical relationship to other men. The medium through which estrangement takes place is itself <span class="c1">practical</span>. Thus through estranged labour man not only engenders his relationship to the object and to the act of production as to powers that are alien and hostile to him; he also engenders the relationship in which other men stand to his production and to his product, and the relationship in which he stands to these other men. Just as he begets his own production as the loss of his reality, as his punishment; just as he begets his own product as a loss, as a product not belonging to him; so he begets the dominion of the one who does not produce over production and over the product. Just as he estranges from himself his own activity, so he confers to the stranger activity which is not his own.</p><p class="s8">Till now we have only considered this relationship from the standpoint of the worker and later we shall be considering it also from the standpoint of the non-worker.</p><p class="s8">Through <span class="c1">estranged, alienated labour,</span> then, the worker produces the relationship to this labour of a man alien to labour and standing outside it. The relationship of the worker to labour engenders the relation to it of the capitalist, or whatever one chooses to call the master of labour. <span class="c1">Private property</span> is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence, of <span class="c1">alienated labour,</span> of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Private property</span> thus results by analysis from the concept of <span class="c1">alienated labour</span>—i.e., of <span class="c1">alienated man</span>, of estranged labour, of estranged life, of <span class="c1">estranged </span>man.</p><p class="s8">True, it is as a result of the <span class="c1">movement of private property</span> that we have obtained the concept of <span class="c1">alienated labour (of alienated life)</span> from political economy. But on analysis of this concept it becomes clear that though private property appears to be the source, the cause of alienated labour, it is really its consequence, just as the gods <span class="c1">in the beginning</span> are not the cause but the effect of man’s intellectual confusion. Later this relationship becomes reciprocal.</p><p class="s8">Only at the very culmination of the development of private property does this, its secret, re-emerge, namely, that on the one hand it is the <span class="c1">product</span> of alienated labour, and that secondly it is the <span class="c1">means</span> by which labour alienates itself, the <span class="c1">realization of this alienation.</span></p><p class="s8">This exposition immediately sheds light on various hitherto unsolved conflicts.</p><p class="s8">(1) Political economy starts from labour as the real soul of production; yet to labour it gives nothing, and to private property everything. From this contradiction Proudhon has concluded in favour of labour and against private property. We understand, however, that this apparent contradiction is the contradiction of <span class="c1">estranged labour</span> with itself, and that political economy has merely formulated the laws of estranged labour.</p><p class="s8">We also understand, therefore, that <span class="c1">wages </span>and <span class="c1">private property</span> are identical: where the product, the object of labour pays for labour itself, the wage is but a necessary consequence of labour’s estrangement, for after all in the wage of labour, labour does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage. We shall develop this point later, and meanwhile will only deduce some conclusions.</p><p class="s8">A <span class="c1">forcing-up of wages</span> (disregarding all other difficulties, including the fact that it would only be by force, too, that the higher wages, being an anomaly, could be maintained) would therefore be nothing but <span class="c1">better payment for the slave</span>, and would not conquer either for the worker or for labour their human status and dignity.</p><p class="s8">Indeed, even the <span class="c1">equality of wages</span> demanded by Proudhon only transforms the relationship of the present-day worker to his labour into the relationship of all men to labour. Society is then conceived as an abstract capitalist.</p><p class="s8">Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labour, and estranged labour is the direct cause of private property. The downfall of the one aspect must therefore mean the downfall of the other.</p><p class="s8">(2) From the relationship of estranged labour to private property it further follows that the emancipation of society from private property, etc., from servitude, is expressed in the <span class="c1">political</span> form of the <span class="c1">emancipation of the workers;</span> not that <span class="c1">their</span> emancipation alone was at stake but because the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation—and it contains this, because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production, and every relation of servitude is but a modification and consequence of this relation.</p><p class="s8"> Just as we have found the concept of <span class="c1">private property</span> from the concept of <span class="c1">estranged, alienated labour</span> by <span class="c1">analysis</span>, in the same way every <span class="c1">category</span> of political economy can be evolved with the help of these two factors; and we shall find again in each category, e.g., trade, competition, capital, money, only a <span class="c1">definite</span> and <span class="c1">developed expression</span> of the first foundations.</p><p class="s8">Before considering this configuration, however, let us try to solve two problems.</p><p class="s8">(1) To define the general <span class="c1">nature of private property</span>, as it has arisen as a result of estranged labour, in its relation to <span class="c1">truly human, social property</span>.</p><p class="s8">(2) We have accepted the <span class="c1">estrangement of labour</span>, its <span class="c1">alienation</span>, as a fact, and we have analysed this fact. How, we now ask, does <span class="c1">man</span> come to <span class="c1">alienate</span>, to estrange, <span class="c1">his labour?</span> How is this estrangement rooted in the nature of human development? We have already gone a long way to the solution of this problem by <span class="c1">transforming</span> the question as to the <span class="c1">origin of private property</span> into the question as to the relation of <span class="c1">alienated labour</span> to the course of humanity’s development. For when one speaks of <span class="c1">private property</span>, one thinks of being concerned with something external to man. When one speaks of labour, one is directly concerned with man himself. This new formulation of the question already contains its solution.</p><p class="s34">As to (1): The general nature of private property and its relation to truly human property.</p><p class="s8">Alienated labour has resolved itself for us into two elements which mutually condition one another, or which are but different expressions of one and the same relationship. <span class="c1">Appropriation</span> appears <span class="c1">as estrangement</span>, as <span class="c1">alienation;</span> and <span class="c1">alienation</span> appears <span class="c1">as appropriation, estrangement </span>as true <span class="c1">enfranchisement.</span></p><p class="s8">We have considered the one side—<span class="c1">alienated</span> labour in relation to the worker himself, i.e., the <span class="c1">relation of alienated labour to itself.</span> The <span class="c1">property-relation of the non-worker to the worker and to labour</span> we have found as the product, the necessary outcome of this relation of alienated labour. <span class="c1">Private property</span>, as the material, summary expression of alienated labour, embraces both relations—the <span class="c1">relation of the worker to work, to the product of his labour and to the non-worker,</span> and the relation of the <span class="c1">non-worker to the worker and to the product of his labour.</span></p><p class="s8">Having seen that in relation to the worker who <span class="c1">appropriate</span> nature by means of his labour, this appropriation <span class="c1">appears</span> as estrangement, his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as activity of another, vitality as a sacrifice of life, production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power, to an <span class="c1">alien</span> person—we shall now consider the relation to the worker, to labour and its object of this person who is <span class="c1">alien</span> to labour and the worker.</p><p class="s8">First it has to be noticed, that everything which appears in the worker as an <span class="c1">activity of alienation, of estrangement</span>, appears in the non-worker as a <span class="c1">state of alienation, of estrangement.</span></p><p class="s8">Secondly, that the worker’s <span class="c1">real, practical attitude</span> in production and to the product (as a state of mind) appears in the non-worker confronting him as a <span class="c1">theoretical</span> attitude.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Thirdly,</span> the non-worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself; but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_4">Let us look more closely at these three relations.<a id="footnote-ref114" href="part0057.html#footnote114" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">114</sup></span></a></p>
