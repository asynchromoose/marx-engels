How would European revolution be affected by and affect developments elsewhere? A letter of October 8, 1858, to Engels reflected Marx’s uneasiness on this score. A much later letter, from Engels to Karl Kautsky on September 12, 1882, voiced a more sanguine view in the suggestion that a socialist Europe and North America would lead the rest of the world to socialist revolution by force of example.</p>
