<p class="s31"><span class="c4">1.	Bruno Bauer,</span> <span class="c5">Die Judenfrage</span><a id="footnote-ref49" href="part0057.html#footnote49" class="calibre2"><span class="c5"><sup class="calibre10">49</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">The German Jews seek emancipation. What kind of emancipation do they want? <span class="c1">Civic, political</span> emancipation.</p><p class="s8">Bruno Bauer replies to them: In Germany no one is politically emancipated. We ourselves are not free. How then could we liberate you? You Jews are <span class="c1">egoists</span> if you demand for yourselves, as Jews, a special emancipation. You should work, as Germans, for the political emancipation of Germany, and as men, for the emancipation of mankind. You should feel the particular kind of oppression and shame which you suffer, not as an exception to the rule but rather as a confirmation of the rule.</p><p class="s8">Or do the Jews want to be placed on a footing of equality with the <span class="c1">Christian subjects?</span> If they recognize the <span class="c1">Christian state</span> as legally established they also recognize the régime of general enslavement. Why should their particular yoke be irksome when they accept the general yoke? Why should the German be interested in the liberation of the Jew, if the Jew is not interested in the liberation of the German?</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">Christian </span>state recognizes nothing but <span class="c1">privileges</span>. The Jew himself, in this state, has the privilege of being a Jew. As a Jew he possesses rights which the Christians do not have. Why does he want rights which he does not have but which the Christians enjoy?</p><p class="s8">In demanding his emancipation from the Christian state he asks the Christian state to abandon its <span class="c1">religious</span> prejudice. But does he, the Jew, give up <span class="c1">his</span> religious prejudice? Has he then the right to insist that someone else should forswear his religion?</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">Christian</span> state, <span class="c1">by its very nature</span>, is incapable of emancipating the Jew. But, adds Bauer, the Jew, by his very nature, cannot be emancipated. As long as the state remains Christian, and as long as the Jew remains a Jew, they are equally incapable, the one of conferring emancipation, the other of receiving it.</p><p class="s8">With respect to the Jews the Christian state can only adopt the attitude of a Christian state. That is, it can permit the Jew, as a matter of privilege, to isolate himself from its other subjects; but it must then allow the pressures of all the other spheres of society to bear upon the Jew, and all the more heavily since he is in religious opposition to the dominant religion. But the Jew likewise can only adopt a Jewish attitude, i.e. that of a foreigner, towards the state, since he opposes his illusory nationality to actual nationality, his illusory law to actual law. He considers it his right to separate himself from the rest of humanity; as a matter of principle he takes no part in the historical movement and looks to a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind as a whole. He regards himself as a member of the Jewish people, and the Jewish people as the chosen people.</p><p class="s8">On what grounds, then, do you Jews demand emancipation? On account of your religion? But it is the mortal enemy of the state religion. As citizens? But there are no citizens in Germany. As men? But you are not men any more than are those to whom you appeal. </p><p class="s8">Bauer, after criticizing earlier approaches and solutions, formulates the question of Jewish emancipation in a new way. What, he asks, is the <span class="c1">nature</span> of the Jew who is to be emancipated, and the nature of the Christian state which is to emancipate him? He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion, analyses the religious opposition between Judaism and Christianity, explains the essence of the Christian state; and does all this with dash, clarity, wit and profundity, in a style which is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous.</p><p class="s8">How then does Bauer resolve the Jewish question? What is the result? To formulate a question is to resolve it. The critical study of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question. Here it is in brief: we have to emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others.</p><p class="s8">The most stubborn form of the opposition between Jew and Christian is the <span class="c1">religious</span> opposition. How is an opposition resolved? By making it impossible. And how is <span class="c1">religious</span> opposition made impossible? By abolishing <span class="c1">religion</span>. As soon as Jew and Christian come to see in their respective religions nothing more than <span class="c1">stages in the development of the human mind</span>—snake skins which have been cast off by <span class="c1">history</span>, and <span class="c1">man</span> as the snake who clothed himself in them—they will no longer find themselves in religious opposition, but in a purely critical, <span class="c1">scientific</span> and human relationship. <span class="c1">Science</span> will then constitute their unity. But scientific oppositions are resolved by science itself.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">German</span> Jew, in particular, suffers from the general lack of political freedom and the pronounced Christianity of the state. But in Bauer’s sense the Jewish question has a general significance, independent of the specifically German conditions. It is the question of the relations between religion and the state, of the <span class="c1">contradiction between religious prejudice and political emancipation</span>. Emancipation from religion is posited as a condition, both for the Jew who wants political emancipation, and for the state which should emancipate him and itself be emancipated.</p><p class="s8">“Very well, it may be said (and the Jew himself says it) but the Jew should not be emancipated because he is a Jew, because he has such an excellent and universal moral creed; the <span class="c1">Jew</span> should take second place to the citizen, and he will be a <span class="c1">citizen</span> although he is and desires to remain a Jew. In other words, he is and remains a <span class="c1">Jew</span>, even though he is a <span class="c1">citizen</span> and as such lives in a universal human condition; his restricted Jewish nature always finally triumphs over his human and political obligations. The bias persists even though it is overcome by general principles. But if it persists, it would be truer to say that it overcomes all the rest.” “It is only in a sophistical and superficial sense that the Jew could remain a Jew in political life. Consequently, if he wanted to remain a Jew, this would mean that the superficial became the essential and thus triumphed. In other words, his life <span class="c1">in the state</span> would be only a semblance, or a momentary exception to the essential and normal.”<a id="footnote-ref50" href="part0057.html#footnote50" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">50</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Let us see also how Bauer establishes the role of the state.</p><p class="s8">“France,” he says, “has provided us recently,<a id="footnote-ref51" href="part0057.html#footnote51" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">51</sup></span></a> in connexion with the Jewish question (and for that matter all other <span class="c1">political</span> questions), with the spectacle of a life which is free but which revokes its freedom by law and so declares it to be merely an appearance; and which, on the other hand, denies its free laws by its acts.”<a id="footnote-ref52" href="part0057.html#footnote52" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">52</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">“In France, universal liberty is not yet established by law, nor is the <span class="c1">Jewish question as yet resolved</span>, because legal liberty, i.e. the equality of all citizens, is restricted in actual life, which is still dominated and fragmented by religious privileges, and because the lack of liberty in actual life influences law in its turn and obliges it to sanction the division of citizens who are by nature free into oppressors and oppressed.”<a id="footnote-ref53" href="part0057.html#footnote53" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">53</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">When, therefore, would the Jewish question be resolved in France?</p><p class="s8">“The Jew would really have ceased to be Jewish, for example, if he did not allow his religious code to prevent his fulfilment of his duties towards the state and his fellow citizens; if he attended and took part in the public business of the Chamber of Deputies on the sabbath. It would be necessary, further, to abolish all <span class="c1">religious privilege</span>, including the monopoly of a privileged church. If, thereafter, some or many or <span class="c1">even the overwhelming majority felt obliged to fulfil their religious duties</span>, such practices should be left to <span class="c1">them as an absolutely</span> private matter.”<a id="footnote-ref54" href="part0057.html#footnote54" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">54</sup></span></a> “There is no longer any religion when there is no longer a privileged religion. Take away from religion its power to excommunicate and it will no longer exist.”<a id="footnote-ref55" href="part0057.html#footnote55" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">55</sup></span></a> “Mr. Martin du Nord has seen, in the suggestion to omit any mention of Sunday in the law, a proposal to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist. With equal right (and the right is well founded) the declaration that the law of the sabbath is no longer binding upon the Jew would amount to proclaiming the end of Judaism.”<a id="footnote-ref56" href="part0057.html#footnote56" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">56</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Thus Bauer demands, on the one hand, that the Jew should renounce Judaism, and in general that man should renounce religion, in order to be emancipated as a citizen. On the other hand he considers, and this follows logically, that the political abolition of religion is the abolition of all religion. The state which presupposes religion is not yet a true or actual state. “Clearly, the religious idea gives some assurances to the state. But to what state? <span class="c1">To what kind of state?”</span><a id="footnote-ref57" href="part0057.html#footnote57" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">57</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">At this point we see that the Jewish question is considered only from one aspect. </p><p class="s8">It was by no means sufficient to ask: who should emancipate? who should be emancipated? The critic should ask a third question: <span class="c1">what kind of emancipation</span> is involved? What are the essential conditions of the emancipation which is demanded? The criticism of <span class="c1">political emancipation</span> itself was only the final criticism of the Jewish question and its genuine resolution into the <span class="c1">“general question of the age.”</span> </p><p class="s8">Bauer, since he does not formulate the problem at this level, falls into contradictions. He establishes conditions which are not based upon the nature of <span class="c1">political </span>emancipation. He raises questions which are irrelevant to his problem, and he resolves problems which leave his question unanswered. When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation that “Their error was simply to assume that the Christian state was the only true one, and not to subject it to the same criticism as Judaism,”<a id="footnote-ref58" href="part0057.html#footnote58" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">58</sup></span></a> we see his own error in the fact that he subjects <span class="c1">only</span> the ‘“Christian state,” and not the “state as such” to criticism, that he does not examine the <span class="c1">relation between political emancipation and human emancipation</span>, and that he, therefore, poses conditions which are only explicable by his lack of critical sense in confusing political emancipation and universal human emancipation. Bauer ask the Jews: Have you, from your standpoint, the right to demand <span class="c1">political emancipation?</span> We ask the converse question: from the standpoint of <span class="c1">political </span>emancipation can the Jew be required to abolish Judaism, or man be asked to abolish religion?</p><p class="s8"> The Jewish question presents itself differently according to the state in which the Jew resides. In Germany, where there is no political state, no state as such, the Jewish question is purely <span class="c1">theological</span>. The Jew finds himself in <span class="c1">religious</span> opposition to the state, which proclaims Christianity as its foundation. This state is a theologian <span class="c1">ex professo</span>. Criticism here is criticism of theology; a double-edged criticism, of Christian and of Jewish theology. And so we move always in the domain of theology, however <span class="c1">critically</span> we may move therein.</p><p class="s8">In France, which is a constitutional state, the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism, of the incompleteness of political emancipation Since the semblance of a state religion is maintained here, if only in the insignificant and self-contradictory formula of a religion of the majority, the relation, of the Jews to the state also retains a semblance of religious, theological opposition.</p><p class="s8">It is only in the free states of North America, or at least in some of them, that the Jewish question loses its <span class="c1">theological</span> significance and becomes a truly <span class="c1">secular</span> question. Only where the state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew, and of the religious man in general, to the political state appear in a pure form, with its own characteristics. The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism when the state ceases to maintain a <span class="c1">theological</span> attitude towards religion, that is, when it adopts the attitude of a state, i.e. a <span class="c1">political</span> attitude. Criticism then becomes <span class="c1">criticism of the political state</span>. And at this point, where the question ceases to be <span class="c1">theological</span>, Bauer’s criticism ceases to be critical.</p><p class="s8">“There is not, in the United States, either a state religion or a religion declared to be that of a majority, or a predominance of one religion over another. The state remains aloof from all religions.”<a id="footnote-ref59" href="part0057.html#footnote59" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">59</sup></span></a> There are even some states in North America in which the constitution does not impose any religious belief or practice as a condition of political rights.”<a id="footnote-ref60" href="part0057.html#footnote60" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">60</sup></span></a> And yet, “no one in the United States believes that a man without religion can be an honest man.”<a id="footnote-ref61" href="part0057.html#footnote61" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">61</sup></span></a> And North America is pre-eminently the country of religiosity, as Beaumont,<a id="footnote-ref62" href="part0057.html#footnote62" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">62</sup></span></a> Tocqueville<a id="footnote-ref63" href="part0057.html#footnote63" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">63</sup></span></a> and the Englishman, Hamilton,<a id="footnote-ref64" href="part0057.html#footnote64" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">64</sup></span></a> assure us in unison. However, the states of North America only serve as an example. The question is: what is the relation between <span class="c1">complete</span> political emancipation and religion? If we find in the country which has attained full political emancipation, that religion not only continues to <span class="c1">exist</span> but is <span class="c1">fresh</span> and <span class="c1">vigorous</span>, this is proof that the existence of religion is not at all opposed to the perfection of the state. But since the existence of religion is the existence of a defect, the source of this defect must be sought in the <span class="c1">nature</span> of the state itself. Religion no longer appears as the basis, but as the <span class="c1">manifestation</span> of secular narrowness. That is why we explain the religious constraints upon the free citizens by the secular constraints upon them. We do not claim that they must transcend their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular limitations. We claim that they will transcend their religious narrowness once they have overcome their secular limitations. We do not turn secular questions into theological questions; we turn theological questions into secular ones. History has for long enough been resolved into superstition; but we now resolve superstition into history. The question of the <span class="c1">relation between political emancipation and religion</span> becomes for us a question of the <span class="c1">relation between political emancipation and human emancipation</span>. We criticize the religious failings of the political state by criticizing the political state in its <span class="c1">secular</span> form, disregarding its religious failings. We express in human terms the contradiction between the state and a <span class="c1">particular religion</span>, for example <span class="c1">Judaism</span>, by showing the contradiction between the state and particular <span class="c1">secular elements</span>, between the state and <span class="c1">religion in general</span> and between the state and its general <span class="c1">presuppositions</span>.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">political</span> emancipation of the Jew or the Christian—of the <span class="c1">religious</span> man in general—is the <span class="c1">emancipation of</span> the state from Judaism, Christianity, and <span class="c1">religion</span> in general. The <span class="c1">state</span> emancipates itself from religion in its own particular way, in the mode which corresponds to its nature, by emancipating itself from the <span class="c1">state religion</span>; that is to say, by giving recognition to no religion and affirming itself purely and simply as a state. To be <span class="c1">politically</span> emancipated from religion is not to be finally and completely emancipated from religion, because political emancipation is not the final and absolute form of <span class="c1">human</span> emancipation. </p><p class="s8">The limits of political emancipation appear at once in the fact that the <span class="c1">state</span> can liberate itself from a constraint without man himself being <span class="c1">really</span> liberated; that a state may be a <span class="c1">free state</span> without man himself being a <span class="c1">free</span> <span class="c1">man</span>. Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he makes political emancipation depend upon the following condition—</p><p class="s8">“It would be necessary, moreover, to abolish all religious privileges, including the monopoly of a privileged church. If some people, or even the <span class="c1">immense majority, still felt obliged to fulfil their religious duties</span>, this practice should be left to them as a <span class="c1">completely private matter.</span>” Thus the state may have emancipated itself from religion, even though the <span class="c1">immense majority</span> of people continue to be religious. And the immense majority do not cease to be religious by virtue of being religious <span class="c1">in private</span>.</p><p class="s8">The attitude of the state, especially the <span class="c1">free state</span>, towards religion is only the attitude towards religion of the individuals who compose the state. It follows that man frees himself from a constraint in a <span class="c1">political</span> way, through the state, when he transcends his limitations, in contradiction with himself, and in an <span class="c1">abstract</span>, <span class="c1">narrow</span> and partial way. Furthermore, by emancipating himself <span class="c1">politically</span>, man emancipates himself in a <span class="c1">devious way</span>, through an intermediary, however <span class="c1">necessary</span> this intermediary may be. Finally, even when he proclaims himself an atheist through the intermediary of the state, that is, when he declares the state to be an atheist, he is still engrossed in religion, because he only recognizes himself as an atheist in a roundabout way, through an intermediary. Religion is simply the recognition of man in a roundabout fashion; that is, through an intermediary. The state is the intermediary between man and human liberty. Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man attributes all his own divinity and all his religious <span class="c1">bonds</span>, so the state is the intermediary to which man confides all his non-divinity and all his <span class="c1">human freedom</span>.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">political</span> elevation of man above religion shares the weaknesses and merits of all such political measures. For example, the state as a state abolishes <span class="c1">private property</span> (i.e. man decrees by <span class="c1">political</span> means the <span class="c1">abolition</span> of private property) when it abolishes the <span class="c1">property qualification</span> for electors and representatives, as has been done in many of the North American States. Hamilton interprets this phenomenon quite correctly from the political standpoint: <span class="c1">The masses have gained a victory over property owners and financial wealth.</span><a id="footnote-ref65" href="part0057.html#footnote65" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">65</sup></span></a> Is not private property ideally abolished when the non-owner comes to legislate for the owner of property? The <span class="c1">property qualification</span> is the last <span class="c1">political</span> form in which private property is recognized.</p><p class="s8">But the political suppression of private property not only does not abolish private property; it actually presupposes its existence. The state abolishes, after its fashion, the distinctions established by <span class="c1">birth, social rank, education, occupation,</span> when it decrees that birth, social rank, education, occupation are <span class="c1">non-political</span> distinctions; when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of society is an <span class="c1">equal</span> partner in popular sovereignty, and treats all the elements which compose the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. But the state, none the less, allows private property, education, occupation, to <span class="c1">act</span> after <span class="c1">their</span> own fashion, namely as private property, education, occupation, and to manifest their <span class="c1">particular</span> nature. Far from abolishing these <span class="c1">effective</span> differences, it only exists so far as they are presupposed; it is conscious of being a <span class="c1">political state</span> and it manifests its <span class="c1">universality</span> only in opposition to these elements. Hegel, therefore, defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says: “In order for the state to come in to existence as the <span class="c1">self-knowing</span> ethical actuality of spirit, it is essential that it should be distinct from the forms of authority and of faith. But this distinction emerges only in so far as divisions occur within the ecclesiastical sphere itself. It is only in this way that the state, above the <span class="c1">particular</span> churches, has attained to the universality of thought—its formal principle—and is bringing this universality into existence.”<a id="footnote-ref66" href="part0057.html#footnote66" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">66</sup></span></a> To be sure! Only in this manner, <span class="c1">above</span> the <span class="c1">particular</span> elements, can the state constitute itself as universality.</p><p class="s8">The perfected political state is, by its nature, the <span class="c1">species-life</span><a id="footnote-ref67" href="part0057.html#footnote67" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">67</sup></span></a> of man as <span class="c1">opposed</span> to his material life. All the presuppositions of this egoistic life continue to exist in <span class="c1">civil society outside</span> the political sphere, as qualities of civil society. Where the political state has attained to its full development, man leads, not only in thought, in consciousness, but in <span class="c1">reality</span>, in <span class="c1">life</span>, a double existence—celestial and terrestrial. He live in the <span class="c1">political community</span>, where he regards himself as a <span class="c1">communal being</span>, and in <span class="c1">civil society</span> where he acts simply as a <span class="c1">private individual</span>, treats other men as means, degrades himself to the role of a mere means, and becomes the plaything of alien powers. The political state, in relation to civil society, is just as spiritual as is heaven in relation to earth. It stands in the same opposition to civil society, and overcomes it in the same manner as religion overcomes the narrowness of the profane world; i.e. it has always to acknowledge it again, re-establish it, and allow itself to be dominated by it. Man, in his <span class="c1">most intimate</span> reality, in civil society, is a profane being. Here, where he appears both to himself and to others as a real individual he is an <span class="c1">illusory</span> phenomenon. In the state, on the contrary, where he is regarded as a species-being,<a id="footnote-ref68" href="part0057.html#footnote68" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">68</sup></span></a> man is the imaginary member of an imaginary sovereignty, divested of his real, individual life, and infused with an unreal universality.</p><p class="s8">The conflict in which the individual, as the professor of a <span class="c1">particular</span> religion, finds himself involved with his own quality of citizenship and with other men as members of the community, may be resolved into the <span class="c1">secular</span> schism between the <span class="c1">political</span> state and <span class="c1">civil</span> society. For man as a <span class="c1">bourgeois</span><a id="footnote-ref69" href="part0057.html#footnote69" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">69</sup></span></a> “life in the state is only an appearance or a fleeting exception to the normal and essential.” It is true that the <span class="c1">bourgeois</span>, like the Jew, participates in political life only in a sophistical way, just as the <span class="c1">citoyen</span><a id="footnote-ref70" href="part0057.html#footnote70" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">70</sup></span></a> is a Jew or a <span class="c1">bourgeois</span> only in a sophistical way. But this sophistry is not personal. It is the <span class="c1">sophistry of the political state </span>itself. The difference between the religious man and the citizen is the same as that between the shopkeeper and the citizens, between the day-labourer and the citizen, between the landed proprietor and the citizen, between the <span class="c1">living individual</span> and the <span class="c1">citizen</span>. The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man, is the same contradiction in which the <span class="c1">bourgeois</span> finds himself with the citizen, and the member of civil society with his <span class="c1">political lion’s skin</span>.</p><p class="s8">This secular opposition, to which the Jewish question reduces itself—the relation between the political state and its presuppositions, whether the latter are material elements such as private property, etc., or spiritual elements such as culture or religion, the conflict between the <span class="c1">general interest</span> and <span class="c1">private interest</span>, the schism between the <span class="c1">political</span> state and <span class="c1">civil society</span>—these profane contradictions, Bauer leaves intact, while he directs his polemic against their <span class="c1">religious</span> expression. “It is precisely this basis—that is, the needs which assure the existence of <span class="c1">civil society</span> and <span class="c1">guarantee its necessity</span>—which exposes its existence to continual danger, maintains an element of uncertainty in civil society, produces this continually changing compound of wealth and poverty, of prosperity and distress, and above all generates change.”<a id="footnote-ref71" href="part0057.html#footnote71" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">71</sup></span></a> Compare the whole section entitled “Civil society,”<a id="footnote-ref72" href="part0057.html#footnote72" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">72</sup></span></a> which follows closely the distinctive features of Hegel’s philosophy of right. Civil society, in its opposition to this political state, is recognized as necessary because the political state is recognized as necessary.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Political</span> emancipation certainly represents a great progress. It is not, indeed, the final form of human emancipation, but it is the final form of human emancipation <span class="c1">within</span> the framework of the prevailing social order. It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real, practical emancipation.</p><p class="s8">Man emancipates himself <span class="c1">politically</span> from religion by expelling it from the sphere of public law to that of private law. Religion is no longer the spirit of the <span class="c1">state</span>, in which man behaves, albeit in a specific and limited way and in a particular sphere, as a species-being, in community with other men. It has become the spirit of <span class="c1">civil society</span>, of the sphere of egoism and of the <span class="c1">bellum omnium contra omnes</span>. It is no longer the essence of <span class="c1">community</span>, but the essence of <span class="c1">differentiation</span>. It has become what it was at the <span class="c1">beginning</span>, an expression of the fact that man is <span class="c1">separated</span> from the <span class="c1">community</span>, from himself and from other men. It is now only the abstract avowal of an individual folly, a private whim or caprice. The infinite fragmentation of religion in North America, for example, already gives it the <span class="c1">external</span> form of a strictly private affair. It has been relegated among the numerous private interests and exiled from the life of the community as such. But one should have no illusions about the scope of political emancipation. The division of man into the <span class="c1">public person</span> and the <span class="c1">private person</span>, the <span class="c1">displacement</span> of religion from the state to civil society—all this is not a stage in political emancipation but its consummation. Thus political emancipation does not abolish, and does not even strive to abolish, man’s <span class="c1">real</span> religiosity.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">decomposition</span> of man into Jew and citizen, Protestant and citizen, religious man and citizen, is not a deception practiced <span class="c1">against</span> the political system nor yet an evasion of political emancipation. It is <span class="c1">political emancipation itself</span>, the <span class="c1">political</span> mode of emancipation from religion. Certainly, in periods when the political state as such comes violently to birth in civil society, and when men strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, the state can, and must, proceed to <span class="c1">abolish and destroy religion</span>; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds to abolish life, by the <span class="c1">guillotine</span>. At those times when the state is most aware of itself, political life seeks to stifle its own prerequisites—civil society and its elements—and to establish itself as the genuine and harmonious species-life of man. But it can only achieve this end by setting itself in <span class="c1">violent </span>contradiction with its own conditions of existence, by declaring a <span class="c1">permanent</span> revolution. Thus the political drama ends necessarily with the restoration of religion, of private property, of all the elements of civil society, just as war ends with the conclusion of peace.</p><p class="s8">In fact, the perfected Christian state is not the so-called <span class="c1">Christian</span> state which acknowledges Christianity as its basis, as the state religion, and thus adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions; it is, rather, the <span class="c1">atheistic</span> state, the democratic state, the state which relegates religion among the other elements of civil society. The state which is still theological, which still professes officially the Christian creed, and which has not yet dared to declare itself a <span class="c1">state</span>, has not yet succeeded in expressing in a human and <span class="c1">secular</span> form, in its political <span class="c1">reality</span>, the human basis of which Christianity is the transcendental expression. The so-called Christian state is simply a <span class="c1">non-state;</span> since it is not Christianity as a religion, but only the <span class="c1">human core</span> of the Christian religion which can realize itself in truly human creations.</p><p class="s8">The so-called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state, but not at all the political realization of Christianity. The state which professes Christianity as a religion does not yet profess it in a political form, because it still has a religious attitude towards religion. In other words, such a state is not the <span class="c1">genuine realization</span> of the human basis of religion, because it still accepts the <span class="c1">unreal,</span> <span class="c1">imaginary</span> form of this human core. The so-called Christian state is an <span class="c1">imperfect</span> state, for which the Christian religion serves as the <span class="c1">supplement</span> and s<span class="c1">anctification</span> of its imperfection. Thus religion becomes necessarily one of its <span class="c1">means;</span> and so it is the <span class="c1">hypocritical</span> state. There is a great difference between saying: (i) that the <span class="c1">perfect</span> state, owing to a deficiency in the general <span class="c1">nature</span> of the state, counts religion as one of its <span class="c1">prerequisites</span>, or (ii) that the <span class="c1">imperfect</span> state, owing to a deficiency in its <span class="c1">particular existence</span> as an imperfect state, declares that religion is its <span class="c1">basis</span>. In the latter, religion becomes <span class="c1">imperfect politics</span>. In the former, the imperfection even of perfected <span class="c1">politics</span> is revealed in religion. The so-called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself <span class="c1">as a state</span>. The democratic state, the real state, does not need religion for its political consummation. On the contrary, it can dispense with religion, because in this case the human core of religion is realized in a profane manner. The so-called Christian state, on the other hand, has a political attitude toward religion, and a religious attitude towards politics. It reduces political institutions and religion equally to mere appearances.</p><p class="s8">In order to make this contradiction clearer we shall examine Bauer’s model of the Christian state, a model which is derived from his study of the German-Christian state.</p><p class="s8">“Quite recently,” says Bauer, “in order to demonstrate the <span class="c1">impossibility</span> or the <span class="c1">non-existence</span> of a Christian state, those passages in the Bible have been frequently quoted with which the state <span class="c1">does not conform and cannot conform unless it wishes to dissolve itself entirely.”</span> </p><p class="s8">“But the question is not so easily settled. What do these Biblical passages demand? Supernatural renunciation, submission to the authority of revelation, turning away from the state, the abolition of profane conditions. But the Christian state proclaims and accomplishes all these things. It has assimilated the <span class="c1">spirit of the Bible</span>, and if it does not reproduce it exactly in the terms which the Bible uses, that is simply because it expresses this spirit in political forms, in forms which are borrowed from the political system of this world but which, in the religious rebirth which they are obliged to undergo, are reduced to simple appearances. Man turns away from the state and by this means realizes and completes the political institutions.”<a id="footnote-ref73" href="part0057.html#footnote73" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">73</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Bauer continues by showing that the members of a Christian state no longer constitute a nation with a will of its own. The nation has its true existence in the leader to whom it is subjected, but this leader is, by his origin and nature, alien to it since he has been imposed by God without the people having any part in the matter. The laws of such a nation are not its own work, but are direct revelations. The supreme leader, in his relations with the real nation, the masses, requires privileged intermediaries; and the nation itself disintegrates into a multitude of distinct spheres which are formed and determined by chance, are differentiated from each other by their interests and their specific passions and prejudices, and acquire as a privilege the permission to isolate themselves from each other, etc.<a id="footnote-ref74" href="part0057.html#footnote74" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">74</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">But Bauer himself says: “Politics, if it is to be nothing more than religion, should not be politics; any more than the scouring of pans, if it is treated as a religious matter, should be regarded as ordinary housekeeping.”<a id="footnote-ref75" href="part0057.html#footnote75" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">75</sup></span></a> But in the German-Christian state religion is an “economic matter” just as “economic matters” are religion. In the German-Christian state the power of religion is the religion of power.</p><p class="s8">The separation of the “spirit of the Bible” from the “letter of the Bible” is an <span class="c1">irreligious</span> act. The state which expresses the Bible in the letter of politics, or in any letter other than that of the Holy Ghost, commits sacrilege, if note in the eyes of men at least in the eyes of its own religion. The state which acknowledges the Bible as its charter and Christianity as its supreme rule must be assessed according to the words of the Bible; for even the language of the Bible is sacred. Such a State, as well as the <span class="c1">human rubbish</span> upon which it is based, finds itself involved in a painful contradiction, which is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness, when it is referred to those words of the Bible “with which it does not conform and <span class="c1">cannot conform unless it wishes to dissolve itself entirely</span>.” And why does it not wish to dissolve itself entirely? The state itself cannot answer either itself or others. In its own consciousness the official Christian state is an “ought” whose realization is impossible. It cannot affirm the reality of its own existence without lying to itself, and so it remains always in its own eyes an object of doubt, an uncertain and problematic object. Criticism is, therefore, entirely within its rights in forcing the state, which supports itself upon the Bible, into a total disorder of thought in which it no longer knows whether it is <span class="c1">illusion</span> or <span class="c1">reality;</span> and in which the infamy of its <span class="c1">profane</span> ends (for which religion serves as a cloak) enter into an insoluble conflict with the probity of its <span class="c1">religious</span> consciousness (for which religion appears as the goal of the world). Such a state can only escape its inner torment by becoming the <span class="c1">myrmidon</span> of the Catholic Church. In the face of this Church, which asserts that secular power is entirely subordinate to it commands, the state is powerless; powerless the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit.</p><p class="s8">What prevails in the so-called Christian state is not man but alienation. The only man who counts—the <span class="c1">King</span>—is specifically differentiated from other men and is still a religious being associated directly with heaven and with God. The relations which exist here are relations still based upon <span class="c1">faith</span>. The religious spirit is still not really secularized.</p><p class="s8">But the religious spirit cannot be <span class="c1">really</span> secularized. For what is it but the <span class="c1">non-secular</span> form of a stage in the development of the human spirit? The religious spirit can only be realized if the stage of development of the human spirit which it expresses in religious form, manifests and constitutes itself in its <span class="c1">secular</span> form. This is what happens in the <span class="c1">democratic</span> state. The basis of this state is not Christianity but the <span class="c1">human basis</span> of Christianity. Religion remains the ideal, non-secular consciousness of its members, because it is the ideal form of the <span class="c1">stage of human development</span> which has been attained. </p><p class="s8">The members of the political state are religious because of the dualism between individual life and species-life, between the life of civil society and political life. They are religious in the sense that man treats political life, which is remote from his own individual existence, as if it were his true life; and in the sense that religion is here the spirit of civil society, and expresses the separation and withdrawal of man from man. Political democracy is Christian in the sense that man, not merely one man but every man, is there considered a sovereign being, a supreme being; but it is uneducated, unsocial man, man just as he is in his fortuitous existence, man as he has been corrupted, lost to himself, alienated, subjected to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements, by the whole organization of our society—in short man who is not yet a <span class="c1">real</span> species-being. Creations of fantasy, dreams, the postulates of Christianity, the sovereignty of man—but of man as an alien being distinguished from the real man—all these become, in democracy, the tangible and present reality, secular maxims.</p><p class="s8">In the perfected democracy, the religious and theological consciousness appears to itself all the more religious and theological in that it is apparently without any political significance or terrestrial aims, is an affair of the heart withdrawn from the world, an expression of the limitations of reason, a product of arbitrariness and fantasy, a veritable life in the beyond. Christianity here attains the <span class="c1">practical</span> expression of its universal religious significance, because the most varied views are brought together in the form of Christianity, and still more because Christianity does not ask that anyone should profess Christianity, but simply that he should have some kind of religion (<span class="c1">see</span> Beaumont, op. cit.). The religious consciousness runs riot in a wealth of contradictions and diversity.</p><p class="s8">We have shown, therefore, that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence, although this is no longer a privileged religion. The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself in relation to his citizenship is only <span class="c1">one aspect</span> of the universal secular <span class="c1">contradiction between the political state and</span> civil society. The consummation of the Christian state is a state which acknowledges itself simply as a state and ignores the religion of its members. The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion. </p><p class="s8">We do not say to the Jews, therefore, as does Bauer: you cannot be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves completely from Judaism. We say rather: it is because you can be emancipated politically, without renouncing Judaism completely and absolutely, that <span class="c1">political emancipation</span> itself is not <span class="c1">human</span> emancipation. If you want to be politically emancipated, without emancipating yourselves humanly, the inadequacy and the contradiction is not entirely in yourselves but in the nature and the category of political emancipation. If you are preoccupied with this category you share the general prejudice. Just as the state <span class="c1">evangelizes</span> when, although it is a state, it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews, the Jew <span class="c1">acts politically</span> when, though a Jew, he demands civil rights.</p><p class="s8">But if a man, though a Jew, can be emancipated politically and acquire civil rights, can he claim and acquire what are called the <span class="c1">rights of man?</span> Bauer <span class="c1">denies</span> it. “The question is whether the Jew as such, that is, the Jew who himself avows that he is constrained by his true nature to live eternally separate from men, is able to acquire and to concede to others the <span class="c1">universal rights of man</span>.”</p><p class="s8">“The idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the Christian world, in the last century. It is not an innate idea; on the contrary, it is acquired in a struggle against the historical traditions in which man has been educated up to the present time. The rights of man are not, therefore, a gift of nature, nor a legacy from past history, but the reward of a struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which history has hitherto transmitted from generation to generation. They are the results of culture, and only he can possess them who has merited and earned them.”</p><p class="s8">“But can the Jew really take possession of them? As long as he remains Jewish the limited nature which makes him a Jew must prevail over the human nature which should associate him, as a man, with other men; and it will isolate him from everyone who is not a Jew. He declares, by this separation, that the particular nature which makes him Jewish is his true and supreme nature, before which human nature has to efface itself.”</p><p class="s8">“Similarly, the Christian as such cannot grant the rights of man.”<a id="footnote-ref76" href="part0057.html#footnote76" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">76</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">According to Bauer man has to sacrifice the <span class="c1">“privilege of faith”</span> in order to acquire the general rights of man. Let us consider for a moment the so-called rights of man; let us examine them in their most authentic form, that which they have among those who <span class="c1">discovered</span> them, the North Americans and the French! These rights of man are, in part, <span class="c1">political rights</span>, which can only be exercised if one is a member of a community. Their content is <span class="c1">participation</span> in the <span class="c1">community </span>life, in the <span class="c1">political </span>life of the community, the life of the state. They fall in the category of <span class="c1">political liberty</span>, <span class="c1">of civil rights,</span> which as we have seen do not at all presuppose the consistent and positive abolition of religion; nor consequently, of Judaism. It remains to consider the other part, namely the <span class="c1">rights of man</span> as distinct from the <span class="c1">rights of the citizen.</span> </p><p class="s8">Among them is to be found the freedom of conscience, the right to practise a chosen religion. The <span class="c1">privilege of faith</span> is expressly recognized, either as a <span class="c1">right of man</span> or as a consequence of a right of man, namely liberty. <span class="c1">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</span>, 1791, Article 10: “No one is to be disturbed on account of his opinions, even religious opinions.” There is guaranteed, as one of the rights of man, “the liberty of every man to practise the <span class="c1">religion</span> to which he adheres.”</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">The Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc.</span> 1793, enumerates among the rights of man (Article 7): “The liberty of religious observance.” Moreover, it is even stated, with respect to the right to express ideas and opinions, to hold meetings, to practise a religion, that: “The necessity of enunciating these <span class="c1">rights</span> presupposes either the existence or the recent memory of despotism.” Compare the Constitution of 1795, Section XII, Article 354.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Constitution of Pennsylvania</span>, Article 9, § 3: “All men have received from nature the imprescriptible <span class="c1">right</span> to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience, and no one can be legally compelled to follow, establish or support against his will any religion or religious ministry. No human authority can, in any circumstances, intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul.”</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Constitution of New Hampshire</span>, Articles 5 and 6: “Among these natural rights some are by nature inalienable since nothing can replace them. The rights of conscience are among them.”<a id="footnote-ref77" href="part0057.html#footnote77" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">77</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">The incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is so little manifest in the concept of the rights of man that the <span class="c1">right to be religious</span>, in one’s own fashion, and to practise one’s own particular religion, is expressly included among the rights of man. The privilege of faith is a <span class="c1">universal right of man</span>.</p><p class="s8">A distinction is made between the rights of man and the rights of the citizen. Who is this <span class="c1">man</span> distinct from the <span class="c1">citizen?</span> No one but the <span class="c1">member of civil society</span>. Why is the member of civil society called “man,” simply man, and why are his rights called the “rights of man”? How is this fact to be explained? By the relation between the political state and civil society, and by the nature of political emancipation.</p><p class="s8">Let us notice first of all that the so-called <span class="c1">rights of man</span>, as distinct from the <span class="c1">rights of the citizen</span>, are simply the rights of a <span class="c1">member of civil society</span>, that is, of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. The most radical constitution, that of 1793, says: <span class="c1">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen:</span> Article 2. “These rights, etc. (the natural and imprescriptible rights) are: <span class="c1">equality, liberty, security, property.</span></p><p class="s8">What constitutes liberty?</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Article 6.</span> “Liberty is the power which man has to do everything which does not harm the rights of others.”</p><p class="s8">Liberty is, therefore, the right to do everything which does not harm others. The limits within which each individual can act without harming others are determined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is marked by a stake. It is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated monad, withdrawn into himself. Why, according to Bauer, is the Jew not fitted to acquire the rights of man? “As long as he remains Jewish the limited nature which makes him a Jew must prevail over the human nature which should associate him, as a man, with other men; and it will isolate him from everyone who is not a Jew.” But liberty as a right of man is not founded upon the relations between man and man, but rather upon the separation of man from man. It is the right of such separation. The right of the <span class="c1">circumscribed</span> individual, withdrawn into himself.</p><p class="s8">The practical application of the right of liberty is the right of private property. What constitutes the right of private property?</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Article 16 (Constitution </span>of 1793)<span class="c1">.</span> “The right of <span class="c1">property</span> is that which belongs to every citizen of enjoying and disposing <span class="c1">as he will</span> of his goods and revenues, of the fruits of his work and industry.”</p><p class="s8">The right of property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one’s fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society. It is the right of self-interest. This individual liberty, and its application, form the basis of civil society. It leads every man to see in other men, not the <span class="c1">realization</span>, but rather the <span class="c1">limitation</span> of his own liberty. It declares above all the right “to enjoy and to dispose <span class="c1">as one will</span>, one’s goods and revenues, the fruits of one’s work and industry.”</p><p class="s8">There remain the other rights of man, equality and security.</p><p class="s8">The term “equality” has here no political significance. It is only the equal right to liberty as defined above; namely that every man is equally regarded as a self-sufficient monad. The Constitution of 1795 defines the concept of liberty in this sense.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Article 5 (Constitution </span>of 1795)<span class="c1">.</span> “Equality consists in the fact that the law is the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.” </p><p class="s8">And security?</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Article 8 (Constitution </span>of 1793). “Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property.”</p><p class="s8">Security is the supreme social concept of civil society; the concept of the police. The whole society exists only in order to guarantee for each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property. It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society “the state of need and of reason.” </p><p class="s8">The concept of security is not enough to raise civil society above its egoism. Security is, rather, the <span class="c1">assurance</span> of its egoism.</p><p class="s8">None of the supposed rights of man, therefore, go beyond the egoistic man, man as he is, as a member of civil society; that is, an individual separated from the community, withdrawn into himself, wholly preoccupied with his private interest and acting in accordance with his private caprice. Man is far from being considered, in the rights of man, as a species-being; on the contrary, species-life itself—society—appears as a system which is external to the individual and as a limitation of his original independence. The only bond between men is natural necessity, need and private interest, the preservation of their property and their egoistic persons.</p><p class="s8">It is difficult enough to understand that a nation which has just begun to liberate itself, to tear down all the barriers between different sections of the people and to establish a political community, should solemnly proclaim (<span class="c1">Declaration</span> of 1791) the rights of the egoistic man, separated from his fellow men and from the community, and should renew this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation (and is, therefore, urgently called for), and when the sacrifice of all the interests of civil society is in question and egoism should be punished as a crime. (<span class="c1">Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc.</span> 1793). The matter becomes still more incomprehensible when we observe that the political liberators reduce citizenship, the <span class="c1">political community</span>, to a mere <span class="c1">means</span> for preserving these so-called rights of man; and consequently, that the citizen is declared to be the servant of egoistic “man,” that the sphere in which man functions as a species-being is degraded to a level below the sphere where he functions as a partial being, and finally that it is man as a bourgeois and not man as a citizen who is considered the <span class="c1">true</span> and <span class="c1">authentic</span> man.</p><p class="s8">“The end of every <span class="c1">political association</span> is the <span class="c1">preservation</span> of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.” (<span class="c1">Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc.</span> 1791, Article 2.) “Government is instituted in order to guarantee man’s enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights.” (<span class="c1">Declaration, etc.</span> 1793, Article 1.) Thus, even in the period of its youthful enthusiasm, which is raised to fever pitch by the force of circumstances, political life declares itself to be only a <span class="c1">means</span>, whose end is the life of civil society. It is true that its revolutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory. While, for instance, security is declared to be one of the rights of man, the violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly considered. While the “unlimited freedom of the Press” (<span class="c1">Constitution</span> of 1793, Article 122), as a corollary of the right of individual liberty, is guaranteed, the freedom of the Press is completely destroyed, since “the freedom of the Press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty.”<a id="footnote-ref78" href="part0057.html#footnote78" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">78</sup></span></a> This amounts to saying: the right to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with <span class="c1">political</span> life, whereas in theory political life is no more than the guarantee of the rights of man—the rights of the individual man—and should, therefore, be suspended as soon as it comes into contradiction with its <span class="c1">end</span>, these rights of man. But practice is only the exception, while theory is the rule. Even if one decided to regard revolutionary practice as the correct expression of this relation, the problem would remain as to why it is that in the minds of political liberators the relation is inverted, so that the end appears as the means and the means as the end? This optical illusion of their consciousness would always remain a problem, though a psychological and theoretical one.</p><p class="s8">But the problem is easily solved.</p><p class="s8">Political emancipation is at the same time the <span class="c1">dissolution</span> of the old society, upon which the sovereign power, the alienated political life of the people, rests. Political revolution is a revolution of civil society. What was the nature of the old society? It can be characterized in one word: <span class="c1">feudalism</span>. The old civil society had a <span class="c1">directly political</span> character; that is, the elements of civil life such as property, the family, and types of occupation had been raised, in the form of lordship, caste and guilds, to elements of political life. They determined, in this form, the relation of the individual to the <span class="c1">state as a whole;</span> that is, his <span class="c1">political</span> situation, or in other words, his separation and exclusion from the other elements of society. For this organization of national life did not constitute property and labour as social element; it rather succeeded in <span class="c1">separating</span> them from the body of the state, and made them <span class="c1">distinct</span> societies within society. Nevertheless, at least in the feudal sense, the vital functions and conditions of civil society remained political. They excluded the individual from the body of the state, and transformed the <span class="c1">particular</span> relation which existed between his corporation and the state into a general relation between the individual and social life, just as they transformed his specific civil activity and situation into a general activity and situation. As a result of this organization, the state as a whole and its consciousness, will and activity—the general political power—also necessarily appeared as the <span class="c1">private</span> affair of a ruler and is servants, separated from the people.</p><p class="s8">The political revolution which overthrew this power of the ruler, which made state affairs the affairs of the people, and the political state a matter of <span class="c1">general</span> concern, i.e. a real state, necessarily shattered everything—estates, corporations, guilds, privileges—which expressed the separation of the people from community life. The political revolution therefore <span class="c1">abolished</span> the <span class="c1">political character of civil society</span>. It dissolved civil society into its basic elements, on the one hand <span class="c1">individuals</span>, and on the other hand the <span class="c1">material and cultural elements</span> which formed the life experience and the civil situation of these individuals. It set free the political spirit which had, so to speak, been dissolved, fragmented and lost in the various culs-de-sac of feudal society; it reassembled these scattered fragments, liberated the political spirit from its connexion with civil life and made of it the community sphere, the <span class="c1">general</span> concern of the people, in principle independent of these particular elements of civil life. A <span class="c1">specific</span> activity and situation in life no longer had any but an individual significance. They no longer constituted the general relation between the individual and the state as a whole. Public affairs as such became the general affair of each individual, and political functions became general functions.</p><p class="s8">But the consummation of the idealism of the state was at the same time the consummation of the materialism of civil society. The bonds which had restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society were removed along with the political yoke. Political emancipation was at the same time an emancipation of civil society from politics and from even the <span class="c1">semblance</span> of a general content.</p><p class="s8">Feudal society was dissolved into its basic element, <span class="c1">man;</span> but into <span class="c1">egoistic</span> man who was its real foundation.</p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Man</span> in this aspect, the member of civil society, is now the foundation and presupposition of the <span class="c1">political</span> state. He is recognized as such in the rights of man. </p><p class="s8">But the liberty of egoistic man, and the recognition of this liberty, is rather the recognition of the <span class="c1">frenzied</span> movement of the cultural and material elements which form the content of his life.</p><p class="s8">Thus man was not liberated from religion; he received religious liberty. He was not liberated from property; he received the liberty to own property. He was not liberated from the egoism of business; he received the liberty to engage in business.</p><p class="s8">The <span class="c1">formation of the political state,</span> and the dissolution of civil society into independent <span class="c1">individuals</span> whose relations are regulated by <span class="c1">law</span>, as the relations between men in the corporations and guilds were regulated by <span class="c1">privilege</span>, are accomplished by <span class="c1">one and the same act.</span> Man as a member of civil society—<span class="c1">non-political</span> man—necessarily appears as the <span class="c1">natural</span> man. The rights of man appear as natural rights because <span class="c1">conscious</span> activity is concentrated upon political <span class="c1">action</span>. <span class="c1">Egoistic</span> man is the <span class="c1">passive</span>, <span class="c1">given</span> result of the dissolution of society, an object of <span class="c1">direct apprehension</span> and consequently a <span class="c1">natural</span> object. The <span class="c1">political revolution</span> dissolves civil society into its elements without <span class="c1">revolutionizing</span> these elements themselves or subjecting them to criticism. This revolution regards civil society, the sphere of human needs, labour, private interests and civil law, as the <span class="c1">basis of its own existence</span>, as a self-subsistent <span class="c1">precondition</span>, and thus as its <span class="c1">natural basis</span>. Finally, man as a member of civil society is identified with <span class="c1">authentic man</span>, man as distinct from citizen, because he is man in his sensuous, individual and <span class="c1">immediate</span> existence, whereas <span class="c1">political</span> man is only abstract, artificial man, man as an <span class="c1">allegorical, moral</span> person. Thus man as he really is, is seen only in the form of <span class="c1">egoistic</span> man, and man in his <span class="c1">true</span> nature only in the form of the <span class="c1">abstract citizen</span>.</p><p class="s8">The abstract notion of political man is well formulated by Rousseau: “Whoever dares undertake to establish a people’s institutions must feel himself capable of <span class="c1">changing</span>, as it were, <span class="c1">human nature</span> itself, of <span class="c1">transforming </span>each individual who, in isolation, is a complete but solitary whole, into a <span class="c1">part</span> of something greater than himself, from which in a sense, he derives his life and his being; [of changing man’s nature in order to strengthen it;] of substituting a limited and moral existence for the physical and independent life [with which all of us are endowed by nature]. His task, in short, is to take from a <span class="c1">man his own powers</span>, and to give him in exchange alien powers which he can only employ with the help of other men.”<a id="footnote-ref79" href="part0057.html#footnote79" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">79</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">Every emancipation is a <span class="c1">restoration </span>of the human world and of human relationships to <span class="c1">man himself</span>.</p><p class="s8">Political emancipation is a reduction of man, on the one hand to a member of civil society, an <span class="c1">independent</span> and <span class="c1">egoistic</span> individual, and on the other hand, to a <span class="c1">citizen,</span> to a moral person.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">Human emancipation will only be complete when the real, individual man has absorbed into himself the abstract citizen; when as an individual man, in his everyday life, in his work, and in his relationships, he has become a <span class="c1">species-being;</span> and when he has recognized and organized his own powers (<span class="c1">forces propres</span>) as <span class="c1">social </span>powers so that he no longer separates this social power from himself as <span class="c1">political</span> power.</p>
