Morgan propounded a matrilineal theory of the origins of human society. His account of a stateless primitive society founded on communal property appeared to Marx and Engels to have (as Engels later put it) the same significance for the history of primitive society as Darwin’s theory of evolution had for biology and Marx’s theory of surplus value had for political economy. Marx planned to write a study based on Morgan’s researches, and made extensive extracts from and notes on <span class="c1">Ancient Society</span> for this purpose.<a id="footnote-ref442" href="part0057.html#footnote442" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">442</sup></span></a> Using Marx’s materials as well as the original sources, and occasionally even interpolating Marx’s marginalia, Engels in 1884 wrote his monograph on <span class="c1">The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</span>, from which this selection is taken. The two subtitles have been added by the editor of this reader.</p>
