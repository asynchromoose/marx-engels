Engels attempted to make good this deficiency with the sketch of the conception presented in <span class="c1">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</span>, and by offering clarifications on important particular points in these letters. Of special note are his discussions of ideology and his effort to guard against an oversimplified interpretation of the doctrine of economic determinism in history.</p>
