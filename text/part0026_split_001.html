<p class="s33">Ricardo’s Denial of General Over-Production.</p><p class="s33">Possibility of a Crisis Inherent in the Inner</p><p class="s33">Contradictions of Commodity and Money</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">So far as crises are concerned, all those writers who describe the real movement of prices, or all experts, who write in the actual situation of a crisis, have been right in ignoring the allegedly theoretical twaddle and in contenting themselves with the idea that what may be true in abstract theory—namely, that no gluts of the market and so forth are possible—is, nevertheless, wrong in practice. The constant recurrence of crises has in fact reduced the rigmarole of Say and others to a phraseology which is now only used in times of prosperity but is cast aside in times of crises.</p><p class="s8">In the crises of the world market, the contradictions and antagonisms of bourgeois production are strikingly revealed. Instead of investigating the nature of the conflicting elements which erupt in the catastrophe, the apologists content themselves with denying the catastrophe itself and insisting, in the face of their regular and periodic recurrence, that if production were carried on according to the textbooks, crises would never occur. Thus the apologetics consist in the falsification of the simplest economic relations, and particularly in clinging to the concept of unity in the face of contradiction.</p><p class="s8">If, for example, purchase and sale—or the metamorphosis of commodities—represent the unity of two processes, or rather the movement of one process through two opposite phases, and thus essentially the unity of the two phases, the movement is essentially just as much the separation of these two phases and their becoming independent of each other. Since, however, they belong together, the independence of the two correlated aspects can only <span class="c1">show itself</span> forcibly, as a destructive process. It is just the <span class="c1">crises</span> in which they assert their unity, the unity of the different aspects. The independence which these two linked and complementary phases assume in relation to each other is forcibly destroyed. Thus the crisis manifests the unity of the two phases that have become independent of each other. There would be no crisis without this inner unity of factors that are apparently indifferent to each other. But no, says the apologetic economist. Because there is this unity, there can be <span class="c1">no</span> crises. Which in turn means nothing but that the unity of contradictory factors excludes contradiction.</p><p class="s8">In order to prove that capitalist production cannot lead to general crises, all its conditions and distinct forms, all its principles and specific features—in short <span class="c1">capitalist production</span> itself—are denied. In fact it is demonstrated that if the capitalist mode of production had not developed in a specific way and become a unique form of social production, but were a mode of production dating back to the most rudimentary stages, then its peculiar contradictions and conflicts and hence also their eruption in crises would not exist.</p><p class="s8">Following Say, Ricardo writes: “Productions are always bought by productions, or by services; money is only the medium by which the exchange is effected” (341). Here, therefore, firstly <span class="c1">commodity</span>, in which the contradiction between exchange-value and use-value exists, becomes mere product (use-value) and therefore the exchange of commodities is transformed into mere barter of products, of simple use-values. This is a return not only to the time before capitalist production, but even to the time before there was simple commodity production; and the most complicated phenomenon of capitalist production—the world market crises—is flatly denied, by denying the first condition of capitalist production, namely, that the product must be a commodity and therefore express itself as money and undergo the process of metamorphosis. Instead of speaking of wage-labour, the term “services” is used. This word again omits the specific characteristic of wage-labour and of its use—namely, that it increases the value of the commodities against which it is exchanged, that it creates surplus-value—and in doing so, it disregards the specific relationship through which money and commodities are transformed into capital. <span class="c1">“Service”</span> is labour seen only as <span class="c1">use-value</span> (which is a side issue in capitalist production) just as the term “productions” fails to express the essence of commodity and its inherent contradiction. It is quite consistent that <span class="c1">money </span>is then regarded merely as an intermediary in the exchange of products, and not as an essential and necessary form of existence of the commodity which must manifest itself as exchange-value, as general social labour. Since the transformation of the commodity into mere use-value (product) obliterates the essence of exchange-value, it is just as easy to deny, or rather it is necessary to deny, that <span class="c1">money</span> is an essential aspect of the commodity and that in the process of metamorphosis it is <span class="c1">independent</span> of the original form of the commodity.</p><p class="s8">Crises are thus reasoned out of existence here by forgetting or denying the first elements of capitalist production: the existence of the product as a commodity, the duplication of the commodity in commodity and money, the consequent separation which takes place in the exchange of commodities and finally the relation of money or commodities to wage-labour. </p><p class="s8">Incidentally, those economists are no better, who (like John Stuart Mill) want to explain the crises by these simple <span class="c1">possibilities</span> of crisis contained in the metamorphosis of commodities—such as the separation between purchase and sale. These factors which explain the possibility of crises, by no means explain their actual occurrence. They do not explain <span class="c1">why</span> the phases of the process come into such conflict that their inner unity can only assert itself through a crisis, through a violent process. This <span class="c1">separation</span> appears in the crisis; it is the elementary form of the crisis. To <span class="c1">explain</span> the crisis on the basis of this, its elementary form, is to explain the existence of the crisis by describing its most abstract form, that is to say, to explain the crisis by the crisis. Ricardo says:</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s21">No man produces, but with a view to consume <span class="c1">or sell</span>, and he never sells, but with an intention to <span class="c1">purchase</span> some other commodity, which may be immediately useful to him, or which may contribute to <span class="c1">future production</span>. By producing, then, he necessarily becomes either the consumer of his own goods, or the purchaser and consumer of the goods of some person. It is not to be supposed that he should, <span class="c1">for any length of time</span>, be ill-informed of the commodities which he can most advantageously produce, to attain the object which he has in view, namely, the <span class="c1">possession of other goods;</span> and, <span class="c1">therefore</span>, it is not probable that he will <span class="c1">continually</span> produce a commodity for which there is no demand. [Pp. 339–40.]</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">This is the childish babble of a Say, but it is not worthy of Ricardo. In the first place, no capitalist produces in order to consume his product. And when speaking of capitalist production, it is right to say that: “no man produces with a view to consume his own product,” even if he uses portions of his product for industrial consumption. But here the point in question is private consumption. Previously it was forgotten that the product is a commodity. Now even the social division of labour is forgotten. In a situation where men produce for themselves, there are indeed no crises, but neither is there capitalist production. Nor have we ever heard that the ancients, with their slave production ever knew crises, although individual producers among the ancients too, did go bankrupt. The first part of the alternative is nonsense. The second as well. A man who has produced does not have the choice of selling or not selling. He must <span class="c1">sell.</span> In the crisis there arises the very situation in which he cannot sell or can only sell below the cost-price or must even sell at a positive loss. What difference does it make, therefore, to him or to us that he has produced in order to sell? The very question we want to solve is what has thwarted this good intention of his?</p><p class="s8">Further: he “never <span class="c1">sells</span>, but with an intention to <span class="c1">purchase</span> some other commodity, which may be immediately useful to him, or which may contribute to future production” (p. 339).</p><p class="s8">What a cosy description of bourgeois conditions! Ricardo even forgets that a person may <span class="c1">sell</span> in order to <span class="c1">pay</span>, and that these forced sales play a very significant role in the crises. The capitalist’s immediate object in selling, is to turn his commodity, or rather his commodity capital, back into <span class="c1">money capital</span>, and thereby to <span class="c1">realise</span> his profit. Consumption—revenue—is by no means the guiding motive in this process, although it is for the person who only sells <span class="c1">commodities</span> in order to transform them into means of subsistence. But this is not capitalist production, in which revenue appears as the result and not as the determining purpose. Everyone <span class="c1">sells</span> first of all in order to sell, that is to say, in order to transform commodities into money.</p><p class="s8">During the crisis, a man may be very pleased, if he has <span class="c1">sold</span> his commodities without immediately thinking of a purchase. On the other hand, if the value that has been realised is again to be used as capital, it must go through the process of reproduction, that is, it must be exchanged for labour and commodities. But the crisis is precisely the phase of disturbance and interruption of the process of reproduction. And this disturbance cannot be explained by the fact that it does not occur in those times when there is no crisis. There is no doubt that no one “will continually produce a commodity for which there is no demand” (p. 340), but no one is talking about such an absurd hypothesis. Nor has it anything to do with the problem. The immediate purpose of capitalist production is not “the possession of other goods,” but the appropriation of value, of money, of abstract wealth.</p><p class="s8">Ricardo’s statements here are also based on James Mill’s proposition on the “metaphysical equilibrium of purchases and sales,” which I examined previously—an equilibrium which sees<span class="c1"> only</span> the unity, but not the separation in the processes of purchase and sale. Hence also Ricardo’s assertion (following James Mill): “Too much of a <span class="c1">particular</span> commodity may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it; but this cannot be the case with respect to <span class="c1">all</span> commodities. (pp. 341–42).</p><p class="s8">Money is not only “the medium by which the exchange is effected” (p. 341), but at the same time the medium by which the exchange of product with product is divided into two acts, which are independent of each other, and separate in time and space. With Ricardo, however, this false conception of money is due to the fact that he concentrates exclusively on the <span class="c1">quantitative determination</span> of exchange-value, namely, that it is equal to a definite quantity of labour-time, forgetting on the other hand the <span class="c1">qualitative</span> characteristic, that individual labour must present itself as <span class="c1">abstract, general social</span> labour only through its alienation.<a id="footnote-ref295" href="part0057.html#footnote295" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">295</sup></span></a></p><p class="s8">That only <span class="c1">particular</span> commodities, and not <span class="c1">all</span> kinds of commodities, can form “a glut in the market” and that therefore over-production can always only be partial, is a poor way out. In the first place, if we consider only the nature of the commodity, there is nothing to prevent <span class="c1">all commodities</span> from being super-abundant on the market, and therefore all falling below their price. We are here only concerned with the factor of crisis. That is all commodities, apart from money [may be super-abundant]. [The proposition] <span class="c1">the</span> commodity must be converted into money, only means that: <span class="c1">all</span> commodities must do so. And just as the difficulty of undergoing this metamorphosis exists for an individual commodity, so it can exist for all commodities. The general nature of the metamorphosis of commodities—which includes the separation of purchase and sale just as it does their unity—instead of excluding the <span class="c1">possibility</span> of a general glut, on the contrary, contains the possibility of a general glut.</p><p class="s8">Ricardo’s and similar types of reasoning are moreover based not only on the relation of <span class="c1">purchase and sale</span>, but also on that of <span class="c1">demand and supply</span>, which we have to examine only when considering the competition of capitals. As Mill says, purchase is sale etc., therefore demand is supply and supply demand. But they also fall apart and can become independent of each other. At a given moment, the supply of all commodities can be greater than the demand for all commodities, since the demand for the <span class="c1">general commodity</span>, money, exchange-value, is greater than the demand for all particular commodities, in other words the motive to turn the commodity into money, to realise its exchange-value, prevails over the motive to transform the commodity again into use-value.</p><p class="s8">If relation of demand and supply is taken in a wider and more concrete sense, then it comprises the relation of <span class="c1">production</span> and <span class="c1">consumption</span> as well. Here again the <span class="c1">unity</span> of these two phases, which does exist and which forcibly asserts itself during the crisis, must be seen as opposed to the <span class="c1">separation </span>and <span class="c1">antagonism</span> of these two phases, separation and antagonism which exist just as much, and are moreover typical of bourgeois production.</p><p class="s8">With regard to the contradiction between partial and universal over-production, in so far as the existence of the former is affirmed in order to evade the latter, the following observation may be made: </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Firstly:</span> Crises are usually preceded by a general inflation in prices of all articles of capitalist production. All of them therefore participate in the subsequent crash and at their former prices they cause a glut in the market. The market can absorb a larger volume of commodities at falling prices, at prices which have fallen below their cost-prices, than it could absorb at their former prices. The excess of commodities is always relative; in other words it is an excess at particular prices. The prices at which the commodities are then absorbed are ruinous for the producer or merchant.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2"><span class="c1">Secondly:</span> For a crisis (and therefore also for over-production) to be general, it suffices for it to affect the principal commercial goods.</p>
