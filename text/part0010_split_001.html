Family and civil society are the premises of the state; they are the genuinely active elements, but in speculative philosophy things are inverted. When the idea is made the subject, however, the real subjects, namely, civil society, family, “circumstances, caprice, etc.,” become <span class="c1">unreal</span> objective elements of the idea with a changed significance.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8"><span class="c1">Rationally interpreted</span>, Hegel’s propositions would mean only this: The family and civil society are parts of the state. The material of the state is distributed amongst them “by circumstances, caprice and the individual’s own choice of vocation.” The citizens of the state are members of families and members of civil society.</p><p class="s8">“The actual idea, mind, <span class="c1">divides itself</span> into the two ideal spheres of its concept, family and civil society, that is, <span class="c1">its finite</span> phase”—hence, the division of the state into family and civil society is ideal, i.e., necessary as part of the essence of the state. Family and civil society are actual components of the state, actual spiritual existences of the will; they are modes of existence of the state. Family and civil society constitute <span class="c1">themselves</span> as the state. They are the driving force. According to Hegel, they are, on the contrary, <span class="c1">produced</span> by the actual idea. It is not the course of their own life which unites them in the state; on the contrary, it is the idea which in the course of its life has separated them off from itself. Indeed, they are the finiteness of this idea. They owe their presence to another mind than their own. They are entities determined by a third party, not self-determined entities. Accordingly, they are also defined as “finiteness,” as the “actual idea’s” own <span class="c1">finiteness</span>. The purpose of their being is not this being itself; rather, the idea separates these presuppositions off from itself “so as to emerge from their ideality as explicitly infinite actual mind.” That is to say, there can be no political state without the natural basis of the family and the artificial basis of civil society; they are for it a <span class="c1">conditio sine qua non</span>. But the condition is postulated as the conditioned, the determinant as the determined, the producing factor as the product of its product. The actual idea only degrades itself into the “finiteness” of the family and civil society so as by transcending them to enjoy and bring forth its infinity. “<span class="c1">Accordingly</span>” (in order to achieve its purpose), it “assigns to these spheres the material of this, its finite actuality” (this? which? these spheres are indeed its “finite actuality,” its “material”), “individuals as a multitude” (“the individuals, the multitude” are here the material of the state; “the state consists of them”; this composition of the state is here expressed as an act of the idea, as an “allocation” which it undertakes with its own material. The fact is that the state issues from the multitude in their existence as members of families and as members of civil society. Speculative philosophy expresses this fact as the idea’s deed, not as the idea of the multitude, but as the deed of a subjective idea different from the fact itself), “in such a way that with regard to the individual this assignment” (previously the discussion was only about the assignment of individuals to the spheres of the family and civil society) “appears mediated by circumstances, caprice, etc.” Empirical actuality is thus accepted as it is. It is also expressed as rational, but it is not rational on account of its own reason, but because the empirical fact in its empirical existence has a different significance from it itself. The fact which is taken as a point of departure is not conceived as such, but as a mystical result. The actual becomes a phenomenon, but the idea has no other content than this phenomenon. Nor has the idea any other purpose than the logical one of being “explicitly infinite actual mind.” The entire mystery of the philosophy of law and of Hegel’s philosophy as a whole is set out in this paragraph.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s20">* * *</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">If Hegel had set out from real subjects as the bases of the state he would not have found it necessary to transform the state in a mystical fashion into a subject. “In its truth, however,” says Hegel, “subjectivity exists only as <span class="c1">subject</span>, personality only as <span class="c1">person</span>.” This too is a piece of mystification. Subjectivity is a characteristic of the subject, personality a characteristic of the person. Instead of conceiving them as predicates of their subjects. Hegel gives the predicates an independent existence and subsequently transforms them in a mystical fashion into their subjects.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_2">The existence of predicates is the subject, so that the subject is the existence of subjectivity, etc., Hegel transforms the predicates, the objects, into independent entities, but divorced from their actual independence, their subject. Subsequently the actual subject appears as a result, whereas one must start from the actual subject and look at its objectification. The mystical substance, therefore, becomes the actual subject, and the real subject appears as something else, as an element of the mystical substance. Precisely because Hegel starts from the predicates of the general description instead of from the real <span class="c1">ens</span> (subject), and since, nevertheless, there has to be a bearer of these qualities, the mystical idea becomes this bearer. The dualism consists in the fact that Hegel does not look upon the general as being the actual nature of the actual finite, i.e., of what exists and is determinate, or upon the actual <span class="c1">ens</span> as the <span class="c1">true subject</span> of the infinite.</p>
