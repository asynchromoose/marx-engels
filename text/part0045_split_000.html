Leading Russian Populists occasionally wrote to Marx and Engels, either to elicit their views on the Russian situation or to defend their own views. One of them, Pyotr Tkachov, wrote an “Open Letter” to Engels in 1874, and Engels’ reply, “On Social Relations in Russia,” is the fullest statement of his own and Marx’s appraisal of Russian society in the late nineteenth century and the prospects for revolution there. Following the essay is a statement on the same subject from Marx’s letter of March 8, 1881, to a Russian radical, Vera Zasulich.</p>
