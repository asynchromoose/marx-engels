Surveying changes in the European scene over the more than forty years since Marx’s pamphlet was written, Engels hailed the steady progress made by Social Democracy, particularly in Germany, through the electoral process. His endorsement of peaceful political tactics was further accentuated when, in March, 1895, <span class="c1">Vorwärts</span>, the central organ of the German Social Democratic Party, printed an abbreviated version of the Introduction featuring those portions of it which, as Engels complained in a private letter, could serve to “defend the tactics of peace at all costs and of the abhorrence of force . . .” On April 1, 1895, Engels wrote further to Karl Kautsky: “. . . I see today in the <span class="c1">Vorwärts</span> an extract from my Introduction, printed without my prior knowledge and trimmed in such a fashion that I appear as a peaceful worshipper of legality <span class="c1">quand même</span>. So much the more would I like the Introduction to appear unabridged in the <span class="c1">Neue Zeit</span>, so that this disgraceful impression will be wiped out.” Even in its unabridged form, however, as printed here, the Introduction is notable for its hearty approval of the tactics that had evolved in Social Democratic practice in the late nineteenth century. For the work by Marx for which Engels wrote this introduction, see below, pp. 586–593.</p>
