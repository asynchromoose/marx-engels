It proclaims the need for a “radical revolution” as the way to man’s self-realization. Germany is taken as the focal point of this revolution, and the proletariat—the concept of which makes its first appearance in Marx’s, writings here—as its class vehicle. In August1844 Marx sent a copy of the essay to Ludwig Feuerbach along with a long letter expressing love and respect for that thinker, whose writing had provided, he wrote, a “philosophical foundation for socialism” by bringing the idea of the human species from “the heaven of abstraction to the real earth.” Feuerbach’s influence, along with that of Hegel, is clearly visible in the essay.</p>
