The passage setting forth the materialist conception of history—one of the few general statements of the theory that Marx gave in his middle and later years—is the <span class="c1">locus classicus</span> of historical materialism. But the preface is also important as an account by Marx himself of the formative period of Marxism. As such it forms an appropriate introduction to the writings of 1837–1846 gathered here in Part I. The “criticism of post-Hegelian philosophy” which he mentions in the third-to-last paragraph is a reference to his work <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span>, written jointly with Engels.</p>
