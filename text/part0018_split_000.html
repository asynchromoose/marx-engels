We abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice, all the more willingly as we had achieved our main purpose—self-clarification.”<a id="footnote-ref160" href="part0057.html#footnote160" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">160</sup></span></a> The work was first published in 1932 by the Marx Engels Institute in Moscow.</p><p class="s8">The original difficulty of publication was very probably connected with the fact that most of this very bulky work consisted of satirically written, rather and polemics against Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner, Karl Grün, and others. But Part I (here presented in full) is a different matter. Although polemical at various points, it is basically a work of exposition. It gives every appearance of being the work for which the “Theses on Feuerbach” served as an outline; hence we may infer that it was written by Marx. It is, in essence, a restatement, minus much of the German philosophical terminology, of the theory of history adumbrated in the manuscripts of 1844. Marx now calls it the “materialist conception of history.” It is particularly valuable and important to the student of Marxist thought because Marx never again set down a comprehensive statement of his theory of history at such length and in such detail. This point is not contradicted by Engels’ remark in the 1888 foreword that the exposition of the materialist conception of history in <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> “proves only how incomplete our knowledge of economic history still was at that time.”</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0"><span class="c1">The German Ideology</span> has recently appeared in a re-edited version containing several previously unknown pages of the manuscript that were discovered in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, where the original manuscript is kept. Part I appears here in this new and fuller version as translated from the German and edited by S. Ryazanskaya, and published in English by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in 1964. In preparing this new translation, the translator made use of an earlier English translation made by W. Lough and edited by R. Pascal.</p>
