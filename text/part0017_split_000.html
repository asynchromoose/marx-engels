More than forty years later, Engels found them in one of the notebooks that had come into his possession after his friend died. He published them as an appendix to his essay of 1888 on <span class="c1">Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy</span>, and described them in the foreword to this essay as “the brilliant germ of the new world outlook.” They have fascinated Marx scholars ever since, and an extensive literature of exegesis of the “Theses” has accumulated. The eleventh thesis, in which Marx proclaims it the task of philosophy not simply to interpret but to change the world, is one of his most frequently quoted statements.</p><p class="s8">Before resorting to commentaries, however, the reader should apply himself to Marx’s own amplification of the “Theses” in Part 1 of <span class="c1">The German Ideology</span>, which follows this selection.</p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">Engels made a few small changes in the “Theses” when he published them in 1888: he added the phrase “in Robert Owen, for example,” in parentheses, at the end of the first paragraph of Thesis III; italicized “social product” in Thesis VII; italicized “contemplative” and placed quotation marks around “civil society” in Thesis IX. The version presented below is Marx’s.</p>
