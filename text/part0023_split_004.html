<p class="s33">D. The Development of Exchange and of Capital</p><p class="s29">Original accumulation of capital. (The real accumulation).—Once developed historically, capital itself creates the conditions of its existence (not as conditions for its arising, but as results of its being).—(Performance of personal services, as opposed to wage labour.)—Inversion of the law of appropriation. Real alien relation <span class="c4">[Fremdheit]</span> of the worker to his product. Division of labour. Machinery etc.</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">Once production founded on capital is presupposed<span class="c1">—</span>money has become transformed into capital actually only at the <span class="c1">end of the first production</span> process, which resulted in its reproduction and in the new production of surplus capital I; surplus capital I, however, is itself <span class="c1">posited</span>, realized as surplus capital, only when it has produced surplus capital II, i.e. as soon as those presuppositions of money, while it is in the process of passing over into capital, which still lie outside the movement of <span class="c1">real </span>capital have vanished, and when capital has therefore itself posited, and posited in accordance with its immanent essence, the conditions which form its point of departure in production—[then] the condition that the capitalist, in order to posit himself as capital, must bring values into circulation which he created with his own labour—or by some other means, excepting only already available, previous wage labour—belongs among the antediluvian conditions of capital, belongs to its <span class="c1">historic presuppositions,</span> which, precisely as such <span class="c1">historic</span> presuppositions, are past and gone, and hence belong to the <span class="c1">history of its formation,</span> but in no way to its <span class="c1">contemporary</span> history, i.e. not to the real system of the mode of production ruled by it. While e.g. the flight of serfs to the cities is one of the <span class="c1">historic</span> conditions and presuppositions of urbanism, it is not a <span class="c1">condition</span>, not a moment of the reality of developed cities, but belongs rather to their past presuppositions, to the presuppositions of their becoming which are suspended in their being. The conditions and presuppositions of the <span class="c1">becoming</span>, of the <span class="c1">arising</span>, of capital presuppose precisely that it is not yet in being but merely in <span class="c1">becoming;</span> they therefore disappear as real capital arises, capital which itself, on the basis of its own reality, posits the conditions for its realization. Thus e.g. while the process in which money or value for-itself originally becomes capital presupposes on the part of the capitalist an accumulation—perhaps by means of savings garnered from products and values created by his own labour etc., which he has undertaken as a <span class="c1">not-capitalist</span>, i.e. while the presuppositions under which money becomes capital appear as given, external <span class="c1">presuppositions</span> for the arising of capital—[nevertheless,] as soon as capital has become capital as such, it creates its own presuppositions, i.e. the possession of the real conditions of the creation of new values <span class="c1">without exchange</span>—by means of its own production process. These presuppositions, which originally appeared as conditions of its becoming—and hence could not spring from its <span class="c1">action as capital</span>—now appear as results of its own realization, reality, as <span class="c1">posited by it—not as conditions of its arising, but as results of its presence.</span> It no longer proceeds from presuppositions in order to become, but rather it is itself presupposed, and proceeds from itself to create the conditions of its maintenance and growth. Therefore, the conditions which preceded the creation of surplus capital I, or which express the becoming of capital, do not fall into the sphere of that mode of production for which capital serves as the presupposition; as the historic preludes of its becoming, they lie behind it, just as the processes by means of which the earth made the transition from a liquid sea of fire and vapour to its present form now lie beyond its life as finished earth. That is, individual capitals can continue to arise e.g. by means of hoarding. But the hoard is transformed into capital only by means of the exploitation of labour. The bourgeois economists who regard capital as an eternal and <span class="c1">natural</span> (not historical) form of production then attempt at the same time to legitimize it again by formulating the conditions of its becoming as the conditions of its contemporary realization; i.e. presenting the moments in which the capitalist still appropriates as not-capitalist—because he is still becoming—as the very conditions in which he appropriates <span class="c1">as capitalist</span>. These attempts at apologetics demonstrate a guilty conscience, as well as the inability to bring the mode of appropriation of capital as capital into harmony with the general laws of property proclaimed by capitalist society itself. On the other side, much more important for us is that our method indicates the points where historical investigation must enter in, or where bourgeois economy as a merely historical form of the production process points beyond itself to earlier historical modes of production. In order to develop the laws of bourgeois economy, therefore, it is not necessary to write the <span class="c1">real history of the relations of production.</span> But the correct observation and deduction of these laws, as having themselves become<a id="footnote-ref225" href="part0057.html#footnote225" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">225</sup></span></a> in history, always leads to primary equations—like the empirical numbers e.g. in natural science—which point towards a past lying behind this system. These indications [<span class="c1">Andeutung</span>], together with a correct grasp of the present, then also offer the key to the understanding of the past—a work in its own right which, it is to be hoped, we shall be able to undertake as well.<a id="footnote-ref226" href="part0057.html#footnote226" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">226</sup></span></a> This correct view likewise leads to the same time to the points at which the suspension of the present form of production relations gives signs of its becoming—foreshadowings of the future. Just as, on one side the prebourgeois phases appear as <span class="c1">merely historical,</span> i.e. suspended presuppositions, so do the contemporary conditions of production likewise appear as engaged in <span class="c1">suspending themselves</span> and hence in positing the <span class="c1">historic presuppositions</span> for a new state of society.</p><p class="s8">Now, if we initially examine the relation such as it has become, value having become capital, and living labour confronting it as mere use value, so that living labour appears as a mere means to realize objectified, dead labour, to penetrate it with an animating soul while losing its own soul to it—and having produced, as the end-product, alien wealth on one side and [, on the other,] the penury which is living labour capacity’s sole possession—then the matter is simply this, that the process itself, in and by itself, posits to an alien, and if capital were willing to pay it <span class="c1">without</span> making it labour it would enter the bargain with pleasure. Thus labour capacity’s own labour is as alien to it—and it really is, as regards its direction etc.—as are material and instrument. Which is why the product then appears to it as a combination of alien material, alien instrument and alien labour—as <span class="c1">alien property</span>, and why, after production, it has become poorer by the life forces expended, but otherwise begins the drudgery anew, existing as a mere subjective labour capacity separated from the conditions of its life. The recognition [<span class="c1">Erkennung</span>] of the products as its own, and the judgement that its separation from the conditions of its realization is improper—forcibly imposed—is an enormous [advance in] awareness [<span class="c1">Bewusstsein</span>]; itself the product of the mode of production resting on capital, and as much the knell to its doom as, with the slave’s awareness that he <span class="c1">cannot be the property of another</span>, with his consciousness of himself as a person, the existence of slavery becomes a merely artificial, vegetative existence, and ceases to be able to prevail as the basis of production.</p><p class="s8">However, if we consider the original relation, before the entry of money into the self-realization process, then various conditions appear which have to have arisen, or been given historically, for money to become capital and labour to become capital-positing, capital-creating labour, wage labour. (<span class="c1">Wage labour</span>, here, in the strict economic sense in which we use it here, and no other—and we will later have to distinguish it from other forms of labour for day-wages etc.—is capital-positing, capital-producing labour, i.e., living labour which produces both the objective conditions of its realization as an activity, as well as the objective moments of its being as labour <span class="c1">capacity</span>, and produces them as alien powers opposite itself, as <span class="c1">values for-themselves, independent of it</span>.) The essential conditions are themselves posited in the relation as it appears originally: (1) on the one side the presence of living labour capacity as a merely <span class="c1">subjective</span> existence, separated from the <span class="c1">conditions</span> of living labour as well as from the <span class="c1">means of existence, the necessary goods,</span> the means of self-preservation of living <span class="c1">labour capacity;</span> the living possibility of labour, on the one side, in this complete abstraction; (2) the value, or objectified labour, found on the other side, must be an accumulation of use values sufficiently large to furnish the objective conditions not only for the production of the products or values required to reproduce or maintain living labour capacity, but also for the absorption of surplus labour—to supply the objective material for the latter; (3) a free exchange relation—money circulation—between both sides; between the extremes a relation founded on exchange values—not on the master-servant relation—i.e., hence, production which does not directly furnish the producer with his necessaries, but which is mediated through exchange, and which cannot therefore usurp alien labour directly, but must buy it, exchange it, from the worker himself; finally (4) one side—the side representing the objective conditions of labour in the form of independent values for-themselves—must present itself as <span class="c1">value</span>, and must regard the positing of value, self-realization, money-making, as the ultimate purpose—not direct consumption of the creation of use value. </p><p class="s8">So long as <span class="c1">both</span> sides exchange their labour with one another in the form of <span class="c1">objectified</span> labour, the relation is impossible; it is likewise impossible if <span class="c1">living labour capacity</span> itself appears as the property of the other side, hence as not engaged in exchange. (The fact that slavery is possible at individual points within the bourgeois system of production does not contradict this. However, slavery is then possible there only because it does not exist at other points; and appears as an anomaly opposite the bourgeois system itself.).</p><p class="s8">The conditions under which the relation appears at the origin, or which appear as the historic presuppositions of its becoming, reveal at first glance a two-sided character—on one side, dissolution of lower forms of living labour; on the other, dissolution of happier forms of the same.</p><p class="s8">The first presupposition, to begin with, is that the relation of slavery or serfdom has been suspended. Living labour capacity belongs to itself, and has disposition over the expenditure of its forces, through exchange. Both sides confront each other as persons. <span class="c1">Formally</span>, their relation has the equality and freedom of exchange as such. As far as concerns the legal relation, the fact that this form is a mere <span class="c1">semblance</span>, and a <span class="c1">deceptive semblance</span>, appears as an <span class="c1">external matter</span>. What the free worker sells is always nothing more than a specific, particular measure of force-expenditure [<span class="c1">Kraftäusserung</span>]; labour capacity as a totality is greater than every particular expenditure. He sells the particular expenditure of force to a particular capitalist, whom he confronts as an independent <span class="c1">individual</span>. It is clear that this is not his relation to the existence of capital as capital, i.e. to the capitalist class. Nevertheless, in this way everything touching on the individual, real person leaves him a wide field of choice of arbitrary will, and hence of formal freedom. In the slave relation, he belongs to the <span class="c1">individual, particular</span> owner, and is his labouring machine. As a totality of force-expenditure, as labour capacity, he is a thing [<span class="c1">Sache</span>] belonging to another, and hence does not relate as subject to his particular expenditure of force, nor to the act of living labour. In the serf relation he appears as a moment of property in land itself, is an appendage of the soil, exactly like draught-cattle. In the slave relation the worker is nothing but a living labour-machine, which therefore has a value for others, or rather is a value. The totality of the free worker’s labour capacity appears to him as his property, as one of his moments, over which he, as subject, exercises domination, and which he maintains by expending it. This is to be developed later under wage labour.</p><p class="s8">The exchange of objectified labour for living labour does not yet constitute either capital on one side or wage labour on the other. The entire class of so-called <span class="c1">services</span> from the bootblack up to the king falls into this category. Likewise the free day-labourer, whom we encounter sporadically in all places where either the oriental community [<span class="c1">Gemeinwesen</span>] or the western commune [<span class="c1">Gemeinde</span>] consisting of free landowners dissolves into individual elements—as a consequence of increase of population, release of prisoners of war, accidents by which the individual is impoverished and loses the objective conditions of his self-sustaining labour, owing to division of labour etc. If A exchanges a value or money, i.e. objectified labour, in order to obtain a service from B, i.e. living labour, then this can belong:</p><p class="s8">(1) <span class="c1">within the relation of simple circulation</span>. Both in fact exchange only use values with one another; one exchanges necessaries, the other labour, a service which the other wants to consume, either directly—personal service—or he furnishes him the material etc. from which, with his labour, with the objectification of his labour, he makes a use value, a use value designed for A’s consumption. For example, when the peasant takes a wandering tailor, of the kind that existed in times past, into his house, and gives him the material to make clothes with. Or if I give money to a doctor to patch up my health. What is important in these cases is the service which both do for one another. <span class="c1">Do ut facias</span> here appears on quite the same level as <span class="c1">facio ut des</span>, or <span class="c1">do ut des</span>.<a id="footnote-ref227" href="part0057.html#footnote227" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">227</sup></span></a> The man who takes the cloth I supplied to him and makes me an article of clothing out of it gives me a use value. But instead of giving it directly in objective form, he gives it in the form of activity. I give him a completed use value; he completes another for me. The difference between previous, objectified labour and living, present labour here appears as a merely formal difference between the different tenses of labour, at one time in the perfect and at another in the present. It appears in fact as a merely formal difference, a difference mediated by division of labour and by exchange, whether B himself produces the necessaries on which he has to subsist, or whether he obtains them from A and, instead of producing the necessaries himself, produces an article of clothing, in exchange for which he obtains them from A. In both cases he can take possession of the use value possessed by A only by giving him an equivalent for it; which, in the last analysis, always resolves itself into his own living labour, regardless of the objective form it may adopt, whether before the exchange is concluded, or as a consequence of it. Now, the article of clothing not only contains a specific, form-giving labour—a specific form of usefulness imparted to the cloth by the movement of labour—but it contains also a certain quantity of labour—hence not only use value, but <span class="c1">value</span> generally, <span class="c1">value</span> as such. But this value does not exist for A, since he consumes the article, and is not a clothesdealer. He has therefore bought the labour not as <span class="c1">value-positing</span> labour, but as an activity which creates utility, use value. In the case of personal services, this use value is consumed as such without making the transition from the form of movement [<span class="c1">Bewegung</span>] into the form of the object [<span class="c1">Sache</span>]. If, as is frequently the case in simple relations, the performer of the service does not obtain <span class="c1">money</span>, but direct use values themselves, then it no longer even seems as if <span class="c1">value</span> were being dealt in on one or the other side; merely use values. But even given that A pays money for the service, this is not a transformation of his money into capital, but rather the positing of his money as mere medium of circulation, in order to obtain an object for consumption, a specific use value. This act is for that reason not an act which produces wealth, but the opposite, one which consumes wealth. The point for A is not the objectification in the cloth of labour as such, of a certain amount of labour time, hence <span class="c1">value</span>, but rather the satisfaction of a certain need. Here A sees his money not <span class="c1">realized</span> but <span class="c1">devalued</span> in its transposition from the form of value into that of use value. Labour is here exchanged not as use value for value, but as itself a particular use value, as value for use. The more frequently A repeats the exchange, the poorer does he become. This exchange is not an <span class="c1">act of wealth-getting</span> for him, not an act of <span class="c1">value creation</span>, but of <span class="c1">devaluation</span> of the values he has in hand, in his possession. The money which A here exchanges for living labour—service in kind, or service objectified in a thing—is not <span class="c1">capital</span> but revenue, money as a medium of circulation in order to obtain use value, money in which the form of value is posited as merely vanishing, not money which will preserve and realize itself as such through the acquisition of labour. Exchange of <span class="c1">money as revenue</span>, as a mere medium of circulation, for living labour, can never posit money as capital, nor, therefore, labour as wage labour in the economic sense. A lengthy disquisition is not required to show that to consume (spend) money is not the same as to produce money. In situations in which the greatest part of surplus labour appears as agricultural labour, and where the owner of the land therefore appears as owner both of surplus labour and of the surplus product, it is the revenue of the owner of the land which forms the labour fund for the free worker, for the worker in manufactures (here, hand crafts) as opposed to the agricultural labourers. The exchange with them<a id="footnote-ref228" href="part0057.html#footnote228" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">228</sup></span></a> is a form of the consumption of the owner of the land—he divides another part of his revenue directly—for personal services, often only the illusion of services, with a heap of retainers. In Asiatic societies, where the monarch appears as the exclusive proprietor of the agricultural surplus product, whole cities arise, which are at bottom nothing more than wandering encampments, from the exchange of his revenue with the “free hands,” as Steuart calls them.<a id="footnote-ref229" href="part0057.html#footnote229" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">229</sup></span></a> There is nothing of wage labour in this relation, but it can stand in opposition to slavery and serfdom, though <span class="c1">need</span> not do so, for it always repeats itself under various forms of the overall organization of labour. To the extent that <span class="c1">money</span> mediates this exchange the determination of prices will become important on both sides, but it will do so for A only in so far as he does not want to pay too much for the <span class="c1">use value</span> of the labour; not in so far as he is concerned with its <span class="c1">value</span>. The essence of the relation remains unchanged even if this price, which begins as conventional and traditional, is thereafter increasingly determined economically, first by the relation of demand and supply, finally by the production costs at which the vendors themselves of these living services can be produced; nothing is essentially changed thereby, because the determination of prices remains a merely formal moment for the exchange of mere use values, as before. This determination itself, however, is created by other relations, by the general laws and the self-determination of the ruling mode of production, acting, as it were, behind the back of this particular act of exchange. One of the forms in which this kind of pay [<span class="c1">Besoldung</span>] first appears in the old communities is where an <span class="c1">army</span> is maintained. The pay [<span class="c1">Sold</span>] of the common soldier is also reduced to a minimum—determined purely by the production costs necessary to procure him. But he exchanges the performance of his services not for <span class="c1">capital</span>, but for the revenue of the state.</p><p class="s8">In the bourgeois society itself, all exchange of personal services for revenue—including labour for personal consumption, cooking, sewing etc., garden work etc., up to and including all of the unproductive classes, civil servants, physicians, lawyers, scholars etc.—belongs under this rubric, within this category. All menial servants etc. By means of their services—often coerced—all these workers, from the least to the highest, obtain for themselves a share of the surplus product, of the capitalist’s <span class="c1">revenue</span>. But it does not occur to anyone to think that by means of the exchange of his revenue for such services, i.e., through private consumption, the capitalist posits himself as capitalist. Rather, he thereby spends the fruits of his capital. It does not change the nature of the relation that the proportions in which revenue is exchanged for this kind of living labour are themselves determined by the general laws of production.</p><p class="s8">As we have already mentioned in the section on <span class="c1">money</span>,<a id="footnote-ref230" href="part0057.html#footnote230" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">230</sup></span></a> it is here rather the performer of the service who actually posits <span class="c1">value;</span> who transposes a use value—a certain kind of labour, service etc.—into <span class="c1">value, money</span>. Hence in the Middle Ages, those who are oriented towards the production and accumulation of money proceed partly not from the side of the consuming landed nobility, but quite the opposite, from the side of living labour; they accumulate and thus become capitalists, δυναμει, for a later period. The emancipated serf becomes, in part, the capitalist.</p><p class="s8">It thus does not depend on the general relation, but rather on the natural, particular quality of the service performed, whether the recipient of payment receives it as day-wages, or as an honorarium, or as a sinecure—and whether he appears as superior or inferior in rank to the person paying for the service. However, with the presupposition of capital as the dominant power, all these relations become more or less <span class="c1">dishonoured</span>. But this does not belong here yet—this <span class="c1">demystification </span>[<span class="c1">Entgötterung</span>] of personal services, regardless of the lofty character with which tradition may have poetically endowed them.</p><p class="s8">It is not, then, simply the exchange of <span class="c1">objectified labour</span> for <span class="c1">living</span> labour—which appear, from this standpoint, as two different aspects, as use values in different forms, the one objective, the other subjective—which constitutes capital and hence wage labour, but rather, the exchange of objectified labour as <span class="c1">value</span>, as self-sufficient value, for living labour as <span class="c1">its </span>use value, as use value not for a specific, particular use or consumption, but as use value for <span class="c1">value</span>.</p><p class="s8">In the exchange of money for labour or service, with the aim of direct consumption, a real exchange always takes place; the fact that <span class="c1">amounts of labour</span> are exchanged on both sides is of merely formal interest for measuring the <span class="c1">particular</span> forms of the utility of labour by comparing them with each other. This concerns only the <span class="c1">form</span> of the exchange; but does not form its <span class="c1">content</span>. In the exchange of capital for labour, <span class="c1">value</span> is not a measure for the exchange of two use values, but is rather the <span class="c1">content of the exchange</span> itself.</p><p class="s8">(2) In periods of the dissolution of <span class="c1">pre-bourgeois</span> relations, there sporadically occur free workers whose services are bought for purposes not of consumption, but of <span class="c1">production;</span> but, <span class="c1">firstly,</span> even if on a large scale, for the production only of <span class="c1">direct</span> use values, not of <span class="c1">values;</span> and <span class="c1">secondly</span>, if a nobleman e.g. brings the free worker together with his serfs, even if he re-sells a part of the worker’s product, and the free worker thus creates <span class="c1">value</span> for him, then this exchange takes place only for the superfluous [product] and only for the sake of superfluity, for <span class="c1">luxury consumption;</span> is thus at bottom only a veiled purchase of alien labour for immediate consumption or as use value. Incidentally, wherever these free workers increase in number, and where this relation grows, there the old mode of production—commune, patriarchal, feudal etc.—is in the process of dissolution, and the elements of real wage labour are in preparation. But these free servants [<span class="c1">Knechte</span>] can also emerge, as e.g. in Poland etc., and vanish again, without a change in the mode of production taking place.</p><p class="s8">In order to express the relations into which capital and wage labour enter as <span class="c1">property relations</span> or <span class="c1">laws</span>, we need do no more than express the conduct of both sides in the <span class="c1">realization process</span> as an <span class="c1">appropriation process.</span> For example, the fact that surplus labour is posited as surplus value of capital means that the worker does not appropriate the product of his own labour; that it appears to him as <span class="c1">alien property;</span> inversely, that <span class="c1">alien labour</span> appears as the property of capital. This second law of bourgeois property, the inversion of the first—which, through laws of inheritance etc., attains an existence independent of the accidental transitoriness of individual capitalists—becomes just as established in law as the first. The first is the identity of labour with property; the second, labour as negated property, or property as negation of the alien quality of alien labour. In fact, in the production process of capital, as will be seen more closely in its further development, labour is a totality—a combination of labours—whose individual component parts are alien to one another, so that the overall process as a totality is <span class="c1">not</span> the <span class="c1">work</span> of the individual worker, and is furthermore the work of the different workers together only to the extent that they are [forcibly] combined, and do not [voluntarily] enter into combination with one another. The combination of this labour appears just as subservient to and led by an alien will and an alien intelligence—having its <span class="c1">animating unity</span> elsewhere—as its material unity appears subordinate to the <span class="c1">objective unity</span> of the <span class="c1">machinery</span>, of fixed capital, which, as <span class="c1">animated monster</span>, objectifies the scientific idea, and is in fact the coordinator, does not in any way relate to the individual worker as his instrument; but rather he himself exists as an animated individual punctuation mark, as its living isolated accessory. Thus, combined labour is combination <span class="c1">in-itself</span> in a double way; not combination as a mutual relation among the individuals working together, nor as their predominance either over their particular or individual function or over the instrument of labour. Hence, just as the worker relates to the product of his labour as an alien thing, so does he relate to the combination of labour as an alien combination, as well as to his own labour as an expression of his life, which, although it belongs to him, is alien to him and coerced from him, and which A. Smith etc. therefore conceives as a <span class="c1">burden, sacrifice</span> etc.<a id="footnote-ref231" href="part0057.html#footnote231" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">231</sup></span></a> Labour itself, like its product, is <span class="c1">negated as the labour of the particular, isolated worker</span>. This isolated labour, negated, is now indeed communal or combined labour, posited. The <span class="c1">communal or, combined labour</span> posited in this way—as activity and in the passive, objective form—is however at the same time posited as an other towards the really existing individual labour—as an <span class="c1">alien objectivity</span> (alien property) as well as an <span class="c1">alien subjectivity</span> (of capital). Capital thus represents both labour and its product as negated individualized labour and hence as the negated property of the individualized worker. Capital therefore is the existence of social labour—the combination of labour as subject as well as object—but this existence as itself existing independently opposite its real moments—hence itself a particular existence apart from them. For its part, capital therefore appears as the predominant subject and owner of <span class="c1">alien labour</span>, and its relation is itself as complete a contradiction as is that of wage labour.&gt;</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s25" id="calibre_pb_8">* * *</p>
