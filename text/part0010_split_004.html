<p class="s30">Politics: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern</p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s8">In the states of antiquity the political state makes up the content of the state to the exclusion of the other spheres. The modern state is a compromise between the political and the unpolitical state.</p><p class="s8">In democracy the <span class="c1">abstract </span>state has ceased to be the dominant factor. The struggle between monarchy and republic is itself still a struggle within the abstract state. The <span class="c1">political</span> republic is democracy within the abstract state form. The abstract state form of democracy is therefore the republic; but here it ceases to be the <span class="c1">merely political</span> constitution.</p><p class="s8">Property, etc., in short, the entire content of the law and the state, is the same in North America as in Prussia, with few modifications. The <span class="c1">republic</span> there is thus a mere state <span class="c1">form</span>, as is the monarchy here. The content of the state lies outside these constitutions. Hegel is right, therefore, when he says: The political state is the constitution, i.e., the material state is not political. What obtains here is merely an external identity, a determination of changing forms. Of the various elements of national life, the one most difficult to evolve was the political state, the constitution. It developed as universal reason over against the other spheres, as ulterior to them. The historical task then consisted in its [the constitution’s] reassertion, but the particular spheres do not realise that their private nature coincides with the other-worldly nature of the constitution or of the political state, and that the other-worldly existence of the political state is nothing but the affirmation of their own estrangement. Up till now the <span class="c1">political constitution</span> has been the <span class="c1">religious sphere</span>, the <span class="c1">religion</span> of national life, the heaven of its generality over against the <span class="c1">earthy existence</span> of its actuality. The political sphere has been the only state sphere in the state, the only sphere in which the content as well as the form has been species-content, the truly general; but in such a way that at the same time, because this sphere has confronted the others, its content has also become formal and particular. <span class="c1">Political life</span> in the modern sense is the <span class="c1">scholasticism</span> of national life. <span class="c1">Monarchy</span> is the perfect expression of this estrangement. The <span class="c1">republic</span> is the negation of this estrangement within its own sphere. It is obvious that the political constitution as such is brought into being only where the private spheres have won an independent existence. Where trade and landed property are not free and have not yet become independent, the political constitution too does not yet exist. The Middle Ages were the <span class="c1">democracy of unfreedom</span>.</p><p class="s8">The abstraction of the <span class="c1">state as such</span> belongs only to modern times, because the abstraction of private life belongs only to modern times. The abstraction of the <span class="c1">political state</span> is a modern product.</p><p class="s8">In the Middle Ages there were serfs, feudal estates, merchant and trade guilds, corporations of scholars, etc.: that is to say, in the Middle Ages property, trade, society, man are <span class="c1">political;</span> the material content of the state is given by its form; every private sphere has a political character or is a political sphere; that is, politics is a characteristic of the private spheres too. In the Middle Ages the political constitution is the constitution of private property, but only because the constitution of private property is a political constitution. In the Middle Ages the life of the nation and the life of the state are identical. Man is the actual principle of the state—but <span class="c1">unfree</span> man. It is thus the <span class="c1">democracy of unfreedom</span>—estrangement carried to completion. The abstract reflected antithesis belongs only to the modern world. The Middle Ages are the period of <span class="c1">actual</span> dualism; modern times, one of <span class="c1">abstract</span> dualism.</p><p class="s8">“We have already noted the stage at which the division of constitutions into democracy, aristocracy and monarchy has been made—the standpoint, that is, of that unity which is still <span class="c1">substantial, which still remains within itself and has not yet come to its process of infinite differentiation and inner deepening:</span> at that stage, the element of the <span class="c1">final self-determining resolution of the will</span> does not emerge explicitly into its <span class="c1">own proper actuality</span> as an <span class="c1">immanent </span>organic factor in the state.” In the spontaneously evolved monarchy, democracy and aristocracy there is as yet no political constitution as distinct from the actual, material state or the other content of the life of the nation. The political state does not yet appear as the <span class="c1">form</span> of the material state. Either, as in Greece, the <span class="c1">res publica</span><a id="footnote-ref48" href="part0057.html#footnote48" class="calibre8"><span class="c1"><sup class="calibre9">48</sup></span></a> is the real private affair of the citizens, their real content, and the private individual is a slave; the political state, <span class="c1">qua</span> political state, being the true and only content of the life and will of the citizens; or, as in an Asiatic despotism, the political state is nothing but the personal caprice of a single individual; or the political state, like the material state, is a slave. What distinguishes the modern state from these states characterized by the substantial unity between people and state is not, as Hegel would have it, that the various elements of the constitution have been developed into <span class="c1">particular</span> actuality, but that the constitution itself has been developed into a <span class="c1">particular</span> actuality alongside the actual life of the people—that the political state has become the <span class="c1">constitution</span> of the rest of the state. </p><p class="s8"> </p><p class="s25" id="calibre_pb_8">* * *</p>
