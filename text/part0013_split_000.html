Between April and August of 1844 he produced the rough draft of what, judging by his preface, was to have been a book. He did not finish it for publication, however, and it lay unpublished for more than eighty years. The surviving parts, comprising four manuscripts, were given the name shown above. An incomplete version in Russian translation was published in Moscow in 1927. The first full edition in German, prepared by D. Riazanov of the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow, was published in Berlin in 1932, in <span class="c1">Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe.</span> </p><p class="s8">The fundamentals of the Marxist interpretation of history are to be found in the 1844 manuscripts, including the notion of the proletarian revolution and future communism as the goal of the historical process. The theory is set forth, however, in terms of philosophical concepts drawn by Marx from Hegel and Feuerbach, most notably the concept of man’s “self-alienation” or “self-estrangement.” History, particularly under modern capitalism, is seen as a story of man’s alienation in his life as producer, and communism is presented as the final transcendence of alienation via a revolution against private property. Because the 1844 manuscripts show us Marxism at the moment of its genesis in Marx’s mind and because they help to clarify both the relation of Marxism to earlier German philosophy and its ethical significance, their publication has profoundly affected scholarship on Marx and Marxism in our time.</p><p class="s8">A part of the manuscripts consists largely of excerpts from writings of the political economists on such topics as wages of labor, profit of capital, and rent of land. The material reprinted here, comprising the extant portions in which Marx expounds his own position, consists of the preface and the sections entitled “Estranged Labour,” “Private Property and Communism,” “The Meaning of Human Requirements,” “The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society,” and “Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole.”</p><p class="s8">A number of passages in the manuscripts have been crossed out, apparently by Marx. There is no reason to think that the passages crossed out had ceased to represent what Marx thought. He may well have been guided by editorial considerations in working over the draft of a manuscript originally intended for publication.”<a id="footnote-ref99" href="part0057.html#footnote99" class="calibre8"><span><sup class="calibre9">99</sup></span></a></p><p class="s17" id="calibre_pb_0">The translation and notes are by Martin Milligan.</p>
