			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>SELECTING A COLLEGE</b></h1>
			<p>As your child progresses in high school and enters his last two years, thoughts turn more seriously to college, specifically to his choice of school(s) and the upcoming high-stakes standardized tests such as the PSAT, the SAT, the ACT, and AP achievement tests.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>A BIT OF PERSPECTIVE ON COLLEGE ADMISSIONS</b></h2>
			<p>College choice involves many types of issues and preferences. My focus here is on specific issues that should be considered by a student who is dyslexic. Overall, you should aim high while at the same time giving yourself a broad range of choices. If you have an academic and personal record of achievement (even with a few inevitable disappointments here and there), don’t be afraid to apply to rigorous schools, including those in the Ivy League.</p>
			<p class="indent">My own institution, Yale University, understands dyslexia and welcomes deserving students who are dyslexic into its undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools. When I first came to Yale, I was invited to meet with the admissions committee and did so regularly. At these meetings I would review the admissions packets of students applying to Yale who may have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_375" title="375"/>in some way indicated or whose records suggested that they had a learning disability, most often dyslexia. My role was educational: to bring to the attention of committee members the rapidly growing scientific knowledge of dyslexia and to ensure that aspects of dyslexia such as slow reading or needing additional time on tests were not misinterpreted as an indicator of cognitive limitations. The admissions dean and committee members came to appreciate the unexpected nature of dyslexia as well as the challenges it presents. The admissions process was successful because the committee was determined to admit the best students and the university was committed to providing the support that would ensure that dyslexic students’ performance on tests reflected their ability rather than their disability. Yale has the same high rigorous admissions standards for dyslexic students that it has for every other applicant. Having visited other universities, I have come to appreciate that the key to Yale’s success with dyslexic students is its genuine understanding of the paradox that is dyslexia. The university does not misinterpret and get waylaid by such characteristics of dyslexia as slow reading. Rather, Yale takes into account the whole person, including the often incredible strengths of deep intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, persistence, and grit that the dyslexic applicant brings to the school.</p>
			<p class="indent">Yale, too, has been very fortunate to have extraordinary, visionary leaders such as Linda Lorimer, who in her roles as university secretary, university vice president, and most recently senior counselor to the president vigorously supported and continues to strongly support the university’s commitment to excellence. Although she has now retired, her advice and perspective continue to be sought out.</p>
			<p class="indent">Happily, admissions officers in colleges and universities around the country are demonstrating increasing understanding of dyslexia, including the potential of these students to succeed in higher education, and indeed in life. Our Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity has been honored to help foster this increased understanding by sponsoring two conferences, one at Yale, the other at Stanford, both titled “Diamonds in the Rough: Why Every Institution of Higher Learning Should Want to Attract and Admit Dyslexic Students.” The audience for these events consisted of the deans of admission from colleges across the country who benefited from hearing from such eminent dyslexics as Cleveland Clinic CEO and renowned cardiac surgeon Dr. Delos (Toby) Cosgrove; then California lieutenant governor, now governor, Gavin Newsom; and financier Charles Schwab, each of whom described his early struggles with dyslexia and his current successes. The attendees also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_376" title="376"/>heard about the results of the Yale Outcome Study, which demonstrated that when followed into the working world after graduating from Yale, dyslexic alums performed extremely well in virtually all areas.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hearing one after another dyslexic student and adult compellingly describe how they had succeeded in college was quite meaningful to the attending deans. Greg Buckles of Middlebury and McGreggor Crowley of MIT, along with many other attendees, indicated that they gained a new and deeply valued understanding of dyslexia, including insight into how best to evaluate the potential of dyslexic students to succeed at their respective schools.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>STEPS IN SELECTING THE RIGHT COLLEGE</b></h2>
			<p>Dyslexics, like any other students, will want to consider location of the school (urban versus rural), school size, and courses and majors offered. There are also special factors that enter into the college selection process for students who are dyslexic.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>RESOURCE OFFICE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c27-ftn-1" id="c27-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup></b></h3>
			<p>
				It may surprise some to hear that a majority of dyslexic students, and I, too, would <i>rank the disability or resource office right at or very near the top of the list of special considerations in selecting a college.</i> This office and its staff can make a meaningful difference in the success or failure of a dyslexic student at a particular college. When functioning optimally, such offices serve as a welcome and highly effective bastion of support for a dyslexic student.</p>
			<p class="indent">Given its special role, what should a potential student look for in assessing the resource office at a particular college? As a first step, check out services for students with disabilities at your top-choice schools. If you have difficulty finding the resource office, go to the school’s website and type in the word <i>disability,</i> or simply Google the school with the search word <i>disability.</i> To quote Judy York, former director of the Yale University Resource Office on Disabilities, “If the school doesn’t advertise a disability office, beware. Be scared.” Indeed, some schools still do not have a formal office. If the school doesn’t identify an office, that suggests that the college doesn’t value it or give meaningful support to it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_377" title="377"/>Izer’s experience of support and personal interest at Penn contributed to his positive experience at the school. As he put it while he was an undergraduate,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>They’re great. They treat me as if they are my mom. Pam, my disability staff person, always greets me with a hug. “How are you—anything else you might need?” She sort of pushes me, just because she really wants me to succeed and do well. That’s the sort of rapport I’ve gained with Pam.</p>
				<p class="indent">At the beginning of my freshman year, sometimes if I forgot I have to sign up to get accommodations for my exams, she would actually take the time to email me and say, “Izer, I haven’t seen that you are signed up.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">This attitude from the resource office serves students well. As one resource staffer explained to me, “As long as you come in, you show that you want to be successful, you’re going to work hard, you gain.” As Izer noted,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					It’s good to visit the person who is in charge of your accommodations just to check in and say hello. It sends the message, <i>I’m here, I’m actually here. I really want to do this, to succeed, I want to get as much help as I can.</i> Then it looks good on your behalf, and they’re more willing to help you.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>A very clear message emerges: <i>Engage in personal interactions with resource personnel as often as you can.</i></p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">You should look for the following in judging a resource office’s ability to meet the needs of a dyslexic student:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Resource office location.</i> Accessibility is critical. Is the office conveniently located so that you can easily drop in during the day as you go to and from your classes or dormitory, or is it at the periphery or edge of the campus so that it is not easily visited? If you are dyslexic, you do not want to attend a college where a resource office costs you time instead of saving you time. Penn and Yale are exemplary in this way. <i>The location of the disability office, central or peripheral, sends a message about how the institution regards disability services.</i></p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_378" title="378"/><i>Office staff and policies.</i> Learn how big a staff the office has and what services it provides.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Make a visit.</i> The resource office should be one of your first stops when you visit a campus. Set up an appointment beforehand to meet with a staff member. You do not want to simply drop in and find the staff fully occupied. You must learn about what accommodations are available and how they are obtained, and if and how foreign-language waivers are available.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Determine whether this office will work for</i> you. Are the people at the resource office welcoming? Is the atmosphere warm and friendly? Would you feel comfortable going there? Does the office look personal and inviting, or does it more resemble a visit to the DMV? Ask students you see at the center how they would sum up their interactions with the staff. Can you have one-on-one interaction with the same person over time if you want? Often the size of the office is a direct function of the number of students attending the school. For example, at Brown University the resource office houses a staff of five; the undergraduate population of Brown is about 6,400. Seventeen men and women staff the disability office at Columbia University in New York City, which has 14,000 full-time students.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 class="head"><b>SCHOOL CULTURE</b></h3>
			<p>Just as school culture is important for dyslexic students attending K–12, it is equally important to these students when they move on to college. When meeting with the disability office, be sure to ask about the culture of the school, especially the culture of the faculty. Would you want to disclose your dyslexia in this environment? You want to know how accessible the professors are, since in the right culture they can play a major role in your life. Professors often devote what some disability office staff have described as “an inordinate amount of extra time, voluntary time, working with students”—meeting after class, going over assignments, guiding the student’s approach to the material, supporting the student in multiple meaningful ways.</p>
			<p class="indent">As Emma, a highly successful dyslexic student at and now graduate of Washington University, says about Cornerstone, the disability services program <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_379" title="379"/>at her school, “You need to have a good support system for accommodations. If I didn’t have Cornerstone, it would have been horrible. They’re so friendly and really fast about responding and taking care of things I need. Cornerstone has made a huge difference for me.”</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>STANDARDIZED TESTING</b></h3>
			<p>
				In addition to learning about the resource office and school culture, you will want to consider whether the school offers <i>optional standardized testing.</i> Does the school <i>allow the student to decide whether or not to submit his or her scores on the high-stakes standardized tests such as the SAT or ACT or to take the test at all?</i> A surprisingly large and increasing number of fine colleges and universities offer optional testing requirements. Growing scientific evidence indicates that students who choose to submit these scores and those who choose not to, do <i>not</i> differ significantly in their GPAs and graduation rates.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the study “Defining Promise: Twenty-Five Years of Optional Testing at Bates College (1984–2009),” presented at our “Diamonds in the Rough” conference, longtime prior Bates admissions head Bill Hiss and coauthor Kate Doria presented data indicating that the number of students applying to Bates who chose not to submit standardized test scores has risen from around 30 percent in 1990 to over 40 percent, and in some years close to 50 percent, of applicants. The difference in GPAs between submitters and nonsubmitters in that report is a minuscule 0.03 of a GPA point (3.16 compared to 3.13). The difference in graduation rates is 1 percent. To quote the authors, “In a word, in a college with very demanding academics, nonsubmitters have earned the same grades and graduated at virtually the same rates as submitters.” <span id="ftn-159"/>In a far larger follow-up study involving 123,000 students attending thirty-three different institutions, Hiss and coauthor Valerie Franks replicated these findings: There were virtually no differences in GPAs or graduation rates between those submitting and not submitting standardized test scores. These findings are obviously relevant for dyslexic students, who often do not perform well on high-stakes standardized tests because of difficulties obtaining appropriate accommodations. As of 2019, over one thousand four-year colleges and universities did not use the SAT or ACT to admit bachelor-degree students. You can go to <a href="http://www.fairtest.org/university/optional">www.fairtest.org/university/optional</a> to view the most up-to-date list of test-optional schools.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you are not planning to apply to a school offering the choice of optional <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_380" title="380"/>testing, you will have registered for either the SAT or ACT, or both, and requested the accommodations necessary for you to demonstrate your ability. The often unexpected delays in reviewing and granting such accommodations should make it a priority for you to get your application for accommodations in as early as possible. The College Board revised the SAT in 2016; a major change was to make the math section text-heavy. <span id="ftn-160"/>This has the unfortunate potential consequence of having students’ math scores reflect their slow reading rather than their math ability.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some students have found it very helpful to review as many questions from prior exams and review books as possible, while others rely on private tutors or specialized test prep companies such as Kaplan and the Princeton Review for directed practice. Review and practice are the key and should be incorporated into plans beginning the summer before the student’s junior year, or early in that year. (Please see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c33_r1.xhtml#page_471">this page</a> for a discussion of changes in requesting accommodations on major tests, including PSAT, SAT, LSAT, and USMLE.) For those who worry about applying to colleges that continue to require SAT or ACT scores, keep in mind that many schools look beyond these scores. As former Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy, who is dyslexic, will tell you, “I was lucky some schools were willing to take a chance on me. My SAT scores were abysmal.”</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>VISITING A SCHOOL</b></h3>
			<p>
				Having done your research and selected possible schools, the next step is to visit each of the schools. I have already discussed the essential visit to the disability office and speaking with a staff member. But of course you will want to see more than one aspect of a college where you hope to spend the next four years. Virtually all schools offer a formal tour, typically led by students attending that college. This gives you a chance to literally see the school and begin to gain a sense of its history and traditions, and to breathe in the atmosphere. Many students have told me they learned the most from an informal visit they carried out on their own. As one student said to me, you are able to get the backstory, a truer vision of the school. During such an informal visit you should speak to a number of students and ask questions about their experiences at the school. It is especially valuable to sit in on classes. This often requires little more than approaching the professor before class to say that you are considering applying to the school and want to see a class in progress. That way you can obtain a sense of whether the professor seems to know or have some kind of relationship with the students. For a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_381" title="381"/>dyslexic student, it is especially important to have one-on-one time with professors and have the professors know your name—all of which is much more likely in a class with a smaller number of students.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>TYPE OF SEMESTER SCHEDULE</b></h3>
			<p>While most schools follow a traditional two-semester school year, some are geared to a trimester (such as Dartmouth) or even a quarter system (such as Stanford). It is important for you to know that things move much more quickly in the trimester and quarter schedules—especially in the quarter system—since each semester is shorter. Reading assignments must be completed quickly, tests come often, and much is covered in a relatively short time. If you need materials from the disability office—for example, text that is digitized to allow accessibility for text-to-speech programs—there is a lot of pressure to have this completed in a hurry. Quarter systems allow very little leeway for getting behind in homework; by the third week of classes, students are often already taking midterms. Having such a fast-paced schedule increases the difficulty and pressure for dyslexic students, though I know of several who have attended and graduated from each of these institutions and been very satisfied. You should not necessarily rule out attending such an institution, but do consider this cautionary note together with other features of the school in determining if the school is the right one.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WHAT KIND OF COLLEGE WON’T WORK FOR A DYSLEXIC STUDENT?</b></h2>
			<p>
				In general, dyslexic students do best in a smaller school, where they can make connections with their professors, meet with them, and give them the chance to get to know them personally. Students who are dyslexic would do well to avoid a very large, impersonal college, a college where each student may be just a number and just another test file and where there is such a heavy bureaucracy that it takes an inordinately long time to get a response to any request. A student who is dyslexic thrives within a smaller community of people who want to help and try to understand the problems he or she may have. Dyslexics, who themselves are often quite empathetic, do better in a more personal, caring environment than in a rote, mechanical one. That said, there are students who have found great support in large state universities, and others who have felt lost and not very well supported in smaller <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_382" title="382"/>colleges. As in everything else in life, it is the individuals you meet and form a relationship with who can make all the difference in the world.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>THE APPLICATION ESSAY</b></h3>
			<p>Should you mention your dyslexia or not? While there is no hard-and-fast rule, a growing number of students are deciding to talk about their dyslexia on their application. Dyslexia is part of who they are, and as one student wrote, “My diagnosis of dyslexia has enabled me to understand myself and to know how I best learn and to take advantage of this self-knowledge and go on to succeed in my studies.” One student acknowledged that “asking for help is one of the hardest things to do, but once I understood my dyslexia I learned how to adapt and that, if needed, asking for help is a positive thing. Learning not to fear asking for help allows me to grow even more as a student who seeks knowledge.”</p>
			<p class="indent">In formulating your essay, think about providing examples of how having and understanding your dyslexia has been a positive influence in making you more determined and unafraid of temporary reversals, and has taught you that with determination and unfailing effort you can succeed in just about any challenge brought before you. As one dyslexic young woman shared with me, “Dyslexia has taught me to be efficient, hardworking, and not to take anything for granted. I am a realist when it comes to knowing what I have to do and for making sure I do it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Here is the last paragraph of the college application essay of Blair Bucshon, now a sophomore at Cornell University, in which she synthesizes and powerfully expresses what being diagnosed with dyslexia has meant to her. It has the positive thrust all such essays should have.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					Last year, I was diagnosed with dyslexia. Finally putting a name to the problem has helped me to better understand how my brain works and the advantages I have because of dyslexia. I know the barriers that stand in my way and can conquer them rather than fighting an invisible enemy. I now recognize that while growing up with dyslexia was difficult, it was not a totally negative experience. I discovered different ways of solving problems that my peers were not able to see. I hope to give others with similar struggles the confidence to succeed like I have. I am blessed and consider myself unbelievably lucky to have the life I do, but I also believe that everyone has a personal journey and hardships to conquer. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_383" title="383"/>struggles of my first eighteen years have taught me how to persevere and the importance of believing in myself when times are tough. Now that I understand my weaknesses, I will never again hide in the back of a classroom, or lecture hall, or board room. Instead, I vow to myself that I will always be the one to stand up first, so that I can conquer my fears and make my best self better every day.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Legally, schools are not permitted to ask if you are disabled or the nature of your disability, so it is not mandatory that you disclose. However, as one admissions officer at our “Diamonds in the Rough” conference said, “It helps when you identify that you are dyslexic, because it often explains the applicant’s story. That’s a real benefit to the student.”</p>

				<p class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="c27-ftn-1" role="doc-footnote"><a href="#c27-ftn1">*</a> Resource offices are undergoing a transition in some universities.
