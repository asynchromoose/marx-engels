			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THE FINEST SPECIALIZED SCHOOLS</b></h1>
			<p>I want to give you a firsthand sense of what happens at a top specialized school, not only in terms of the students’ experience but on the part of the people and principles driving the success of these schools. Such schools offer programs and other benefits for dyslexic children that many parents and educators may not be aware of.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE WINDWARD SCHOOL, JOHN (JAY) RUSSELL, HEAD</b></h2>
			<p>I first met John Russell when I was invited to meet with a group of superintendents on the BOCES (Board of Cooperative Educational Services) for New York State to talk about dyslexia. I asked these educational leaders if they had heard of the National Reading Panel, on which I had recently served. Of the dozen or so superintendents, only John Russell raised his hand. As usual, he was ahead of the crowd.</p>
			<p class="indent">During his tenure as superintendent, Russell was unexpectedly offered the head position at Windward. He had begun as a math and science teacher at a high school, gone on to middle-school level, served as an elementary-school principal, become an assistant superintendent for curriculum instruction, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_328" title="328"/>and, last, served as a superintendent. His vast experience in education left Russell curious about some things he had noticed.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Even when I was a superintendent, I would constantly ask my director of special education, “We keep identifying kids. Why don’t we ever exit kids from this program? Where’s the benefit of the program if the kids aren’t able to return to the mainstream?”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Russell had three major goals when he arrived at Windward.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament">1. </span><i>Emphasizing that our students are smart.</i> To preserve the school’s mission, which is dedicated to clarifying for our parents and, to some extent, the larger general public that our kids are <i>smart.</i> Many people continue to harbor the mistaken idea that our kids are not cognitively able to do so many things that they, indeed, can do. That’s one of the things that I recognized I had to really pay attention to, and I continue to fight that battle. Part of our mission statement is to share our expertise with the broader community. We want to disabuse independent schools and public schools of their notions about our kids so that when they leave here, they can go into a mainstream setting. And so to me, job one was to set important expectations for what our students are capable of doing. In order to serve our students optimally, the school, too, is very specific about which students we will accept—we know the profile of the students who will respond to our program, the curriculum we offer, and the instructional program that we use. <i>We are absolutely steadfast in not accepting any student who doesn’t meet that profile.</i> One of our great strengths is knowing exactly who are the kids we serve, not trying to serve all students with all disabilities but really being laser-focused on kids with dyslexia.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament">2. </span><i>Requiring teacher preparation of all Windward teachers.</i> First there is <i>professional development</i>, the input that teaches them <i>what</i> they need to know. Next is <i>implementation,</i> where the teachers go into the classroom and learn how to apply the <i>what.</i> This gives our future teachers a chance to practice that for a year, and sometimes two years, without actually being responsible for a class. Last, there is <i>evaluation and supervision, </i><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_329" title="329"/>which gives the teachers feedback on how they’re implementing <i>what</i> they learned. Nobody teaches the first year they’re here.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><i>Everything</i> that happens at Windward is <i>intentional.</i> This was formalized by John Russell, and I believe it is one of the major reasons Windward is so successful. For example, the mentoring program includes formal expectations based on mentors’ specific responsibilities. “We really codified what we expected in the mentor-mentee relationship, and we built on that,” he told me.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament">3. </span><i>Instituting a more rigorous reliance on data and data analysis.</i> To accomplish this, Russell insisted that the school aggregate and collect standardized data.</p>
				<p class="list0_nonindent spaceabove">Moving forward, I wanted to aggregate the data so I could tell parents, <i>You know what? For the 1,539 kids who have left during my tenure, I can tell you for a fact, because I have the data and I’ve analyzed it, that 98 percent of them are reading in the average to above-average range in reading comprehension on the standardized test, and that’s normed against a so-called regular ed population.</i> The standardized data were analyzed on a yearly basis. Teacher input and the teacher evaluations are continuously examined in a serious way.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Russell’s MBA gave him an edge.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>One of the things I realized during my MBA is that virtually every innovative corporation invests considerable amounts of money in research and development, but I knew of no school that was actually doing that in a direct manner. So I created a position here—a teacher who’s designated as a research associate. That’s our commitment to staying current with the research. We’ve really focused on research. When we say we use evidence-based practices, we actually mean it and can substantiate it.</p>
				<p class="indent">At the school there is an internal joke: <i>At Windward, in order to get in, you have to fail the entrance exam, and then, when you start doing really well, we ask you to leave.</i> I don’t know of any other school that does that as conscientiously as we do. On average, children stay about four and a half years.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_330" title="330"/>When are they ready to leave? I asked.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>When they’ve internalized all the skills that we’ve taught them. One of the things we pay very close attention to is teaching the kids self-advocacy skills. If a child is able to read and write well—and by that we mean approximating at least grade-level work—then they have to also be able to self-monitor and self-regulate. We’re famous for the structure we provide. That external structure is a surrogate for the self-regulatory skills that these kids have yet to develop.</p>
				<p class="indent">I believe that anything that we call a skill, if it’s a skill, then it can be taught. If it can be taught, it can be learned, and if it can be learned, it can be internalized. When you get the academic skills in place, the self-advocacy and self-regulatory skills in place, that’s when the kids are ready to go.</p>
				<p class="indent">Here is yet another way Windward is <i>intentional</i> about its program: By the time the kids leave eighth grade, they will have written four annotated research papers that are of significant length. We don’t assign that. We teach them that. In the course of teaching that, one of the things they get is a planner. They plan their first paper with the help of the teacher, and then, on the second paper, on their own. They lay out a calendar of benchmarks they have to reach to write a paper in eight weeks. We work backward from that. We lay that out for them very specifically. We teach them something as simple, that often doesn’t get taught, as note-taking. For example, students learn how to extract key words and phrases from text so that you have the key words and phrases and then you write your own sentences, as opposed to plagiarizing and just copying.</p>
				<p class="indent">For another example, the kids are responsible for having a homework notebook. That’s not that uncommon. Every school in the world does, but we have a period at the end of the day called <i>focus.</i> For the last fifteen minutes of every middle-school kid’s day, they return to their homeroom <i>focus</i> classroom where the teacher with the child goes through his homework list. Does the student understand what his homework is? Does he have the books that he needs to do the homework with him? Is there any part of this homework that he feels he’s not ready to deal with? If that’s the case, the teacher in his homeroom will either help start the homework or will send the student back to the teacher who assigned the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_331" title="331"/>homework so he can ask clarifying questions. Yes, we’re intentional about everything we do. We don’t just walk in and wing it.</p>
				<p class="indent">When the kids are getting their reading instruction, they are in groups varying in size. The average size is ten. There are usually two adults in the classroom. One is the master teacher, and one is an assistant teacher. We group homogeneously for the skills-based instruction. Reading is language arts and we do <i>three periods</i> of language arts each day. We do reading in terms of decoding in the younger grades, and then we do connected text, and then we do education and writing. That takes three periods. It’s about two hours.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Russell does not believe children have to have one-to-one instruction.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>We don’t provide one-to-one. In order to get into Windward, you have to have a diagnosis from an evaluation that clearly identifies the child has average to above-average intelligence and dyslexia. That’s the first hurdle. Then you’re in the pool. Then we have you come in, and you visit with us. You actually attend classes for two half-days when we also assess your decoding skill.</p>
				<p class="indent">We have to have a group for you. We usually do have a group, but some kids are outliers, and we don’t have a group for them. As long as we have a group, you’re in. Those are skill-based groups, and they’re fluid. Homogeneous grouping for the purpose of instruction and skills-based classes is, I think, absolutely necessary. Here, kids move from group to group. The groups are fluid, and we move them around. At the end of the day, when the children leave here, whether it’s in sixth grade, fourth grade, or eighth grade, 98 percent of them are reading in the average to above-average range in reading comprehension, and a similar number, 96 percent, in vocabulary.</p>
				<p class="indent">The Windward Teacher Training Institute enhances the program. It was first developed to train our own teachers. We want everyone to understand our larger mission, and so we want to share our expertise with the broader educational community. Last year we provided our own faculty with 11,000 hours of professional development, and we had 1,500 teachers go through our teacher training institute.</p>
				<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_332" title="332"/>There are three core courses that everybody has to take. There’s a direct instruction in reading course. There’s a direct instruction in writing, and then there’s a course in language that’s taught by a speech and language pathologist called language and literacy. Those three courses are an absolute bare minimum. Then we offer courses in direct instruction and mathematics. Every teacher who teaches here is expected to re-enroll in those courses, minimally, once every five years. Our teacher training never ends.</p>
				<p class="indent">Windward’s program has excellent components, but of course the outcome is what matters—and that’s the best part of all. Before students begin at Windward, they take a standardized test in reading and math. We get a baseline of where they are compared to a so-called normal population. Then they take those tests at the end of each year and then I compare their last year’s performance with their pre-performance, and that’s where I get those comparisons—98 percent in reading comprehension at or above their grade level, and also in reading vocabulary with 96 percent at grade level or above.</p>
				<p class="indent">That’s one measure. I’m kind of suspicious of data, so if you presented that to me, I would say, <i>Well, that’s fine. It’s an immediate effect, but is it a persistent effect?</i> For the past ten years, we have surveyed the schools that our kids go to after they leave Windward, and we wait at least two years. We asked the administrator and guidance counselors in these schools, <i>How are our kids doing academically compared to their grade-level peers?</i> Now, 98 percent of that group were in mainstream settings. At the last school where we asked, <i>How are our kids doing,</i> 97 percent were at or above their grade-level peers academically.</p>
				<p class="indent">We’ve also asked them questions like <i>How are they doing in terms of their social-emotional adjustment to the school?</i> Again, we had great results with that. We asked them about participation in extracurricular activities and giving back to the school—fabulous participation in that.</p>
				<p class="indent">The last thing we do is track the secondary schools that our kids have attended. The list of independent and public schools has continued to grow over the past twelve years. More and more schools that would not have in the past taken a kid with a learning disability (most commonly dyslexia) are now taking our kids. Every <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_333" title="333"/>time one of our students goes into one of those schools that has not seen the light, they serve as an ambassador for all those kids who are going to come after them, and our kids do unbelievably well, and they—our kids, our alumni—are the ones who are doing the most heavy lifting and getting the best results in disabusing people of their mistaken ideas about our students’ capabilities.</p>
				<p class="indent">We have kids in every competitive university in this country, including Yale, U. Penn, and Brown. The kid who spoke at graduation who was an alum this past year, he was a Phi Beta Kappa junior year at Harvard, and he just graduated from Harvard. So our kids go to every possible school.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Russell believes passionately in early identification.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Mandatory early identification would be my advice. Early, early, early. What I would tell parents is early detection, early identification, is really the first step into a longer process. If you don’t take that first step, the longer you wait, the steeper the hill you have to climb to get over that hump. The kids that we had detected early, the academic remediation may be as effective with older kids, but the difference is the kids’ self-esteem, which in most cases—not all—has not been damaged. Those kids who have been identified early have not been mistreated by well-intentioned, ill-informed people who have told them to try harder, or you’re so good in art, or you’re so good in math, surely you can read. Just try harder. That would be my advice. Early, early, early identification.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE PARK CENTURY SCHOOL, JUDITH FULLER, HEAD</b></h2>
			<p>The Park Century School (PCS) in Culver City, California, is a highly regarded school for dyslexic students in grades two through eight. I got to know this school in the best way possible, that is, through consulting with the parents of dyslexic children, Natalie and Peter, who were students there. Since I knew both children before they enrolled at PCS, I was able to contrast their experiences at the two schools, including their abilities and their frequent disappointments and frustrations that led up to their enrollment at PCS. Full disclosure: I am now a trustee of PCS.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_334" title="334"/>Ironically, when I recently visited PCS to spend some time at the school before a board meeting, my visit coincided with a teacher-parent meeting to review Peter’s progress, which I was invited to join. His mother, Diana, had reached out to me several years before about her son’s lack of progress in reading: “I know he’s smart, but reading is something else again.” She was worried about placing Peter in a special school for all the reasons I’ve discussed. Reviewing his history and current assessment, I felt that attending PCS would be beneficial. Diana very tentatively agreed, but not without concern. Three years later, Peter had grown so much in every sense: reading, self-confidence, maturity. A worried mother has become an overjoyed parent, bursting with pride at her son’s accomplishments. One of the reasons I enjoy visiting PCS is the climate. Observing the classes, seeing the students interact with one another, and observing the teachers and students working together, I was impressed with the positive school climate for dyslexic children. At this meeting I could see how climate makes such a difference.</p>
			<p class="indent">As often happens, a special teacher made all the difference. It was readily apparent that Peter’s special reading teacher, Chris, had come to know Peter at a deep level, going to great lengths to find just the right books to interest him and motivate him to read. Not limited to one specific reading program, she had a toolbox of reading instruction techniques into which she could reach for the specific approach that would meet Peter’s needs. She was what we hope all reading instructors can be: a true, reliable diagnostician. Chris saw the whole Peter, not just a struggling reader. Her goal was not only to bring reading to Peter but to bring Peter to reading—that is, to foster his desire to read and, eventually, his love of reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">Peter was captivated by stories about the Knights of the Round Table, so Chris focused on this topic for special projects. Satisfying this interest helped motivate Peter in his other subjects as well, including math. Remarkably, when a friend asked him about his favorite subject, Peter’s reply was “Reading—I love to read.” “Can you imagine this from my dyslexic son?” his mother said. “Oh what a long way we have come. Now I know he has a real future, and what a great one at that.” Peter is now attending a public high school, where he continues to do very well academically and socially.</p>
			<p class="indent">PCS cares deeply and constantly pushes forward to ensure that each dyslexic student there is receiving the specific instruction needed. In its head, Judith Fuller, the school is led by an individual who has the compassion, knowledge, and commitment to dyslexic students to make a positive difference. Her experience includes being a kindergarten teacher in Los Angeles <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_335" title="335"/>public schools. She also worked assessing students and teaching their teachers how to use needed reading interventions, along the way obtaining a master’s degree in reading at UCLA.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fuller has been at PCS for twenty-six years in a full range of roles, so she is able to address any issue that may arise from multiple perspectives. She began as a fifth-grade teacher, then taught the youngest PCS students (second grade). She moved on to a role as reading teacher and then admissions director prior to assuming the role of school head. Coinciding with her transition to Park Century, she learned that her younger son, then in first grade, had been diagnosed as dyslexic. Here is her response to my question, “How did your experience as a mother of a dyslexic child influence what you do as an educator?”</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>It absolutely informs every single day of my life here, because there is not a story I hear from the parents that at some point in my life I haven’t lived. I think that people here who haven’t had that experience have a real sense of the care, but they don’t understand the anxiety and grief, because you’re grieving at the time when you are trying to figure things out and support your child and you’re sending them into the battlegrounds every day to do battle at school without all the skills they need. It’s a tremendous amount of anxiety and grief is all I can see, which you need to process at different times, at different points in their journey. And I think I recognize that in our parents. I try to share my experience and try to give them reassuring messages and then listen. They need to be heard.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What do you think people most misunderstand about dyslexia?” Fuller let out an exasperated sigh as she replied.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>That there’s a quick fix—just teach them to read. It truly involves so much more. Even if they become an accomplished reader, they won’t read as quickly as some of their peers and will need extra time. They may have incredible ideas and be able to dictate a marvelous story, but sometimes the details and the word recall will impact them later on when they’re very accomplished. So you can teach them to read, but there’re still other persisting issues and you really need to know compensatory strategies. It’s a lot more complicated than just teaching a child to read.</p>
				<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_336" title="336"/>I am so upset about schools not identifying early and telling parents they are getting “the gift of time” for these little, young children who are suffering daily. These educators seem to forget that in the early years school is about learning to read and that’s exactly what the children find so hard, and yet these students are not provided with appropriate instruction. And the area they are strong in, which is content, comes in the later grades, after their self-esteem has suffered such a hit that they no longer feel capable of learning. So for me, early identification, early intervention, is the key to success and the key to turning around an entire generation of children at-risk. My goal is to get the kids in earlier and have a turnaround for those kids in the lower grades, because if you catch them before they fall, they will succeed. But if you wait, as so many schools do, until they’re in fourth and fifth grade and they have so many emotional difficulties to overcome outside of the learning issues, it’s a big problem. So you can understand why my reading goals and my social-emotional goals go hand in hand. You can’t have one without the other, because nobody is available to learn if they feel less than [someone else] or stupid. Unfortunately, most of the kids come to us in third and fourth grades, fifth grade, sixth grade, and so we have to work on supporting their emotions and reducing their anxiety before we can even start intervention, because they’re not available to learn yet.</p>
				<p class="indent">We dedicate the first month of school to anxiety reduction before we even start ramping up instruction. There’s a whole period of time that goes into anxiety reduction and trust-building; then we begin instruction. And when we do instruction, we acknowledge that every child is different, and they have different availabilities to learn and progress, and they kind of grow like little helixes. They’ll have a burst in one area, and then you have to go and spiral back and support another area. It’s just not rocket science.</p>
				<p class="indent">What makes the biggest difference to kids at Park Century and helps them have confidence? There are a couple of things. One, when they start to talk with one another about how they’re smart but learn differently. Also, not feeling alone, not feeling different, learning the self-advocacy piece, and then having work at their level that they can master and feel accomplished.</p>
				<p class="indent">Park Century is structured to maximize learning opportunities. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_337" title="337"/>For example, the classes are small: The whole group class has twelve to thirteen students with a teacher and an associate teacher. The instructional groups for reading and math vary but are often one-to-three or even one-to-one.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">In speaking to Fuller, I recalled visiting an eighth-grade classroom at PCS years earlier and being very impressed with the students making videos of the brain. I wondered if this course was still taking place.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					We started having them in eighth grade study the brain, study how the brain works, study how <i>their brain</i> works, and then make a video about how they learn, what their strengths are, what their weaknesses are, what accommodations they need, and then we have them dissect a sheep brain. And then they write their own neuropsych report on how they learn, and it really helps the students to understand themselves, what they need to do to manage and be successful.</p>
				<p class="indent">No matter how long I see kids, when I have that opportunity to be with them in the beginning, when they come in and they’re scared and shut down and anxious, to then see them be able to stand up in front of a group of people and say, “I have dyslexia and I have ADHD and I need extra time and to sit in the front and I’ll be fine.” Yes, and what is so wonderful, to do so without shame. That’s the big thing.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">PCS works hard to ensure its students a well-rounded experience. For example, starting in fifth grade, students have the option of joining sports teams, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, and flag football, that play in a non-LD league. The school has a rigorous monthly community service called Panther Packs, which is considered to be character education involving kindness, respect, empathy, and resiliency. One of these traits is selected and talked about, and then a service is selected to help others. For example, the school recently held a bake sale to support victims of the extensive recent fires experienced by so many in California.</p>
			<p class="indent">Judith Fuller concludes:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I have to say that no one intervention is always perfect. There’s still for us a feeling that it’s trial-and-error, and we’re always trying to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_338" title="338"/>get better. We have staffings, where every two to three weeks the entire instructional team meets and we talk about how our students are responding. Are they still motivated? Are they shutting down? Are they anxious? Are they stalled out? What do we need to do to support them? I would say the gift of PCS is that we’re always willing to evaluate and always look at if we are providing everything a student needs to reach their uncommonly bright potential.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">School officials emphasize that a student at their school will have just as much of a social life as at an independent school, if not more, because he is not anxious, he feels comfortable with who he is, and he’s around people who are very much like himself. The experience is much more normalized.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>FORMING A BRIDGE</b></h2>
			<p>
				At specialized schools, uniquely, teachers speak to one another about their shared students. There is <i>a bridge, a unified curriculum, joining a student’s reading teacher with his other teachers.</i> Rather than each teacher and class being isolated in a silo, there is ongoing monitoring and an exchange of information among each child’s instructors, resulting in updates according to each student’s specific needs. <i>Students are grouped in their classes (such as social studies, biology) according to their reading levels.</i> Instruction is therefore customized. If, for example, a student in middle school continues to require reading instruction, this is just added on and does not take the place of a content class.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>It is vital to keep moving forward—the perfect is the enemy of the good.</i> I have been dismayed to witness far too many times the tendency to seek perfection before going forward. As many knowledgeable educators emphasize, it’s important to be aggressive in moving forward, far better than having a student working at a low level because of fear of progressing. The teacher can always back off if the approach is too aggressive. For example, in learning about the rules for pronunciation, if a student has not quite mastered a final e, that’s okay. Teachers can start overlapping the next level of instruction and move on. I once observed a one-on-one tutorial situation in Connecticut during which an incredibly bright young boy appeared to be tortured by continuous repetition he couldn’t quite manage. <i>Oh my,</i> I thought, <i>he would be so much better off moving forward to the next step while occasionally reviewing this material.</i></p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_339" title="339"/><b>SUMMING UP: NEXT STEPS</b></h2>
			<p>In truth there is no one perfect school environment that will suit every child who is dyslexic and his or her family. The key in selecting a school is determining which school’s profile best matches your and your child’s priorities at a particular point in time. Your priorities will change as a child goes on in school. In grade one your priority may be for your child to learn to read; later on, when the child is in grade nine, the provision of accommodations such as extra time on exams and participation in a team sport may be most critical.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you have determined your priorities, it is important that you know not only about each type of school but about the specific schools you are considering. To help you collect and organize the relevant information, I have provided a list of steps to take and a checklist of questions to ask about each school under consideration. (Clearly, not every parent has to ask every question; you must choose the questions that are important to you and your child.) By reading through these questions, you may learn about the range of possible programs and services that a school could potentially offer to your child.</p>

			<p class="indent">As important as it is to ask the questions you want to ask and to take in all the information you can, you must also value your gut feeling. Your overall impression of the school is important and may provide a clue about intangibles that are difficult to characterize but may be extremely meaningful to you and to your child. Schools can look very good on paper but somehow not have the parts come together in a satisfactory way. Just because you can’t easily put your gut feeling into words, do not dismiss it. Trust your instincts.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>SPECIALIZED SCHOOLS THROUGH THE EYES OF A RENOWNED DYSLEXIC SCIENTIST</b></h2>
			<p>You have been introduced to specialized schools through the eyes of school heads. Seeing a school through the eyes of an insightful dyslexic adult, one of the most revered scientists of our time, provides an additional, personal, yet highly applicable perspective. George Church, known for pioneering research in genetics and a dyslexic, reflects on what school was like for him and what he wishes for dyslexic children today.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_344" title="344"/>It is important to get their child into a place where their differences are embraced rather than being a source of embarrassment. Sometimes the source of embarrassment is not people literally bullying them; it is more people trying to be almost too nice, and the child can see that they are treating him differently. Kids are so sensitive to being different.</p>
				<p class="indent">I remember when I was growing up I must have spent huge portions of my thinking time trying to be the same as everybody else. I was constantly struggling to blend in. It wasn’t at all natural. And so if you can get your kid into some environment where being the same isn’t the be-all and end-all, that’s a win. Remember, at certain critical ages, if you are not wearing the same shirt and talking the same way as everyone else, you sense the difference.</p>
				<p class="indent">Either they make fun of you or they might try to be too nice to you—that makes it worse. And you almost can’t win. One of the most interesting experiences I had was a day I spent at a specialized school for dyslexic students. I spent a couple hours with the fifth-graders to the twelfth-graders and their parents. I was just amazed that when I would walk into the room, there were all these questions and engagement and real enthusiasm.</p>
				<p class="indent">And then I went to my old high school, and it took me half the time that I had with them to get them to open their mouths. And I’m thinking it’s because the high school that I went to was an elite school called Andover, where the Bushes went. I think the kids felt like they had more to lose than to win by opening their mouths. If they opened their mouths they might say something stupid. But at the specialized school it seemed like the attitude was part of the culture—you have nothing to lose. They would ask questions—it was quite dramatic.</p>
				<p class="indent">There really is something special about a specialized school. Everyone there is special, everyone there felt it was them, the school against the rest of the world. While in most schools, it’s you against everybody else at school.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">I asked Church, “If you had a wish about dyslexia, what would that wish be?” His response: “If you have a safe haven for them where it felt like the child with dyslexia was joining the X-Men from Marvel Comics rather than being special, that would be better.” Church explained further:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_345" title="345"/>If you just had a school that embraces dyslexia as a feature rather than a bug, it would be great. I know it’s tough on parents when you have a long commute. But I think it’s even tougher on the child when he is in a special class within a school. You know, that’s worse.</p>
				<p class="indent">I think having separate schools is better. Because when you’re in a class within a school, you’re still with the other kids for the lunches and the phys ed and various other things. And you feel different—yeah, I guess you don’t want to be in that special class. You want to do everything you can to get into the regular classes. And the kids and their families usually do everything they can not to be classified.</p>
				<p class="indent">I certainly did. I was willing to say I’m a slow reader, but I didn’t want to be classified. I didn’t want to be different. From about age, I’d say, eight to seventeen, you’re just petrified that somebody is singling you out. In fact, you watch what they are doing with the ones they do single out and you say, <i>That’s not for me.</i></p>
				<p class="indent">It wasn’t pleasant, and I said I don’t want to be that kid. And whenever they see one of these kids being picked on, they then generalize to themselves. And they say, <i>Well, I’m not quite as bad as that kid, but I can’t let them see that’s who I am. Just a second from now, that could be me.</i> I lived it. I mean when I’m looking at something from the outside. But I just felt so helpless I couldn’t help them. I couldn’t help myself; all I could do is try to blend in.</p>

			<p class="indent">I mentioned to the distinguished scientist that if he minded being quoted, I would not do so directly. His response: “I’m no longer embarrassed.” I couldn’t help but observe, “You think very differently, and you do an incredible amount of things and do them well.” Church’s response:</p>

				<p>I’m not afraid of thinking differently at this point. When I was—even at the worst time I was afraid of working differently. But I wasn’t afraid of thinking differently. Except I just had to be very cautious not to say what I was thinking. But today I can feel more comfortable saying what I am thinking.</p>

			<p class="indent">I commented to Church that I think one of the problems with dyslexia is, in a sense, that because you do not appear different, people don’t notice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_346" title="346"/>anything about you. But then when you don’t read well—you read slowly, which is most often the case—people assume, <i>Oh, slow reader, slow thinker.</i> Church’s response:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Especially reading out loud. That’s a real disaster. It is all the baggage that comes along with it. Kids at those ages are very, very sensitive. They have almost nothing else in their life other than determining who or what is different and who the cool kids are. That’s what they do. That’s their lesson, that’s their job. And these are the kids that know that they are not the cool kids and are spending a huge part of their time trying to justify their existence or become cool or hide or use various coping mechanisms, but it is not fun.</p>

			<p class="indent">This sentiment is from a man who, in terms of fame, scientific contributions, bridging and integrating multiple disciplines, is honored and universally admired and yet still carries with him the wounds he suffered as a child and deeply strives to alert parents how to avoid such painful experiences for their dyslexic child.</p>
