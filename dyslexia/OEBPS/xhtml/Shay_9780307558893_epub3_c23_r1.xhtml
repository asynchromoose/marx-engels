			<p>For any parent, choosing the right school for his or her child is a top priority. This is even more so when a son or daughter is dyslexic. One distressed parent raced up to me at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, sobbing, “Dr. Shaywitz, Dr. Shaywitz, please help me. I just learned that my son, Aiden, is dyslexic. What should I do? I don’t even know where to begin.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Having spoken with and problem-solved with scores of parents, I’ve found that concerns about schooling are often paramount. Will attending a regular school, public or private, keep a child in the mainstream, where she will be offered the same opportunities, classes, and circle of friends as her peers? Will she be seen as just another student, part of the group? Or will attending a public or independent school be too much for her? Will she find herself unable to keep pace, continually overwhelmed, losing confidence in herself? Will she come to see herself as a failure and become, whether in reality or in her own perception, an outsider and not part of the mainstream group? Conversely, if she attends a special school for children who are dyslexic, will she somehow feel lesser, different, or marginalized? Will she be missing out on something, either academic or social, and feel coddled or not part of the group, either way limiting her future opportunities? Will this choice take her off the mainstream road to success and cost her a fulfilling future? Or will <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_314" title="314"/>attending a special school provide her with the reading and other academic skills and self-awareness to facilitate her academic progress and solidify her self-concept, allowing her to move forward to realize her potential? Will being with and interacting with other students who are dyslexic show her that they are no less intelligent than nondyslexics and actually creative and fun to be with? These are difficult questions, with different answers for each child, and at varying times in her development they need to be reassessed. Let’s explore the options.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE MOST CRITICAL ELEMENT: CLIMATE—HIDDEN BUT EVERYWHERE</b></h2>
			<p>
				In the years since <i>Overcoming Dyslexia</i> was first published, I have been a dyslexia detective, working constantly to learn more about what really counts, including what makes the most difference in the school a dyslexic child attends. Reading program, overall curriculum, and availability of the arts and sports are important. But having visited endless schools, for the better part of a day sitting in on a range of classes, speaking to parents, meeting with educators and school administrators, and getting to know many, many dyslexic boys and girls, I came to realize that these features, as important as they are, are only parts of a much deeper and I think critical aspect of a child’s experience.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Climate.</i> The most critical element in a school a dyslexic child attends is the <i>climate.</i> It permeates every classroom, the auditorium, the cafeteria, the playing fields, and, most especially, virtually every interaction between your child and his teachers and peers. Climate is truly at the heart of the school experience for dyslexic children. Other components certainly influence the child’s day-to-day experience, but the climate supersedes all else in impacting your child’s future, how she views herself as a learner, her self-esteem, and her sense of empowerment. Does she see herself as a worthy person who is bright and can succeed or as someone who always has to be on the lookout for a misstep? If she makes an error, is there someone at the ready to point a finger and pounce on her as if to send the message <i>See, you’re really not up to par</i>—<i>you’re a damaged person?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">If a dyslexic child attends a school that does not “believe in dyslexia,” or even if the school pays lip service to providing a reasonably good reading program or accommodations and the climate is not truly welcoming, that child will suffer.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_315" title="315"/>As you know by now, when a dyslexic child is called upon to answer a question, she will on occasion (no matter how well she knows the answer) blurt out a word that sounds similar but is incorrect (such as “<i>confession</i> stand” rather than “<i>concession</i> stand”). At such times, will an ill-prepared teacher who knows frightfully little about dyslexia stare at her in dismay while her classmates smirk or giggle? Or alternatively, will her teacher, who understands dyslexia, smile and provide her with a choice—“oh, Eva, did you mean <i>concession</i> stand or <i>confession</i> stand?”—thus providing an opportunity for the child to hear, recognize, and verbalize the correct response? In this case Eva will have an opportunity to respond again, choosing the correct word, and then sit down feeling much better about herself. In a school where the climate is right, where knowledge of dyslexia is required, teachers will know that Eva, as a child who is dyslexic, may know the correct response but will often be unable to retrieve the correct word.</p>
			<p class="indent">A school without a full understanding of dyslexia is not a school for your child. Things are bound to go wrong. For example, Mimi is a wonderful, hardworking, and bright middle-schooler who is dyslexic. Her school decided that she had to ask for extra time before each and every test. Of course, in granting Mimi this accommodation, the school acknowledged that she required that time to be able to show her knowledge. But why should she have to ask for it each time? That does not represent a good climate. Not surprisingly, for one exam Mimi was so nervous that she neglected to make the request. Not only was she not allowed the extra time the school knew was necessary for her, but her school went on to count the grade on this test, which she was predictably unable to finish. That is not the kind of school you want your dyslexic child to attend.</p>
			<p class="indent">In Connecticut the requirement for consideration in the gifted and talented program in at least one Fairfield County community required a student to be two years above his grade level in reading. Disregarding that dyslexia is defined as an “unexpected difficulty in reading in relation to a person’s intelligence,” this ignorant rule assured that bright dyslexic students would be ineligible for placement in the program. Similarly, some schools make the false assumption that if you read slowly you must also think slowly and do not allow dyslexic students access to higher-level math and science courses. A student named David was as brilliant and eager a student as I have ever met, and yet his school would not even consider that he should be allowed to take AP math or AP chemistry courses.</p>
			<p class="indent">One of the most egregious cases of confusion of slow reading with slow thinking occurred at a top-rated college, where a dyslexic student, Leo, had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_316" title="316"/>been approved for extra time on exams as an accommodation for his slow reading. He was very pleased with that and told his professor so. In response, the professor began speaking to Leo very, very slowly, as if Leo could not process the spoken words at a normal rate. The professor’s assumption was that if Leo was a slow reader, he must also be a slow thinker. Not surprisingly, Leo was devastated by his professor’s profound lack of understanding of dyslexia.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Considerations.</i> Most parents I know prefer to have their child attend the local public school, but the typical public school, including its special education program, does little to move a dyslexic child forward. You must always keep in mind that the availability of special education is by itself no guarantee that a child is receiving an appropriate education. In general, public schools are slow or fail to identify dyslexia, provide too little instruction, and often use unproven and incomplete programs taught by teachers who know little about teaching reading. Most egregious and harmful to their students who may be dyslexic is that typically neither the administrators nor the classroom teachers have any real sense of dyslexia—a condition affecting at least 20 percent of their students!</p>
			<p class="indent">Still, there is something to be said for having a child remain in his local school. Public schools generally offer much more diversity than can be found in a private school setting. This diversity extends to the composition of the student body, to the possibilities for choice within the curriculum, and to the opportunities for participation in important nonacademic activities such as sports, music, and art. Public schools are also free. So it’s important to know that public schools can be made receptive to new ideas—they can change. Parents and teachers can use the information in this book, together with the Report of the National Reading Panel and the What Works Clearinghouse to bring evidence-based reading instruction to every child’s classroom. The information and data are available and are beginning to be more widespread. Awareness is growing along with the hope that such interventions will soon become a widespread reality for dyslexic readers, that teachers will come to expect success from their dyslexic students and children will benefit enormously. Joining visionary educators in this forward-looking movement are parents who, frustrated by their experiences advocating for their child and fueled by their love for their child, have banded together to form groups such as Decoding Dyslexia, a national confederation of state groups advocating for children who are dyslexic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_317" title="317"/>Parents must always be vigilant to ensure that their child is receiving the most effective reading instruction, that it is evidence-based and integrated with his other academic subjects, and that their child’s strengths are not overlooked.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THINKING ABOUT CHANGING SCHOOLS</b></h2>
			<p>In some instances it is in the best interests of a child to change schools. Serious consideration should be given to changing schools if you have tried a public school setting and</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">Selecting that new school represents a critical juncture for parents. Jack and Inez Johnson were at this point when they came to see me. Their son, Eddie, was the spitting image of his large, bearlike, ruddy-faced father. Eddie had begun his schooling in a private day school in a suburb of New York City. As is so often the case, Jack and Inez had complex reasons for sending Eddie to a private school. On the surface it seemed obvious that this was <i>the</i> school to go to if you were smart and your parents could afford it. His father longed to give Eddie the kind of early education he never had.</p>
			<p class="indent">Jack, the managing partner of a large law firm, knew what it was like to have reading problems. As a child and into the present, reading was and is a struggle for him. At first Jack rejoiced in Eddie’s advanced vocabulary and quickness at grasping new ideas and concepts—his general brightness in the preschool years—so he enrolled him in this much-desired school. Once there, Eddie was not the academic star his parents imagined he might be. Perhaps it was just a period of adjustment, they thought. He’s a boy, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_318" title="318"/>and boys may be slow to adjust. Knowing deep down what they could not outwardly admit to themselves, they set about creating a safety net for their son. They hired a tutor. Eddie went to school from eight to four; then after dinner he worked with his tutor or with one of his parents. The days were very long, and it was a losing battle: Eddie was in free fall, heading for the bottom of his class. The school itself was tone deaf to his needs. “He must buckle down and work harder,” the headmistress told Eddie’s parents. At age ten Eddie was seriously dyslexic. He was daily facing what seemed to him to be an avalanche of new words—long, complicated, multisyllabic words. He could no longer get by just with memorization. The only saving grace was that Eddie was a star soccer player.</p>
			<p class="indent">Worn down by their nightly homework sessions with Eddie and concerned about his increasingly gloomy persona, Jack and Inez came to the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity. After discussing Eddie’s evaluation and his needs for specialized reading instruction, understanding the impact of dyslexia and the importance of support, we talked about school options: special education in a public school, another independent day school, or a school specializing in educating children with dyslexia. We talked about the benefits and costs associated with each type of school.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many parents turn to independent day schools because they find the local public schools wanting. Private schools offer smaller classes and potentially more opportunity for individualization. Discipline tends to be firmer, and the students often have a greater chance of going on to a competitive college. Of course, like public schools, independent day schools vary in quality. At their very best, such schools can provide a constructive refuge for a child like Eddie. If the administration and faculty are willing, a small private school can provide the bricks and mortar of an effective program for improving reading. Relative smallness can bring with it both flexibility in modifying the rest of the child’s academic program and also a sense of intimacy in getting to know the student and in providing him with a supportive network of encouragement that extends throughout the school.</p>
			<p class="indent">For most children, the options for private schooling are more likely to be country day schools or boarding schools. More often than not, these schools turn out to be a disaster for a child with dyslexia. In contrast to most public school settings, I have found that children in private schools are more likely to be in lockstep with one another. Such schools may often pride themselves on uniformity, which often extends to the curriculum and to reading instruction. For some of these schools, maintaining decades, if not centuries, of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_319" title="319"/>tradition trumps the desire for change and indeed of moving forward. The lack of student diversity in this setting most often does not serve the interests of a student with dyslexia; the opportunities for innovation, for providing different courses, and for creating special programs are limited.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, there are private schools with quality reading programs and understanding of the needs of their students who are dyslexic. It is your job to assess the climate of the school overall and in each of its programs before enrolling your child. Moreover, if your child has already been identified as having dyslexia, or if you suspect dyslexia, proper testing and evaluation should be conducted before you approach any school. A diagnosis of dyslexia pinpoints the specific nature of the problem, which in turn leads to a much deeper understanding of your child and better equips you to ask the right questions and find the best school.</p>
			<p class="indent">For the parent of a child who is dyslexic, enrolling him at an independent school often represents the belief that he will get more attention and a better education there than is possible in a public setting. But be aware that attendance at an independent school may evade the real issue: acceptance that your child is in any way different from the idealized American boy or girl. Many parents worry that if their son or daughter attends a special school for children with dyslexia, he or she will be removed from the mainstream of society and will not be able to participate in it fully. Society often tends to view people with disabilities not only as different but as lesser individuals, in this case often incorrectly confusing dyslexia with mental slowness or intellectual disability.</p>
			<p class="indent">Parents like the Johnsons can be torn. Jack, having suffered both in school and in life from poor reading relative to his intellectual strengths, now wanted his son to have a better education, to be a reader. He was in favor of sending Eddie to a nearby specialized school for children with dyslexia. On the other hand, the thought of Eddie attending some special school for dyslexic children frightened Inez. “Let him stay one more year at the school he’s in,” she pleaded with her husband. “We’ll work harder, get a better tutor. It will work out.” She worried that the children at a school catering to dyslexics would not be as bright or as sweet as Eddie. Going to a special school might mean giving up soccer, from which he gained so much positive feedback, surrounded by friends. He was so bright, she thought; surely reading would come. Jack, based on his own experience, believed that going to a special school would help Eddie develop a more positive view of himself. Inez believed that if her son were to attend such a school, his sense of self <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_320" title="320"/>would be diminished; he would view himself as somehow defective. Inez did not take into consideration that most specialized schools only go through the eighth grade, meaning that Eddie would have to go to a regular school for ninth grade and that attending a specialized school might allow him to go forward with stronger academic skills and a higher level of self-esteem.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Johnsons made many inquiries, followed by visits to several schools in their area. They wavered and vacillated; they wanted so much to do what was best for Eddie. Finally Eddie’s parents settled on their priorities. The school should be within commuting distance; have a mixed student population rather than one focused entirely on dyslexia; offer a strong sports program, one in which their son could participate in interscholastic matches; and already have in place, or at least be willing to create, a comprehensive educational program with an evidence-based reading intervention at its core.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Johnsons chose a setting that would emphasize Eddie’s strengths—socialization with a nondisabled peer group and active participation in team sports—rather than his differences. They found a school that was primarily for typical learners but was willing to accept a child who had dyslexia. The school’s reading program was earnest and had several components often found in evidence-based interventions. However, it was not clear if these parts would be sufficient to provide Eddie with the explicitness, practice, and intensity he required in order to become a skilled reader. As the school year evolved, it would be important to keep a sharp eye out to see if the school’s overall climate was truly supportive. The goal was for Eddie not only to progress academically but to develop a positive self-image, allowing him to leave the school feeling good about himself.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THINKING ABOUT A SPECIALIZED SCHOOL</b></h2>
			<p>
				Like all schools, specialized schools for boys and girls who are dyslexic vary in the quality of their instruction and in the makeup of their student body. Quite a number of highly accomplished college students spent part of their formative years at schools for children with dyslexia (in most instances from two to four years). My impression is that students with dyslexia who attend such schools are more likely to have an overall positive outcome than students who attend a traditional independent school. Schools of this type exist across the country. A list of them can be found on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c23_r1.xhtml#page_325">this page</a>. I have observed classes or met with faculty and students at many of these schools. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_321" title="321"/>Each time I visit, I come away wishing that each dyslexic boy and girl were able to experience the benefits of such a school. Although not every child succeeds totally, each child leaves with his or her dignity intact and a sense of competence.</p>
			<p class="indent">These schools are so special because all the children there, at each grade level, require some degree of help in reading, <i>which ensures that educational need serves as the central focus of the school’s instructional program rather than being incidental or peripheral to it.</i> There is no need to negotiate or to argue for the proper reading instruction; students receive highly effective reading instruction provided with sufficient intensity and over the necessary duration. Teachers are highly experienced and share a sense of camaraderie. The expectation is for success. Faculty members are encouraged to keep abreast of new developments in the teaching of reading. Instruction is optimized: Children are taught in small groups, reading and other language-related skills occupy a significant segment of the day, classes are coordinated around a specific theme or a child’s needs. Each child’s reading needs and his academic curriculum are fully integrated: Reading is related to writing; writing is related to what the child is learning in literature or social studies. The science curriculum is not watered down, but difficult-to-pronounce words are reviewed before pages are assigned for reading. No child needs to fear that when he is called on, the class will laugh when he stumbles over pronouncing words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although many parents, like Inez Johnson, shy away from such schools because they are fearful of the effects on their child’s self-esteem, the result is often just the reverse. In fact, I believe that, even more than improvements in reading, the most important long-term benefit of being a student at such a school may well be its positive influence on a child’s self-esteem. As I’ve emphasized, building self-esteem is essential for later success. Attending a school where you are not one of the very few who have been identified as dyslexic but instead are in the majority represents a very different kind of experience. You can relax. You no longer need to hide your dyslexia. Such students also meet bright people like themselves. It is akin to looking in the mirror and liking what you see. Students find others who share their experiences and concerns. They also learn that they do not have to like all people who have dyslexia; like everyone else, such individuals run the full gamut of personalities and traits. Because these students are in a supportive environment, they can learn about and practice the self-advocacy skills they will need when they are in other settings.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_322" title="322"/>Without the pressures often found at other schools, children at these schools have the opportunity to grow and to discover who they are. They develop an awareness of the full range of their skills, their strengths as well as their weaknesses. For example, at the Windward School in White Plains, New York, and in New York City, students attend a course that helps them develop insights into their own characteristics as learners. At the Park Century School in Culver City, California, each graduating (eighth-grade) student creates a video document demonstrating his understanding of the basis of his reading difficulties. Contrary to the view that enrollment at a special school is a sign of defeat, attendance at such a school may be the initial step in a student’s pathway to success. One of the first dyslexic students I encountered at Yale, Kayla, whom you met earlier, had attended a school specialized for students with dyslexia. After graduating from Yale, Kayla went on to fulfill her long-held dream of a career as a screenwriter. Typically, as I said, children spend two to four years at such a school and then return either to their local public school or to a nonspecialized independent school. Explicit plans are made to help ensure that the child makes a successful transition.</p>

				<h3 class="head"><b>A VERY PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM A PARENT</b></h3>
				<p class="spaceabove left">Dear Dr. Shaywitz,</p>
				<p class="indent left">I’m writing to you to let you know how much you changed my son’s life—and my life—for the better.</p>
				<p class="indent left">I went to a talk you gave in California. At that point, I was wrestling with what to do: keep [my dyslexic son, Levi] at our mainstream public school, or send him to a special school to address his reading head-on.</p>
				<p class="indent left">Dr. Shaywitz, you were laserlike in your immediate response: “Time is your son’s most precious resource. This is a top priority for your son.” You didn’t mince words, and I was—and am, to this day—profoundly grateful. Your message was what I needed to hear. That same day, I shared with my husband your call to action. Thankfully, your research, and your honest, highly informed clarion call, made the case for my husband as well. Life presents unexpected challenges, and I am so grateful that you unequivocally pointed us in the right direction, at a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_323" title="323"/>time when we—and our son—most needed your expertise and guidance.</p>
				<p class="indent left">Our son went to a specialized school for first through fourth grade, where every day he practiced learning to break down words together with reading these words in connected text. Every day he learned he was not alone in this challenge, a challenge that with meaningful, intensive, and frequent practice he could overcome. He not only learned reading skills, he also learned perseverance. Even at that young age he dug in deep and never gave up, because, thanks in great part to you, he had adults around him who understood his learning needs—and took action. He learned the value of hard work, the intrinsic satisfaction of giving his all to learning.</p>
				<p class="indent left">After four years of step-by-step, explicit reading instruction, Levi successfully returned to our public school for fifth grade. That same fall, his younger sister started first grade. Our daughter was a typical learner, so the mainstream first-grade curriculum was an easy, comfortable fit. Seeing what she and many classmates could do in first grade made me realize how much a typical first-grade classroom would have been nothing less than a total nightmare for our son. He would likely have paid a high emotional price along the way, feeling like a failure surrounded by many kids experiencing reading success. I don’t think Levi ever felt like a failure, thanks to your sound advice. Instead he got to use his precious time learning the things he needed to learn, so that he could thrive in the classroom, and in life.</p>
				<p class="indent left">For Levi, the process of overcoming dyslexia has not been a quick fix. Levi continued to have a tutor, twice a week, from fifth grade through ninth grade, and through it all, he has had to put in countless hours of effort. Through it all, Levi has never given less than 110 percent. I am beyond proud of him, and again, so grateful to you.</p>
				<p class="indent left">A couple of months ago, when my cell phone rang, it was my son, Levi. “Mom, I just got my SAT scores. I got a 650 in math, a 750 in writing, and Mom, I got a 780 in reading.” I can’t put into words the intense, overwhelming emotions of that moment. I started to cry. I was just so proud of him, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_324" title="324"/>and so happy for him. We are more grateful than you’ll ever know!</p>
				<p class="indent left spaceabove">Take good care,</p>
				<p class="indent left">A grateful mom</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>SUMMING UP: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHOICE OF SCHOOL</b></h2>
			<p><i>Public Schools.</i> Public schools allow a child to interact with a diverse group of children and to participate in a range of local activities. They are convenient and free. On the downside, there is scant evidence that most current special education reading programs in public schools benefit a child who is dyslexic. Does the school use the word <i>dyslexia</i> and understand the impact of dyslexia? If your local school is willing to provide an evidence-based intervention (you can use Michele’s program on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c20_r1.xhtml#page_275">this page</a> as a guide) to integrate your child’s reading needs with the remainder of his academic subjects and to regularly monitor his reading pulse, it is certainly worth a try. As school systems and educators become aware of dyslexia and of evidence-based interventions, schools should be—hopefully, will be—increasing their receptivity to utilizing more effective reading programs. Six months (or a semester) represents a reasonable trial period; it is long enough to see positive results if they are going to occur and short enough not to inflict permanent harm on your child. Above all, if you are troubled by the results, don’t wait any longer. If you have the resources and your child is floundering, consider an alternative school.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Private Independent Schools.</i> If you have your heart set on sending your child to an independent day school, it is important that you learn about the school’s climate—that is, its attitude toward bright children who struggle to read. Explicitly ask the school how it addresses the needs of dyslexic children. Private schools generally do not offer specialized reading programs for such children and may not have the flexibility or knowledge to modify or adapt their courses. Such schools vary in their understanding and in the availability of accommodations. They may offer advanced science or computer courses for those students who have the interest and the ability. Extracurricular activities and social activities are often a strength.</p>

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_325" title="325"/><i>Specialized Schools for Children with Dyslexia.</i> For children struggling with dyslexia whose parents have the financial resources, a specialized school should be seriously considered. Specialized schools care deeply about children and frequently extend themselves to offer scholarships and financial aid packages to help assist families.</p>
			<p class="indent">I think these schools should be given consideration even for children with less severe dyslexia. These are the ones who fall through the cracks, who often struggle unnoticed and unassisted, and who could benefit from the enrichment of their reading skills and the building of self-esteem that a specialized school offers. Here is a list of recommended schools of this type:</p>
