			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>THE LAW IS ON YOUR SIDE</b></h1>
			<p>
				Since its first description over a century ago, dyslexia has been recognized as an <i>unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the ability to be a much better reader.</i> Unfortunately, in some circles the basic component of dyslexia—its <i>unexpected</i> nature—has been overlooked, including in its definition. Now its unexpected nature has finally been codified in the most up-to-date, scientifically validated definition of dyslexia in the recently passed First Step Act, which was signed into law as Public Law 115-391. Given its extraordinary importance and implications for those who are dyslexic, I am going to restate it here: “The term ‘dyslexia’ means an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader, most commonly caused by a difficulty in the phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell.” In addition, the law mandates a “Dyslexia Screening Program…a screening program for dyslexia that is (A) evidence-based with proven psychometrics for validity; (B) efficient and low-cost; and (C) readily available.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-190"/>This legal definition was preceded by Senate Resolution 680, which was passed by a unanimous and bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate in 2018. In addition to the definition included in the law, this seminal resolution emphasizes that dyslexia is a paradox, so that an individual with dyslexia may have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_467" title="467"/>both weaknesses in decoding that result in difficulties in accurate or fluent word recognition and strengths in higher-level cognitive functions such as reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, and problem-solving. The resolution also notes that “the achievement gap between typical readers and dyslexic readers occurs as early as first grade” and reemphasizes the critical importance of “early screening for, and early diagnosis of, dyslexia…for ensuring that individuals with dyslexia receive focused, evidence-based intervention that leads to fluent reading, promotion of self-awareness and self-empowerment, and the provision of necessary accommodations that ensure success in school and in life.”</p>
			<p class="indent">If passionate advocates for dyslexic individuals want them to benefit from scientific progress, we must join together to ensure that this wonderful progress is translated into action. We worry that people are fearful of change and of letting go of an out-of-date definition that has now been replaced by one reflecting new knowledge and a new level of understanding of dyslexia. This contemporary definition truly defines dyslexia, noting not only its unexpected nature but also the role of a phonological deficit; the incorporation of the Sea of Strengths model; its prevalence in relation to that of general learning disabilities and in the overall population; the critical role of early identification; the great importance of evidence-based interventions to support self-awareness and self-empowerment; and the role of accommodations to enable dyslexic students to look forward to happy and fulfilling lives. Because there is so much ignorance and confusion about exactly what dyslexia is, <span id="ftn-191"/>this up-to-date definition will allow parents, educators, and policymakers to better understand and educate boys and girls who are dyslexic. We have taken a major step forward in closing the action gap that so often surrounds dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">This up-to-date definition carries into action the plea made in my congressional testimony in September 2014 and to the <span id="ftn-192"/>Senate HELP Committee in May 2016, where I stated the necessary goal of bringing together twenty-first-century science and education and closing the action gap in translating scientific progress in dyslexia into policy and practice. This new law and resolution represent a win for every child (or adult) who is dyslexic, for his or her parents and community, and for our entire nation, but state laws still need addressing. Today over forty states have dyslexia laws, and these laws vary greatly. Some are not very accurate.</p>
			<p class="indent">To help you plan an effective implementation strategy for your child, your student, or yourself, it’s important first to review the three federal laws that affect dyslexic students.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_468" title="468"/>The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA), enacted in 1975 and then updated as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990 and updated again in 2004, is designed to ensure that grade-school and secondary-school students with a disability are provided a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE) tailored to their individual needs. One of the law’s pillars is that students with a disability are entitled to an individualized education program (IEP) that spells out the services to be provided. The law specifies fourteen categories to define students with a disability who should be guaranteed a free and appropriate public education. <span id="ftn-193"/>One of those fourteen is the category of “specific learning disability,” which includes dyslexia. Children require an IEP in order to receive special education services.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span id="ftn-194"/>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), first passed in 1990 and then amended in 2008 (the ADA Amendments Act, or ADAAA), prohibits discrimination based on a person’s disability. It is meant to level the playing field for people with disabilities, including those who are dyslexic. The ADAAA, discussed in detail below, is critical in ensuring that dyslexic students receive accommodations on high-stakes tests such as the SAT, ACT, and examinations for graduate and professional schools.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span id="ftn-195"/>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (commonly referred to as 504) is frequently applied in cases where students may not qualify for an IEP yet may require accommodations. While a 504 designation may provide your child with accommodations, it does not provide the extensive protections and services for children found eligible for an IEP under IDEA, including interventions for dyslexia.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">With this as a preface, let’s review some of the most important and relevant components of these laws directly applicable to protecting and supporting dyslexic students. Because of its direct relevance to obtaining educational services for children with dyslexia, we begin with one of the most important components of the IDEA, the IEP.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_469" title="469"/><b>THE IEP</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-196"/>The first step in the IEP (Individualized Education Program) process is determining whether the child meets the criteria for disability as defined under the IDEA. While procedures for determining eligibility differ in each state, the first step in the process is a referral. This typically is a written request for an evaluation to determine if the child qualifies as a child with a disability. The referral can be initiated by either her school or her parent and must be carried out within sixty days. Parents have the final decision on whether they agree to the referral or not. The evaluation is typically done by the school. If you believe the evaluation is not accurate, you have the right to request an independent evaluation. If you request this early enough in the process, the school may pay for this independent evaluation, though if there is a time constraint you may need to pay for this yourself. Make sure that the professional you select to perform the independent evaluation is someone who is comfortable using the word <i>dyslexia</i> and diagnosing dyslexia. Often this can be accomplished by asking the evaluator, “Do you diagnose dyslexia?” A negative or wavering response will tell you that this may be someone to avoid.</p>
			<p class="indent">In order for your child to demonstrate that she is eligible to receive services under IDEA, she must meet two requirements:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>She must have a disabling condition, dyslexia, which is included under specific learning disabilities.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>The impact of the condition (her dyslexia) must create a need for special education services.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Once it has been determined that she meets these requirements, the school district must convene a team to develop the child’s IEP.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>There are well-defined rules about when the team must be convened (within thirty days) and who will participate at that meeting:</p>
				<ul class="ul">
					<li>the parents of the child</li>
					<li>a regular education teacher</li>
					<li>a special education teacher</li>
					<li>a school administrator who can design the program, knows about the general education curriculum, and knows the availability of resources</li>
					<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_470" title="470"/>an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation</li>
					<li>sometimes the child, and, at the parents’ or school’s discretion, others who have knowledge or special expertise</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="list0 spaceabove"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span id="ftn-197"/>The law requires that the IEP must contain specific information:</p>
				<ul class="ul">
					<li>the child’s present levels of academic achievement and functional performance</li>
					<li>measurable annual goals</li>
					<li>an explanation of how the child’s progress toward meeting the annual goals will be measured</li>
					<li>special education and related services and supplementary aids and services that will be provided to the child</li>
					<li>an explanation of the extent to which the child will not participate with nondisabled children</li>
					<li>appropriate accommodations necessary to measure academic achievement and functional performance on statewide and districtwide assessments</li>
					<li>the beginning date for providing services and modifications</li>
					<li>a statement from the IEP team if it determines that the child must take an alternate assessment in place of the statewide and districtwide assessments</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">IDEA ensures that parents play a central role in the IEP process, beginning with the referral, continuing with evaluation, and then proceeding to the creation and implementation of the IEP. My strong recommendation is for you as your child’s advocate and champion to make sure you avail yourself of these legal safeguards and obtain the optimal services your child requires.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PRESERVING THE RIGHT TO ACCOMMODATIONS: THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 (ADAAA)</b></h2>
			<p>
				The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) is the most important federal law affecting your or your child’s ability to obtain accommodations, especially on high-stakes tests. My philosophy about overcoming <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_471" title="471"/>dyslexia is that <i>strength and victories come from the empowerment gained through knowledge.</i> Knowledge about the law and policy affecting the granting of accommodations is essential to that. There has been a cosmic shift in the law and the attitude of government agencies responsible for enforcing the law in favor of granting requests for accommodations to bright and academically high-performing dyslexic students. The more specifics you know, the more you will be able to forcefully advocate for your child or yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is important for you to be aware of what the law says, because it is often in conflict with what testing agencies claim. Over the years after the passage of the original Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, progressively restrictive judicial decisions posed a serious setback to all that had been achieved in gaining civil rights for the disabled, including those who were dyslexic. The dyslexic community owes a huge debt of gratitude to a group of especially caring and committed congressional representatives and senators who crafted the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008. The ADAAA made clear Congress’s intent in passing the law so that there would be no question when cases came before the courts as to what Congress had in mind.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF DYSLEXIC APPLICANTS TO OBTAIN ACCOMMODATIONS</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-198"/>In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice published an extremely important document that codifies the critical issues Congress sought to effect with the passage of the ADAAA: “The Final Regulatory Assessment, Final Rule—Amendment of ADA Title II and Title III Regulations to Implement ADA Amendments Act of 2008.” <span id="ftn-199"/>Here are its most important elements:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>In a change from previous regulations, dyslexia, and not learning disability, is considered the primary central entity. Throughout, the DOJ refers to <span id="ftn-200"/>“dyslexia and other learning disabilities.”</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>The term <i>disability</i> is to be <i>interpreted broadly.</i> The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations not to discriminate based on disability.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_472" title="472"/>Congress instructed that “the question of whether an individual’s impairment is a disability under the ADA <span id="ftn-201"/><i>should not demand extensive analysis</i>.” Specifically, comparison of an individual’s performance of a major life activity to that of most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical evidence.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Types of evidence that are less onerous to collect, such as statements or affidavits of affected individuals, school records, or determinations of disability status under other statutes, should in most cases be considered adequate to establish that an impairment is substantially limiting.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>The Final Rule emphasizes that Congress clearly intended the ADA Amendments Act to expand coverage: “It is our expectation that because this bill makes the definition of disability more generous, some people who were not covered before will now be covered.”</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>When considering requests for modifications, accommodations, or auxiliary aids or services, the entity should <i>give considerable weight to documentation of past modifications, accommodations, or auxiliary aids or services received in similar testing situations</i> or provided in response to an Individualized Education Program provided under the IDEA or a plan describing services provided under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (often referred to as a section 504 plan).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>The ADA as amended expressly prohibits any consideration of the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures when determining whether an individual’s impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Importantly, an example in the Final Rule illustrating dyslexia shows a <i>discrepancy</i> between the person’s age, measured intelligence, and education and that person’s actual versus expected achievement.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>One of the most important elements in the Final Rule is the concept of <i>condition, manner, or duration.</i> These terms are critical in interpretation of the rules of construction for “substantially limited.” Specifically, it is made clear that it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_473" title="473"/>could be useful to consider, in comparison to most people in the general population, the <i>conditions</i> under which an individual performs a major life activity; the <i>manner</i> in which an individual performs a major life activity; or the <i>time it takes</i> (duration) an individual to perform a major life activity.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>These three critical factors, <i>condition, manner,</i> and <i>duration,</i> provide significant support to bright dyslexics requesting accommodations. Giving deference to how a person reads is a major leap forward. The score a dyslexic obtains on a test does not reveal the extraordinary effort she must put forth to obtain that score—much more than most people who obtain the same score.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">The Final Rule notes that the language regarding the “<i>difficulty, effort,</i> or <i>time</i> required to perform a major life activity” should prove extremely helpful to dyslexic individuals asserting a need for testing accommodations.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>An individual with dyslexia may need to approach reading or writing in a distinct manner or under different conditions than most people in the general population, possibly employing aids including verbalizing, visualizing, decoding, or phonology, such that the effort required could support a determination that the individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of reading or writing.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">In passing the ADA Amendments Act, Congress clarified that courts had misinterpreted the ADA definition of <i>disability</i> by, among other things, inappropriately emphasizing the capabilities of people with disabilities to achieve certain outcomes. For example, someone with dyslexia may achieve a high level of academic success but may nevertheless be substantially limited in one or more of the major life activities of reading, writing, speaking, or learning because of the additional time or effort he must spend to read, speak, write, or learn compared to most people in the general population.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Final Rule notes that some courts have found that students who have reached a high level of academic achievement are not to be considered individuals with disabilities under the ADA, as such individuals may have difficulty demonstrating substantial limitation in the major life activities of learning or reading relative to “most people.” The Final Rule does not support such a view. It states:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_474" title="474"/>“When considering the <i>condition, manner, or duration</i> in which an individual with dyslexia performs a major life activity, <i>it is critical to <span class="underline">reject</span> the assumption that an individual who performs well academically or otherwise cannot be substantially limited in activities such as learning, reading, writing, thinking, or speaking.</i>” (italics added)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">The Final Rule quotes Congress that the comparison of individuals with dyslexia to “most people” requires a careful analysis of the method and manner in which an individual’s impairment limits a major life activity. For the majority of the population, the basic mechanics of reading and writing do not pose extraordinary lifelong challenges; rather, recognizing and forming letters and words are effortless, unconscious, automatic processes. The process of reading for an individual with dyslexia is word-by-word and otherwise cumbersome, painful, deliberate, and slow—throughout life.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>The Final Rule reflects congressional intent and makes clear that the <i>outcome</i> an individual with a disability is able to achieve <i>is not determinative of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity.</i> Instead, an individual can demonstrate the extent to which an impairment affects the condition, manner, or duration in which he performs a major life activity, such that it constitutes a substantial limitation. The ultimate outcome of an individual’s efforts should not undermine a claim of disability, even if that individual ultimately is able to achieve the same or similar result as someone without the impairment.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">The Final Rule emphasizes that the testing results or grades of an individual seeking reasonable modifications or testing accommodations may not be relevant to determinations of disability, in contrast to what testing agencies often claim.</p>
			<p class="indent">As we know, often standing between the dyslexic individual and the demonstration of her intelligence and deep knowledge is her slow reading. Once a dyslexic reader is allowed extra time to complete a test, she is able to demonstrate her high ability; without such an accommodation, the test merely becomes a reflection of her disability. Scores on such unaccommodated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_475" title="475"/>tests often do great harm to dyslexic students, preventing access to higher education and desired careers. Perhaps of most concern, those students are left with the incorrect perception that they are not intelligent.</p>
			<p class="indent">Judge Sonia Sotomayor understood the critical importance of extra time for a dyslexic reader. Hearing the case of Marilyn Bartlett, a dyslexic lawyer seeking accommodations on the bar examination, Judge (now Supreme Court Justice) Sotomayor found for the dyslexic lawyer, wisely opining: “Just as a person in a wheelchair can use an above-ground entrance to gain access to a building if a ramp is available, a dyslexic can draw meaning from complex text if permitted the time required to slowly decipher each word manually. To a dyslexic, time is his ramp.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>New York Times</i> reporter Jim Dwyer described the interchange between the judge and the plaintiff:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>The woman sitting in the witness box was presented with a printed page, and asked to read it aloud. She used two hands and her lips. One index finger tracked the words left to right across the page; the other moved down the lines, from top to bottom. She mouthed the words to herself before speaking them. She read the word “indicted” as “indicated.”</p>
				<p class="indent">The judge, Sonia Sotomayor, glanced at the clock. It was 11:13. At the end, she had a question for the witness, Marilyn Bartlett:</p>
				<p class="indent">“What did you just read?”</p>
				<p class="indent">“I haven’t got a clue,” Bartlett replied.</p>
				<p class="indent">“Neither have I,” the judge replied.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Although the passage was just 426 words, it had taken Bartlett—who had earned a doctorate in education and a law degree and had her verbal IQ measured as “superior”—eleven minutes to read it, the sentences so excruciatingly drawn out that no one could remember their meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">After listening to the testimony of the defendant’s experts and listening to Bartlett read “haltingly and laboriously,” the judge found for the plaintiff, determining that <i>“by its very nature, diagnosing a learning disability requires clinical judgment”</i> and is <i>“not quantifiable merely by test scores.”</i> Consideration of the condition, manner, or duration of how a person carries out the life activity of reading (or speaking or learning) is consistent with Judge Sotomayor’s determination that the diagnosis of dyslexia is not, and should not be, restricted to a consideration of a score on a test. This landmark case <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_476" title="476"/>highlighted the dangers of relying on automatic numerical cutoff scores for determining if a person is disabled or not. The Bartlett case is extremely important for bright students who are able to self-accommodate and score average or better on a test of reading but who at the same time are not able to read in the same condition, manner, or duration as most people in the population. This case is important, too, because it highlights that the diagnosis of dyslexia is a clinical one and is not, and should not be, made by test scores alone.</p>
			<p class="indent">One would think that with the signing of the ADAAA and the explicit language expressed in the Final Rule, dyslexic students who are bright, work extremely hard, and earn grades that permit hopes of attending college or graduate, medical, business, or law school would have minimal difficulties obtaining accommodations on high-stakes exams. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. Some deserving dyslexic individuals have continued to find it extremely difficult to obtain accommodations, even those who were diagnosed early on in school and have received accommodations throughout their school careers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some hardworking young men and women applying for accommodations to a range of testing agencies—including the SAT, LSAT, MCAT, and U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)—and medical certification boards still face a barrage of requests for more and more information, including difficult-to-obtain records, such as demanding the elementary-school records of a thirty-five-year-old applicant. Far too often the litany of requests results in delay after delay, and often expensive retesting for a lifelong <span id="ftn-202"/>disability.</p>
			<p class="indent">The testing agencies have seemed to be functioning as a law unto themselves. Some students have received accommodations; however, less than 2 percent of college students were applying for accommodations, in contrast to the known 20 percent who are dyslexic. The assumption is that many dyslexic students become discouraged and do not apply for accommodations. Many who did apply found that the agencies seemed to flout the ADA and denied their accommodations. A dyslexic physician was rejected for accommodations by the American Board of Pediatrics with a justification that seems contradictory to the intent and letter of the ADAAA:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					The ADA Amendments Act, like its predecessor law, the Americans with Disabilities Act, covers individuals who are “substantially limited” in a major life activity as the result of a disability. It appears that your history does not reflect the magnitude of symptoms or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_477" title="477"/>global impairment required to support a diagnosis of substantial impairment in academic functioning…the ABP will be unable to provide test accommodation for your General Pediatrics Certifying Examination.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Despite the enactment of the ADAAA specifically calling for the determination of who is “substantially limited” to be broadly interpreted, the testing agencies appeared not to be listening. These testing entities, wielding extraordinary power, appeared not to be answerable to any authority, to have no accountability, and rather seemed to function without any external oversight or restraints. There was and continues to be concern, too, over the potential bias of the external reviewers who were recruited and paid by the testing agencies and thus were not independent. Still another concern: If an applicant, following a denial of accommodations, requests a second review, the new reviewer may be biased by previous reviews provided by the testing agency. Perhaps most pernicious, in the denial letters, testing agencies have noted that accommodations are not intended for bright students coming from “elite” schools—students who the testing companies claim just want to increase their scores. The testing agencies appear to adhere to the myth that applicants who request accommodations are trying to game the system, a belief not supported by the evidence.</p>
			<p class="indent">These agencies’ actions and statements reflect an ignorance not only of science but also of the law as expressed in the Final Rule. The agencies often misquote facts and seem to rely instead on personal biases rather than on factual evidence. Agency reviewers, who have never examined or even seen the applicant, second-guess the recommendations of the professional who evaluated that young man or woman—an individual who may have more experience and knowledge and who certainly has a better sense of the applicant gained from spending many hours with him or her. As evidenced by the denial letter to the applicant for accommodations quoted above, the agencies often appear to be misquoting and misapplying the law.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most upsetting of all, the agencies seemed to be looking for almost any reason or excuse to deny an applicant the requested accommodation. Applicants were frequently placed in a no-win situation in the interpretation of their scores. If their scores were in the average range, they were often told that their scores were not low enough for them to be considered disabled; if their scores were very low, they were accused of malingering. The result: Society was losing valuable human resources and individuals’ lives were upended. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_478" title="478"/>Denied accommodation, facing endless delays, or failing unaccommodated tests, applicants would have to drastically lower their ambitions.</p>
			<p class="indent">A brilliant young woman, Lisa, who had been identified as dyslexic in primary school and in whom a recent evaluation indicated superior intelligence and dyslexia, had acquired an excellent academic record at a rigorous college with accommodations and was encouraged by her admiring instructors to apply to law school. She applied for accommodations and was rejected, even after an appeal. Frustrated and unsure of how long she would have to keep applying for accommodations and of the outcome, Lisa gave up her dream of becoming an attorney. Her mother aptly commented, “If my daughter decides she no longer wants to attend law school, that’s her prerogative; however, the decision should not be made for her by the Law School Admissions Council.”</p>
			<p class="indent">If the Final Rule had been published earlier, it would likely have provided Lisa with the backing of the Department of Justice. In fact, in the Final Rule the DOJ specifically takes on many of the arguments that testing agencies such as LSAC and USMLE have used in the past. For example, the Final Rule specifies that the DOJ does not agree with the assertions made by testing and educational entities that evidence of testing and grades is objective and therefore should be weighted more heavily, while evidence of self-mitigating measures, informal accommodations, or recently provided accommodations or modifications is inherently subjective and should be afforded less consideration. Congress’s discussion of the relevance of testing outcomes and grades clearly indicates that it did not consider them definitive evidence of the existence or nonexistence of a disability. While tests and grades typically are numerical measures of performance, the capacity to quantify them does not make them inherently more valuable with respect to proving or disproving disability. To the contrary, Congress’s incorporation of rules of construction emphasizing broad coverage of disabilities to the maximum extent permitted, its direction that such determinations should neither contemplate ameliorative mitigating measures nor demand extensive analysis, and its recognition of learned and adaptive modifications all support its openness for individuals with impairments to put forward a wide range of evidence to demonstrate their disabilities.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Final Rule emphasizes that Congress made clear its intention that the ADA’s protections should encompass people whose impairment requires an assessment that focuses on <i>how</i> they engage in major life activities rather than the ultimate <i>outcome</i> of those activities. In addition, the Final Rule clarifies that mitigating measures can include “learned behavioral or adaptive neurological <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_479" title="479"/>modifications,” psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy, and “reasonable modifications” or auxiliary aids and services. The phrase “learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications” is intended to include strategies developed by an individual to lessen the impact of an impairment. The phrase “reasonable modifications” is intended to include informal or undocumented accommodations and modifications as well as those provided through a formal process.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Final Rule recognizes that students may have developed their own ways to support their disability in order to perform major activities required during daily life and that such measures cannot be used to find that the person is not substantially limited. Furthermore, the Final Rule notes that self-mitigating measures or undocumented modifications or accommodations for students who have impairments that substantially limit learning, reading, writing, speaking, or concentrating may include such measures as arranging to have multiple reminders for task completion; seeking help from others to provide reminders or to assist with the organization of tasks; selecting courses strategically (such as selecting courses that require papers instead of exams); devoting a far larger portion of the day, weekends, and holidays to study than students without disabilities; teaching oneself strategies to facilitate reading connected text or mnemonics to remember facts (including strategies such as highlighting and margin noting); being given extra time to complete tests; receiving modified homework assignments; or taking exams in a different format or in a less stressful or anxiety-provoking setting. Each of these mitigating measures, whether formal or informal, documented or undocumented, can improve the academic function of a student having to deal with a substantial limitation in a major life activity such as concentrating, reading, speaking, learning, or writing.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Final Rule also discusses the effect of the ADA Amendments Act on academic requirements in postsecondary education. Specifically, it notes that nothing in the act changed the existing ADA requirement that covered entities provide reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications, including academic requirements in postsecondary education, would fundamentally alter the nature of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations involved. The Final Rule emphasizes that Congress noted that the reference to academic requirements in postsecondary education was included “solely to provide assurances that the bill does not alter current law with regard to the obligations of academic institutions under the ADA.”</p>

			<p>In several extremely important cases, the DOJ has demonstrated its power to correct violations. There is the case of the dyslexic Yale medical student Fred Romberg. Currently a practicing anesthesiologist, Fred overcame serious obstacles that would have broken another person: having to support his family from age fourteen after his father returned from the Vietnam War with severe injuries, and being on his own since age sixteen. He worked as a mechanic at a community college garage, where a professor recognized that he was extremely smart and encouraged him to obtain a GED. He was referred to a learning specialist and, following a full evaluation, was diagnosed with dyslexia. Fred is highly intelligent and presents with an unexpected difficulty in reading quickly and automatically. As a result, he requires additional time to read. He can think and reason very quickly, and with some extra time to read, his comprehension is at the highest levels. With accommodations, primarily extra time, Fred rose from a GED to an associate of arts degree, to a BS in electrical engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, to an MS in electrical engineering at Cal Tech with a cumulative GPA of 3.7. He earned a pilot’s license, obtained both commercial and flight instructor licenses, and built his own plane, which he enjoys flying.</p>
			<p class="indent">With accommodations for his dyslexia on his MCAT (Medical College Admission Test), Fred was admitted to Yale Medical School, where he continued to receive accommodations, primarily extra time on tests, and performed well. Despite his prior history of accommodations and the recommendations of his professors and his evaluators, the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), the agency responsible for certifying that medical students have satisfactorily completed their initial medical training, via the gatekeeper U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), initially refused Fred accommodations. As a result, he failed the USMLE twice. Students must pass the USMLE in order to graduate from medical school. If unable to pass, Fred could not graduate and go on to a residency or, for that matter, a career and life as a physician.</p>
			<p class="indent">For more than three years the NBME refused to allow Fred accommodations on the USMLE. There was no question of his intelligence (he scored in the superior range), nor of his dyslexia (his history and symptoms as well as very poor reading fluency established that). The NBME simply based its refusal on the fact that Fred had grown up in a very poor household and therefore, they claimed, his reading problems were a result of his disadvantaged upbringing and not dyslexia, somehow perversely asserting that if you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_481" title="481"/>grow up poor, you cannot also be dyslexic. It seemed to overlook the fact that he excelled in math and science and had been able, with accommodations, to successfully complete a graduate degree at Cal Tech.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fred poignantly describes the anguish associated with watching his classmates graduate and move on and the embarrassment associated with having to explain to classmates, faculty, and friends why he was not graduating with his class. Not knowing if he would ever graduate or become a doctor was a persistent worry.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, after thirty-eight months of applying, being turned down, appealing, being turned down, reappealing and at the same time studying nonstop day and night and failing the USMLE without accommodations, Fred filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. The attorneys there agreed to take his case. The department investigated and in February 2011 announced that a settlement of Fred’s case had been reached and he would be allowed to take the test for the third time, this time <i>with</i> accommodations. With the accommodation of extra time, he handily passed this same examination without difficulty, showing that it had never been a matter of lack of knowledge but rather lack of time that caused him not to be able to show his ability and as a result to fail test after test. Given the extra time, he passed and was able to go on to a residency and his career. The settlement achieved by the DOJ changed the course of Fred’s life. Not only is his future coming to life as he completes his residency, Fred is now also happily married to Elaine, the love of his life, a strong, constant source of support.</p>
			<p class="indent">Literally as I was writing about Fred my cell phone rang: It was Fred himself, excited to share some good news with me that just happened that day, February 24, 2017. He had finished his last case in the operating room (he was a resident in anesthesiology), turned in his hospital badge, and picked up his Certificate of Completion of Anesthesiology Training. Fred had attained his goal. He is now a practicing anesthesiologist! I must admit a tear or two rolled down my cheeks hearing this. Fred finished by telling me, “You know, you are the very first person I called. You have made such a positive difference in my life.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Receiving accommodation not only made a world of difference to Fred personally but loudly announced that the Department of Justice meant to enforce the law of the land and will defend disabled men and women who request accommodations and whose rights are violated by the testing agencies. <span id="ftn-203"/>In a press release Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, noted:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_482" title="482"/>In the past, demands for unnecessary or redundant documentation, burdensome and expensive repeated professional evaluations, or irrelevant evaluative testing unrelated to the ability to demonstrate one’s knowledge or skills on an examination prevented individuals with appropriately documented disabilities from pursuing their chosen professions…. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, NBME is [now] committed to providing reasonable testing accommodations to persons with disabilities who seek to take the USMLE, in accordance with the requirements of the ADA. In addition, it will grant Frederick XX, a Yale Medical School student, the accommodations of double the standard testing time and a separate testing area to take the USMLE.</p>

			<p class="indent">Futures are improving, not only for potential physicians but also for other qualified dyslexic professional hopefuls, including attorneys. Despite what attorneys and judges know about the poor predictability of the LSAT, it remains a gatekeeper for prospective attorneys. By many accounts, the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), the organization responsible for the LSAT, has been particularly rigid about accepting requests for accommodations from dyslexic students. <span id="ftn-204"/>A 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report concluded that while there have been significant changes in the law governing accommodations, testing companies have not changed their policies and practice. A major recommendation in the report states that “it is imperative for Justice to establish a credible enforcement presence to detect, correct and prevent violations.” Responding to the GAO’s recommendations, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_484" title="484"/>the DOJ opened systematic investigations into the actions of specific testing agencies, focusing on those whose actions have resulted in an especially large number of complaints from disabled applicants. The most serious offender was the LSAC, the first agency the DOJ investigated. As a result, the LSAC has entered into a consent decree with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and the United States regarding testing accommodations for individuals with disabilities nationwide. The consent decree states, <span id="ftn-205"/>“LSAC shall ensure that documentation requests are reasonable and limited to the need for the testing accommodation requested.”</p>

			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-206"/>Sadly, there are some indications that the Law School Admissions Council is not fulfilling its obligation.</p>
			<p class="indent">These changes (despite some bumps in the road) strongly suggest that a new day, a more positive day, is on the horizon for dyslexic students requiring accommodations on high-stakes postsecondary exams. There are many to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_485" title="485"/>thank for this progress, and at the very top I would place the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division. I must admit that whenever I have had occasion to interact with the individuals employed there or seen the product of their efforts and dedication to justice, I am so proud, as corny as this may sound, to be an American.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>THE ELIMINATION OF FLAGGING</b></h3>
			<p>The practice of flagging the scores of tests taken with accommodations has been distressing to many students with disabilities. While the purpose of the accommodation is to place those with disabilities on a par with others taking the test, the asterisk placed next to the score telegraphs to all who see it that the test-taker has a disability. The evidence is strong that once an admissions committee sees the asterisk, the tendency is to place that applicant’s file on the bottom of the pile. The asterisk identifies the applicant as having an exception and his scores as ones the testing organization cannot validate.</p>
			<p class="indent">A civil rights law group, Disability Rights Advocates, filed a lawsuit on behalf of a physically disabled man, Mark Breimhorst, who charged that the Educational Testing Service’s (ETS) policy of flagging accommodated test scores with the notation “Scores Obtained Under Special Conditions” violated state (California) and federal antidiscrimination laws, “stigmatizing disabled students with a kind of scarlet letter.” The judge hearing the case ruled that the tests should “equally measure the skills of disabled and nondisabled test-takers” and then there would be no need to flag these scores. In a settlement reached between the civil rights group and ETS, the testing organization agreed to stop flagging the test scores of individuals with physical and learning disabilities who take these tests with accommodations. Initially the new policy applied to the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), and Praxis, a test for teachers. <span id="ftn-207"/>A blue ribbon panel was formed to reexamine flagging and make recommendations for the major standardized test, the SAT I. <span id="ftn-208"/>On July 15, 2002, the panel released its findings: “The majority position of the Panel was to discontinue the practice of flagging the SAT I based on scientific, psychometric, and social evidence.” I served on the panel and joined in the majority opinion, which noted the “compelling” evidence against flagging.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>WHAT DO STANDARDIZED HIGH-STAKES TESTS PREDICT?</b></h3>
			<p>
				Under scrutiny, these ubiquitous and influential tests do not seem to hold up very well; many of our assumptions concerning the tests and their predictive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_486" title="486"/>value turn out to be questionable. A study of over 55,000 students, published in 2020, reported that the predictive power of a student’s high school grade point average is five times greater than ACT scores at predicting college graduation, regardless of the high school attended. The imbalance between the power of these tests and their flawed nature is particularly harmful to those who are dyslexic. These tests measure the rapid retrieval of rote facts, which taps directly into the dyslexic’s phonologic weakness, while they are mostly unable to measure what may be his strongest assets, namely his ability to reason, to think abstractly, to see the big picture, and to think out of the box. These are the sorts of creative abilities that tend to reflect the dyslexic’s sea of strengths, the kinds of cognitive skills in which the dyslexic might score in the ninety-ninth percentile if they were measurable by a simple test.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-209"/>At the next level, the Law School Admission Tests are not proving themselves to be especially strong predictors of law school performance. One judge proposed that law schools <span id="ftn-210"/>“relax or even eliminate reliance on the LSAT.” As reported in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> the judge wrote that the test “does not predict success in the legal profession at all…. One must wonder why the law school concerns itself at all with an applicant’s LSAT score.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Law school admissions policies are changing. Students who apply to an ever-growing number of law schools now have the option of taking the GRE instead of the LSAT. Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law will allow all JD applicants to submit either the GRE or the LSAT score for admission. The University of Arizona College of Law and Harvard Law will also accept either the GRE or the LSAT. On October 17, 2017, the <i>New York Law Journal</i> reported that “Columbia Law School, Embracing GRE for Fall 2018, Is Latest School to Join Wave.” Without doubt, many other law schools will soon follow. Yes, it is once again appropriate to quote Bob Dylan: “The times they are a-changin’.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The United States Medical Licensing Examination has been criticized by those such as Dr. Stephen Smith, professor emeritus of family medicine and formerly associate dean of student affairs at Brown University School of Medicine, and the late Dr. Graeme Hammond, professor emeritus of surgery at Yale University School of Medicine, both of whom served on the National Board of Medical Examiners and participated in the test-making process. According to Dr. Hammond, “I shudder when I think about how those questions were constructed…. I believe that the time has come to get rid of these examinations which test the ability to take multiple-choice tests and little more.”</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_487" title="487"/><b>A TIME FOR HOPE</b></h2>
			<p>
				Science, morality, and the law are converging to provide the rationale, the societal good, and the legal grounds to support the provision of accommodations to students who are dyslexic. More and more, learned groups are questioning the role of these tests. For example, in 2001, Richard C. Atkinson, then president of the University of California, proposed <span id="ftn-211"/>“an end to the use of <span id="ftn-212"/>SATs as a requirement for admission to the state university system…one of the largest and most prestigious.” Atkinson indicated that “he would like to move away from numerical measurements of student aptitude and encourage a more ‘holistic’ approach to evaluating candidates.” Moving forward, as noted on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c27_r1.xhtml#page_379">this page</a>, <span id="ftn-213"/>as of 2018, there were over one thousand four-year colleges and universities that did not rely on the SAT or ACT to admit bachelor-degree students.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-214"/>As for higher levels of education, a comprehensive study published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA</i>) suggests that a nontraditional approach to medical school admissions produces physicians whose postgraduate training and career experiences are indistinguishable from those selected through more usual procedures. In this study carried out at the University of California at Davis, the researchers were interested in the consequences of an admissions process in which special consideration was given to a range of factors considered important in choosing future physicians. The goal was to select the “best” applicants but not to be bound by the traditional criteria of grade-point averages and medical school admissions test scores. Students who scored poorly on standardized tests but who demonstrated other, more difficult-to-measure qualities were eligible for consideration by the admissions committee. In this study, which extended from 1968 through 1987, approximately 350 students were admitted by special consideration criteria; 67 percent did not meet the minimum standardized test criterion set by the school for admission, while a smaller number did not meet the minimum undergraduate GPA. The admissions committee was able to disregard the results of standardized tests and select students who went on to successful completion of medical school and residencies. By the time they were residents and in practice, the special group was indistinguishable from their higher-scoring classmates. As a <i>JAMA</i> editorial said:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span id="ftn-215"/>UC Davis applicants who qualified for the special admissions programs because their Medical College Admissions Tests (MCAT) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_488" title="488"/>scores and GPAs were <i>below</i> the “minimum” established for regular admission had excellent outcomes that were comparable to those admitted in the usual way. The students with higher MCAT scores and GPAs were not significantly more likely to graduate, complete residency successfully, become licensed, attain board certification, or enter the full range of career opportunities (including academic medicine) than were the students admitted under the special admission program. If the highest MCAT scores and GPAs are not predictive of these outcomes, they are not meaningful admissions factors.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">There is accumulating evidence—in undergraduate admissions, in graduate school, and now in law and medical school—that reliance on standardized test scores as reliable predictors of future performance is not fulfilling its promise. Such scores may not select the best students, and in fact may be keeping out those students who have the ability not only to graduate successfully but to contribute in unique ways to their profession. The failure of numerical scores to differentiate between who will and who will not become a good doctor substantially increases the work of the admissions committee members; they will clearly need to rely on other, hopefully more valid criteria.</p>
			<p class="indent">The importance of the more intangible qualities—of getting beyond the facts—is of more than theoretical interest. These are the kinds of qualities that impact our daily lives, that can make the difference between a good scientist, physician, lawyer, artist, or writer and a great one. It’s really all about the difference between relying on an accumulation of facts compared to thinking on a higher plane, and this is why we must not cede the selection of the next generation’s leaders to how well they can score on mechanical standardized tests. We must take in all the information about a person, including the kinds of data that are not subject to easy reduction. Creativity is too large and too far-ranging to be fit into the narrow confines of a bubble response to a multiple-choice question.</p>
