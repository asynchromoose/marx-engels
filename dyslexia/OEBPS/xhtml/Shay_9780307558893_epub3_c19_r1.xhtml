			<h2 class="head"><b>FLUENCY</b></h2>
			<p>Fluency, the ability to read a text accurately, quickly, and with good intonation (prosody), is the hallmark of a skilled reader. Children who are fluent readers love to read. Since reading requires little energy for them, it’s relaxing and easy for them to get lost in a book. They are the ones who come to the dinner table with book in hand or want to keep their bedroom light on at night to finish “just one more chapter.” In contrast, for a nonfluent reader, opening a book is hardly a welcome event.</p>
			<p class="indent">To appreciate fluency, let me introduce you to a pair of young readers, Amelia and Christy, who are classmates in the fourth grade. Both girls are extremely bright and attend their school’s Talented and Gifted (TAG) program.</p>
			<p class="indent">Recently Christy has developed headaches that often keep her at home. She was never considered a problem reader, although her reading skills seemed to lag behind her capacity to understand stories read to her. Christy will do anything to avoid reading. When she does read, she has to devote all her attention to deciphering the words—often making several attempts before correctly reading a word aloud—and therefore has little energy left to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252" title="252"/>consider the meaning of the passage she is reading. She reads in an expressionless monotone that is difficult to follow. Amelia, on the other hand, glides across the lines of text, adjusting her tempo or modulating her voice to reflect its meaning. Amelia is fluent, Christy is not.</p>
			<p class="indent">If parents and teachers understood the essential role of fluency in skilled reading and how effectively it can be facilitated, fluency would no longer be the most neglected reading skill. <span id="ftn-127"/>The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data examining fluency reported that 45 percent of fourth-grade boys and girls were not yet fluent readers. That is shocking, given the fact that children are expected to develop into fluent readers by the end of second grade. Perhaps this is because many educators believe that once a child can read words accurately, the work of becoming a reader—and of teaching reading—is complete. In fact, reading words accurately only brings a child to the jumping-off point for skilled reading, and this is where a parent (and teacher) can play a significant role in helping her land there.</p>
			<p class="indent">Children learn to read a word accurately, and then, after sufficient practice, to read the print fluently. Listen to a skilled reader as he reads aloud and you notice that he is not simply decoding words but rather has progressed to comprehending the meaning of the words before him. Fluency describes how a skilled reader reads. I reserve the term <i>automatic</i> for the brain processes that make fluent reading possible. Remember, we believe that the neural circuitry within the brain has reinforced all the features of a word so that a mere glance at that word instantly integrates the orthography, phonology, and meaning of the word in the word form area located in the back of the left side of the brain. That is why we believe fluent readers are able to read not only accurately and rapidly but, most important, with good intonation reflecting good understanding.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fluency forms the bridge between decoding, that is, reading a word accurately, and comprehension, understanding what you read (see Figure 45). Children acquire it word by word, or word group by word group, reflecting the words they have read and fully mastered by repeated exposure<i>—if</i> they begin pronouncing the word correctly. It isn’t as if suddenly a child reads all words fluently. For some people as few as four correct readings are necessary for automatic recognition of a word, while as many as twelve correct readings may be necessary for others. And while accuracy is a necessary precursor to fluency, accuracy does not necessarily evolve into fluency. This is especially true of a dyslexic child, who is not able to call upon the specialized word <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_253" title="253"/>form area and must instead rely on slower, ancillary neural pathways for reading. These pathways are effective for accurate reading but not for fluency.</p>

			<p class="indent"><i>One of the most important components of a complete reading program is for the child to begin to read connected text, not just words in isolation, early on.</i> Reading connected text provides the all-important pathway to meaning, to understanding that the printed words on the page are connected and sending the reader a message. Fluent reading frees up the reader’s attention so that it can be devoted more fully to comprehending what the message says. Reading connected text also provides the child a vital opportunity not only to increase her vocabulary and background knowledge but to improve her ability to read individual words by allowing her to see words in different contexts, which may influence how the words are pronounced and their meaning. That is why children need to begin to read connected text (first decodable, then authentic text) just as soon as they begin to learn how to decode individual words.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>TEACHING FLUENCY: WHAT WORKS BEST</b></h2>
			<p>When the National Reading Panel reviewed almost a hundred research articles on teaching fluency, they made the important discovery that the programs that work most effectively and produce the largest gains share three key features:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>(1) a focus on a child’s <i>oral</i> reading</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>(2) opportunities for practice, allowing a child to read and to reread words <i>aloud</i> in connected text</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>(3) ongoing feedback as a child reads.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_254" title="254"/><span id="ftn-128"/>More recent studies replicate and support the findings of the NRP.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Reading aloud makes feedback possible. Silent reading does not.</i> The feedback is essential, because it enables a child to modify his pronunciation of a specific word and simultaneously to correct the components of the neural model of that word so that it continuously reflects the exact pronunciation and spelling of the word. Needless to say, the feedback must be carried out in a constructive and positive manner. You must not risk having the child lose self-confidence or develop a fear of reading aloud in front of others. The person who is listening to the child read has to be skilled enough to see where the breakdowns in the reading process are occurring and intervene at that time and then say, “Okay, read that sentence again.” When the person listening realizes that the child is beginning to become frustrated with her poor reading fluency, the experienced listener will say, “Why don’t I take a turn? Let me read the next paragraph or two.”</p>
			<p class="indent">This overall technique of having the child read aloud to an experienced adult is referred to as <i>guided oral reading.</i> The guidance can come from a teacher, a tutor, or a parent. Once a child has received feedback from an adult and is fairly fluent, he can practice with a peer or even by listening to what he has read on a recorder or smartphone. Approaches using this method include echo reading, paired reading, repeated reading, shared reading, and assisted reading. In echo reading, the child’s teacher first models by reading a paragraph aloud, then the student reads the same paragraph aloud under the teacher’s guidance. The child reads the same selection at home that evening with a parent listening and gently providing corrective feedback. Then students pair up in class the next day (paired reading) and take turns reading each page (or paragraph) to one another. Paired reading not only helps reading fluency but also plays an important role in the development of self-esteem, as well as improving a child’s phonics skills. With this method, a teacher can keep track of and monitor a large number of children as they read in pairs. There is evidence that <i>paired reading, where meaning and discussion of content is an integral part of the practice, is effective in improving reading comprehension.</i> Recent studies, however, question whether guided oral reading should focus on the same material read multiple times (<i>repeated oral reading</i>) or on new materials (referred to as <i>continuous reading</i>). <span id="ftn-129"/>Results indicate that while both methods will increase word recognition and improve fluency, children who read new materials show greater growth in reading comprehension.</p>
			<p class="indent">As part of these studies, researchers had the opportunity to examine children <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255" title="255"/>who only listened to the teacher reading the stories instead of reading the stories themselves. These children did not make any gains in word recognition, fluency, or comprehension. Professor Melanie Kuhn of Purdue University College of Education notes that <span id="ftn-130"/>“while reading aloud to students is important in fostering a love of reading, learners must actively engage in the reading of connected text if they are to become skilled readers.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Guided oral reading helps poor and good readers in different ways. For someone struggling, reading a passage out loud over and over while receiving feedback is one more means of obtaining input to master a specific word. It helps the student build a more accurate neural representation of that word’s components within her brain and pronounce the word correctly. Rereading a passage aloud allows a good reader to integrate the word’s meaning with the surrounding text, giving him a better sense of the prosody or the rhythm of the passage.</p>
			<p class="indent">From its extensive review, the NRP concluded that guided oral reading programs “help improve children’s reading ability, at least through grade 5, and they help improve the reading of students with learning problems much later than this.” Nonetheless, the proven effectiveness of guided oral reading to increase fluency is too often ignored, which is unacceptable. In fact, <i>the evidence is so strong that I urge the adoption of these reading programs as an integral part of every school reading curriculum throughout primary school.</i> Guided oral reading may even be helpful to some students in middle or high school. This approach might also help readers master the special language peculiar to different academic disciplines, like biology and history. Remember, if a child has trouble pronouncing a word, he is unlikely to have integrated the features necessary to build an accurate representation of that word in his brain, and it will be difficult for him to store or to retrieve any information associated with that word. If troublesome words are pre-identified and practiced aloud with guidance, the child will more easily build the neural model for that word and connect relevant information to it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fluency training, one component of a comprehensive reading lesson, takes perhaps fifteen minutes or less per lesson. Keep in mind that a child must first read a word accurately before she can read it fluently. So in carrying out guided repeated oral reading with a child, it is important to have her practice reading passages at her comfort level. As I said earlier, children are comfortable with a book’s text when they can read about nineteen out of twenty words correctly; such a book is at the child’s <i>independent reading level.</i> A teacher can recommend books that she feels are appropriate. If your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_256" title="256"/>school participates in either the Lexile or the DRP reading programs, your child’s teacher will be able to give you a list of books matched to your child’s reading level and interest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For older elementary- and middle-schoolers, a good source of high-interest, low-readability (indicating relatively easy text) books can be found at <a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com">www.pearsonschool.com</a>, under “Pearson School Library Collection.” For example, Pearson’s version of <i>Moby-Dick</i> is written at a third- to fourth-grade level; <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> is written at a fourth- to eighth-grade level. Other good sources of this kind of reading material are available from Gander publishers and the Oxford School Shakespeare series, available from Amazon. This series includes not only the complete Shakespeare plays but also clear explanations of difficult words and passages, plot synopses, summaries of individual scenes, and notes on the main characters.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PARENTS CAN HELP BUILD FLUENCY</b></h2>
			<p>As an informed parent you can play a strong and active role in helping your child become a fluent reader. Typical readers generally begin to read fluently by the middle of second grade, dyslexic readers much later. You can gauge your child’s fluency by listening to how smoothly he reads and how well he is able to read with expression.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Listening to him read aloud often is the single most meaningful activity you can do in this process.</i> Put aside time for it each evening, or at least three or four times a week. Consistency is far more important than the amount of time devoted to each practice session. In these sessions, you can have him read to you or you can take turns reading aloud to one another—a paragraph, a page, a short chapter at a time. For a child who is struggling, it is often useful for you to read a little and then have him reread aloud the same material that you have just modeled reading. If you can, get a duplicate set of books so that each of you can follow along as the other reads. It is helpful to give your child a ruler or other level marker to place under each line as he reads or follows along so he keeps his place.</p>
			<p class="indent">The best texts for fluency-building are those that encourage reading with feeling, such as poetry and plays, which are meant to be performed orally, so that the child’s reading these out loud sounds natural. The objective is to have the student select reading materials that he can eventually practice enough to be able to read before an audience. Doing this emphasizes that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_257" title="257"/>rather than increased speed when practicing fluency, the goal is to read to extract <i>meaning.</i> This is why reading connected text is a must and preferable to simply reading words in isolation to gain speed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Too often educators focus their time and energy on having their students practice reading word lists and even connected texts quickly. While speed is important, extracting meaning from the text is more so. Educators must understand that the definition of fluency is the ability to read not only accurately and rapidly but also, and most important, with prosody. <i>Prosody is and must be a significant component of fluency.</i> Once a student has begun to master decoding, more attention and time need to be spent practicing reading connected text and on emphasizing the need to extract meaning from print—what the specific words tell the reader about the meaning of the phrase or sentence or paragraph. The automaticity that is integral to fluency allows the reader to shift his attention to meaning and comprehension. <i>Accurate and fast reading does not necessarily translate into increased comprehension, which is why fluency practice where meaning and comprehension are stressed is critical. It is not only practice and more practice that is necessary, but practice that stresses comprehension of what the print is telling the reader.</i> This is where the importance of prosody (reading with expression) becomes evident. Prosody, and with it comprehension, are revealed by oral reading pauses, speed, phrasing, loudness, and intonation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Evenings spent reading together build a lifelong pattern of enjoyment. I believe that the pleasures associated with this experience become built into the reading networks within a child’s brain. As a child matures into a teenager and then a young adult and no longer reads aloud with her parent, each time she picks up a book and begins to read she resurrects this happy memory of days when she snuggled next to her father or mother and learned about <i>The Cat in the Hat, Goodnight Moon, Danny and the Dinosaur, Robert the Rose Horse,</i> and, later on, <i>Pumpkin Smasher Witch</i> and <i>The Westing Game.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">The methods I have described here are meant for the typical reader: A dyslexic reader may require more (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c21_r1.xhtml#page_285">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="indent">To summarize, here is what parents and teachers should know about reading fluency:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>It includes accuracy, automaticity, and prosody (reading with expression).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>It is improved by a child reading aloud to an adult for fifteen minutes four or five times a week. The reading <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258" title="258"/>material should be at the child’s reading level and should be read at 85 to 90 percent accuracy. <span id="ftn-131"/>As the child’s fluency improves, he can be exposed to texts at a more difficult reading level.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>It is improved by <i>repeated</i> oral reading of the <i>same passage;</i> however, <i>continuous</i> oral reading of <i>different passages at a similar reading level</i> provides an even more powerful boost to increasing fluency as well as accuracy and vocabulary.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Once a child begins to read more and more words accurately and rapidly, he can turn his attention to more complex texts. At this stage, his higher thinking and reasoning skills come into play and, together with his vocabulary and knowledge of the world around him, help him derive meaning from his reading.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>BUILDING READING COMPREHENSION: VOCABULARY AND BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE</b></h2>
			<p>
				A mature reader must have the vocabulary and the background knowledge to understand and to place in context what he has just read. For example, if he comes across the words <i>Eiffel Tower,</i> he needs to know how to pronounce each word. But to give the words meaning, he also needs to know what the Eiffel Tower is. This calls on his word knowledge—his vocabulary. It is even better when he can place the word more fully in context—when he knows that the Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, that it was designed by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel for the exposition of 1889, and that it is a major tourist attraction. This sort of information is the reader’s worldly knowledge that helps him gain meaning from what he is reading. Word knowledge is found in the dictionary, worldly knowledge more likely in an encyclopedia, or today, in Wikipedia or on Google.</p>
			<p class="indent">A child does not simply open a book, decode the words, and magically understand the content. The extent and depth of his vocabulary and background knowledge play a major role in determining how well equipped he is to gain meaning from the text. Important, too, are the active thinking processes the reader uses to integrate his existing knowledge with the new information he encounters. In a general sense, these thinking processes can be regarded as reasoning. Based on this model, approaches to teaching <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_259" title="259"/>comprehension focus on strengthening and extending the child’s word and worldly knowledge and providing him with a series of strategies to organize and direct his thinking as he reads.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>BUILDING VOCABULARY: THE MEANING OF WORDS</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-132"/>The size of a child’s vocabulary is one of the best predictors of his reading comprehension; children with the largest vocabularies tend to be the strongest readers. A growing body of evidence suggests that increases in the quality and quantity of exposure to language and vocabulary in early childhood and verbal interaction with parents and caregivers are associated with improved language and vocabulary later in childhood.</p>
			<p class="indent">A significant factor in a child’s vocabulary in the early school years relates to the sophistication of the parents’ vocabulary during conversations with him and the degree to which the parents speak directly to him. In fact, parent-child interactions at a young age are far more important for language development than, for example, incidental exposure to language through television. Furthermore, the quality of teacher-child verbal interactions for preschoolers is positively related to children’s vocabulary and comprehension gains in the early school years. <span id="ftn-133"/>Language measures, including <i>receptive vocabulary</i>,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c19-ftn-1" id="c19-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*1</a></sup> in the early years were predictive of reading comprehension in elementary and middle school for both children at-risk of dyslexia and typically developing children.</p>
			<p class="indent">Strategies focusing on the early introduction of reading books to young children offer a potential avenue to improving language, particularly vocabulary. It has long been known that books stimulate vocabulary because they contain a wider vocabulary than occurs in ordinary conversations, and even simple stories for toddlers include more complex words and phrases than the content of typical parent-child conversation.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-134"/>In a recent report we used data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study to examine growth in reading comprehension and verbal ability from grades one through nine. We found that in the early grades vocabulary was not strongly related to reading comprehension. However, for grade five and beyond, vocabulary had a much stronger influence. These data, along with what we know about the importance of early language development for reading <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_260" title="260"/>comprehension, point to a combined approach to reducing the achievement gap in reading between typical and dyslexic readers:</p>

				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Encouraging oral language in general, and building vocabulary in particular, throughout early childhood and continuing through the school years</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Encouraging evidence-based instruction that systematically develops the skills of phonologic awareness, decoding, word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension in school</p>
			</div>
			<h2 class="head"><b>BECK’S FRAMEWORK: BUILDING VOCABULARY</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-135"/>Isabel Beck, professor emerita in the School of Education at the University of Pittsburgh, and her University of Pittsburgh coauthors, Margaret McKeown and Linda Kucan, provide a framework for systematically building vocabulary. They speak of three tiers of vocabulary. Tier 1 consists of common words found in oral language. Tier 2 consists of words found in written language which are of high utility. Tier 3 consists of words that are limited to specialized domains, such as law, medicine, and archaeology. Since Tier 1 words are already known and Tier 3 words are so specialized, the focus should be on learning Tier 2 words.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the beginning of school, most of the words a child encounters in print will be in his spoken vocabulary—Tier 1 words. Then, sometime around third grade, the words he comes across in print are less likely to be familiar to him—Tier 2 words. This marks a pivotal point in the child’s growth as a skilled reader. He must therefore build up his vocabulary so he can recognize these less familiar words when he reads them. Beck and her colleagues provide examples of Tier 2 words, including <i>comment, occurrence, tended, mention, emerging, admit,</i> just to name a few.</p>
			<p class="indent">The basic principles of vocabulary instruction are for the children to have frequent and varied experience with the target words and robust teaching. <span id="ftn-136"/>Vocabulary is best learned by multiple exposures to the word over time, usually about twelve encounters. While it is possible for teachers to introduce as many as ten new words each week, a more reasonable approach is to focus on five to seven new words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Vocabulary instruction that works best involves the child in actively getting to the word from every possible perspective. The more connections <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_261" title="261"/>he can make between this new word and the words and world he knows, the more salient the word is and the more likely he is to make it a part of his usable vocabulary. Once a new word is introduced, an essential part of the learning process is to encourage the child to use the word as much as possible—initially just to make sentences with it, then to incorporate it into his everyday life. Having repeated encounters with the same word also helps to ensure that its meaning is tightly woven into the automatic reading circuits within the child’s brain and that subsequently it can be retrieved quickly.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>In teaching vocabulary, the intent is for the child to regard any new word as a fully formed idea, more than just a label.</i> Rather than reciting a word’s definition by rote or rattling off a synonym, the goal is for the child to make that word an active part of his thinking process. A word is most likely to spring to life if a child can integrate it with familiar ideas or with his own past experiences. For example, if the new word is <i>transmission</i> and the student is familiar with cars and how they work, he will quickly integrate <i>transmission</i> into his knowledge base and use the word as part of his active vocabulary. It is important to keep in mind that it is the ideas that take precedence and that the lion’s share of the time spent teaching should be devoted to discussions of the ideas represented by specific words. In fact, it is often better to discuss the word’s meaning and relevance before naming it. For the word <i>emerging,</i> for example, think of referring to a technology that is just about to come out. In effect, this creates a cradle to catch and hold the word once it is mentioned.</p>
			<p class="indent">A child’s vocabulary grows by about three thousand new words a year. These words can be directly and explicitly taught as part of a vocabulary program, or the words can be acquired implicitly, as most of them are in middle-class children, through everyday life experiences—hearing his parents’ conversations, those of his peers and teachers, on television and in the movies, on trips to the museum and to the supermarket, or through reading. For the middle-class child, only a small proportion of his vocabulary will come from direct instruction. In contrast, for disadvantaged, often minority students, there may be a paucity of vocabulary from the adults around him, which means that if vocabulary is to improve, it will need to be taught explicitly in school—most importantly early on, in kindergarten and first grade. For children in the earliest grades, the best way to teach vocabulary is for the teacher to read books aloud and then, after the story has been read, to select words for review.</p>
			<p class="indent">For school-age children overall, a useful guide is <i>The Educator’s Word Frequency <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_262" title="262"/>Guide,</i> available from Questar in hardcover as well as on a CD (the CD is somewhat expensive). This guide, created from more than sixty thousand samples of text from more than six thousand textbooks, works of literature, and popular works of fiction and nonfiction, presents a quantitative summary of the printed vocabulary encountered by students in American schools and is helpful in designing instructional materials tailored to the age and educational progress of students. Other useful resources include <a href="http://vocabulary.com">vocabulary.com</a>, VocabularySpellingCity (<a href="http://Spellingcity.com">Spellingcity.com</a>), and <a href="http://textproject.org/teachers/word-lists">textproject.org/teachers/word-lists</a>. <span id="ftn-137"/>This latter program has a number of very helpful word lists, including the thousand most frequent words in texts for grades three to nine. Word lists available from Oxton House (<a href="http://www.oxtonhouse.com">www.oxtonhouse.com</a>) are also helpful.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>THE PARENTS’ ROLE</b></h3>
			<p>A parent can easily follow the teacher’s lead. For example, as your child delves into a book, you can ask her to pick out one or two new words in each chapter for later study and discussion. She can highlight the words, place a Post-it on the page, or jot the word down. Later the two of you can look at how the word is used in the text. Talk about what it might mean. Look for clues in the surrounding words. Does it elicit any images or connections to your child’s life experiences? Does she know any similar words? Talk about what the words have in common and how they differ. What other words can you both think of that bring to mind the same idea or concept? Write the words down. Take a pad and pencil and see how many words the two of you can generate as part of your personal brainstorming. Categorize the words together. Have your daughter use each word in a sentence. Have her play word detective and see how many times she sees or hears the word in the next twenty-four hours, and then revisit the word and continue your discussion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creative teachers and parents have developed other useful aids for vocabulary instruction that go beyond books and beyond the classroom. In one highly successful program, children competed to become a “Word Wizard,” receiving points for bringing to class a newly learned vocabulary word they had used, seen, or heard in a different context outside of school.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dictionaries are useful as a starting point but often provide sparse definitions of words. All children in third grade and above benefit from knowing how to look up words in a dictionary, but learning about words should not be limited to this one source. <a href="http://Dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> is a helpful online resource for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_263" title="263"/>looking up word definitions, synonyms, and antonyms, with an additional “word of the day” feature that produces a constant stream of new words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dictionary definitions, concise as they usually are, are sometimes hard for children to understand. One very helpful dictionary for young children is the <i>Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English</i> (<a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com">www.ldoceonline.com</a>), which presents clear, child-friendly definitions using only the two thousand most common words in English. The utility of this dictionary is enhanced because the definition is usually accompanied by an example as well. Another useful dictionary website is <a href="http://Onelook.com">Onelook.com</a>, which offers access to many dictionaries.</p>
			<p class="indent">The nature of instruction should be <i>flexible,</i> depending on the word itself. Some words, such as <i>democracy,</i> require a full discussion along with examples; other words, such as <i>double helix,</i> are best learned through images as well as explanations. Everything is fair game, even using English muffins or a Tennyson poem, “Flower in the Crannied Wall,” to learn about <i>nooks and crannies.</i> Learning new words also benefits from <i>repetition</i> and <i>reinforcement.</i> Conceptually challenging words need to be introduced and discussed over and over again; a child does not assimilate and use a word after meeting it once, twice, or even three times. It takes many repetitions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Children can be encouraged to use their knowledge of word parts, specifically prefixes, suffixes, Latin roots, and Greek stems, to pull an unknown word apart and determine its meaning. Just as you don’t try to teach your child every unfamiliar word in a story, it is helpful to focus on learning only the most important of the hundreds of affixes and roots. If your child comes to know these really well, he will be able to substantially add to his reading vocabulary. Fortunately, only a relative few of these word parts occur with any real frequency. Just twenty prefixes account for 97 percent of all words with prefixes found in English schoolbooks, and nine of these prefixes account for 75 percent of all prefixed words. Here are the most common ones:</p>

			<p class="indent">Since a child gains much of her vocabulary incidentally, it is important to maximize her ability to learn new words as a result of her everyday experiences. The guiding principle here is that the richer and denser her network of <i>worldly knowledge,</i> the greater the possibility that a new word will find a relevant hook to latch on to, activate her existing knowledge, and be integrated within this network. Similarly, the larger a child’s <i>vocabulary</i> is, the more likely she is to understand and to relate to a new idea or bit of information. The more she is exposed to a range of meaningful experiences and <i>the more she reads, the greater her vocabulary and knowledge network.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Parents and teachers can encourage children to pay attention to and learn new words. One father I know, Hayden, used his hobby of keeping an aquarium as a learning experience for his son, Jeremy. As a child, Jeremy accompanied his father to the pet store to buy supplies and to select new fish. Before setting out, father and son looked through their many books on fish, read about the different types of fish and their care, selected the ones they were most interested in, and wrote the names on a list. At first Hayden did all the reading, with Jeremy looking at the pictures and following along. Soon Jeremy was able to recognize the words in print and pointed to the words <i>zebra fish, shark, angelfish, parrot fish,</i> or <i>clownfish</i> whenever that name appeared. After a while father and son began to read together aloud. As Jeremy entered the fourth grade, he read more and more of the selections to his father. Discussions between father and son soon centered on not only fish but algae, corals, anemones, chlorophyll, predators, infections fish are prone to, evolution, and ecology. What began as an interest in aquarium <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_265" title="265"/>fish expanded into a much broader interest in the sea and creatures of the sea. Other parents have used a child’s interest in baseball, soccer, dogs, cars, skateboarding, dollhouses, politics, space, or horses as the impetus for the development of a larger vocabulary and a broader, enriched view of the world.</p>
			<p class="indent">There is no one formula for teaching a child new words. Rather, it is important to keep in mind that each and every experience is an opportunity for learning—going fishing, visiting Grandma, playing baseball, putting groceries away after shopping, taking a walk in the woods, hearing news on television, and reading (books, magazines, newspapers, and even labels and signs). The key is to expose a child to as many different kinds of experiences as possible and to talk to him about these experiences and the words they generate in an open-ended way so that there are no wrong answers—and then to encourage him to use the new words as often as possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">For adolescents thinking of college and young adults planning on professional or graduate school, an important group of words to learn are those in the Academic Word List (<a href="https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist/most-frequent">https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist/most-frequent</a>), developed in New Zealand and generated from academic texts in a variety of subject areas. Examples include <i>distribute, conclusion, proceed, logical, obtain, acquire, retain, exclude, attribute, assume, capacity, enable, perspective, relevant, perceive, component, restrict, generate, distinct, assess, alter, amend,</i> and <i>contrast.</i></p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>HOW PARENTS CAN NURTURE READING COMPREHENSION</b></h2>
			<p>Just as parents can have a positive effect on fluency and vocabulary, they can have a similar effect on reading comprehension. A study carried out with six- and seven-year-olds determined that home reading habits are strong predictors of a child’s later performance in reading. Skilled readers who were read to more often by their parents were more likely to read with their parents and to talk about books and stories with them.</p>
			<p class="indent">As the child goes from early elementary school to later elementary and middle school, reading comprehension takes on an even more important role. As you know, reading comprehension is the result of a complex interplay of the child’s decoding skills and reading fluency in combination with her vocabulary, background knowledge, and reasoning ability. Comprehension is often thought of as the process of making connections between new <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266" title="266"/>information in the text and the known information the reader brings. We often talk of three levels of comprehension:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>literal or factual comprehension</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>inferential comprehension</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>critical or evaluative comprehension</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">While in the past literal comprehension was the primary focus of instruction, with the introduction of Common Core State Standards (CCSS)<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c19-ftn-2" id="c19-ftn2" role="doc-noteref">*2</a></sup> it is the inferential and critical levels of comprehension that are emphasized. What this means is that parents (and teachers) need to focus comprehension strategies on building background knowledge by <i>providing vivid examples, fostering imagery, teaching the child how to compare and contrast, and fostering hypothesis generation and prediction.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Comprehension strategies should begin to emphasize getting away from low-level factual questions to asking and answering higher-level questions that require the child to use not only the information presented in the text but also her background knowledge and reasoning skills. In addition to reading, the child should also be taught to combine her writing skills to summarize and synthesize what she has read.</p>
			<p class="indent">I like to divide reading comprehension activities into three parts: those things you can do before opening the book, others that are most helpful as the child reads, and others that help him to organize his thoughts and sum up the events of the story after he finishes reading. These activities are fun but intensive. <i>By no means should you feel obligated to go through each one of these for each book you and your child read together.</i> I am laying out a range of possibilities. You must decide which of these best suit you and your child. There is no one right way or one set formula to teach comprehension skills to your child. The idea is to transfer a way of actively thinking about reading to your child. Once he has assimilated this, he is an independent reader.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Before the Book Is Opened.</i> Right from the start, it is important to establish a purpose for reading—one of which is to find out what is going to happen to the main character or how the mystery will be solved. There are a number of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_267" title="267"/>ways you can start a child thinking about purpose. Point out the book’s title and author. If there is an illustration on the cover, you might talk about what it says about the book and its purpose. Scanning through a book prior to reading helps to familiarize the reader with its content and to give him a sense of where the book (or chapter) is going. Consider <i>The Story About Ping</i> by Marjorie Flack and Kurt Wiese. The cover drawing is of a scampering duck and a background of Chinese junk boats resting in a river as the sun is going down. Turning the pages reinforces images of Ping, the scampering duck; other ducks; boats; water; a little boy holding Ping; and Ping surrounded by a host of ducks amid lots of hay at the book’s end. You can ask your child what he thinks this book seems to be about and what he is anticipating will happen in the story.</p>
			<p class="indent">The cover picture of Ping can spawn a discussion of ducks, visits to a farm, or what you know about ducks. Do ducks like water? Do they swim? What do you think Ping is doing in the water? What about the boat? Looking at the cover, you can see a setting sun visible in the distance. Ask your child what time of day he thinks the cover portrays and why. Ask him if he thinks this is going to be a happy or sad story and why. You are modeling for your child how a good reader proceeds. <i>A skilled reader is an active reader, not someone adrift; he reads purposefully, making predictions and wanting to know if his predictions are validated or if he needs to alter them.</i> Making such predictions draws your child into the story and makes him eager to go on.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is always a good idea to anticipate any potentially difficult or unfamiliar words or concepts. If you have the time, you should preread or scan through the chapter or book to identify the worrisome words. In this story, the word <i>Yangtze</i> is likely to be a new one for your child. You could show him on a globe where the Yangtze River is located, or you could talk about rivers, including any that are in your local area or that you have visited. In this way you are helping to activate your child’s background knowledge by relating this story to things that he already knows about or that are meaningful to him. Finally, you might try to relate it to other stories, such as those about ducks. These strategies are quite flexible. You can apply them with your child while you read to him or later on, as he reads to you.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>During Reading.</i> Start out by commenting on the first few sentences or first paragraphs of the story. This ensures that your child is actively involved from the very beginning. Opening sentences are critical, for they often set <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_268" title="268"/>the stage for the entire story and introduce you to the place and characters. In <i>The Story About Ping,</i> we immediately meet Ping and his “mother and father and two sisters and three brothers and eleven aunts and uncles and forty-two cousins.” We find out that “their home was a boat with two wise eyes on the Yangtze River.” Just a few short paragraphs later, we learn that “Ping was always careful, very careful not to be last, because the last duck to cross over the bridge always got a spank on the back.” At this point you can pause to reflect on what has been learned so far and what the author might be preparing the reader for. You can ask, “Do you think there’s a chance that Ping might be last on the boat when we turn the page? Why? And if he is, what do you think he might do? What would you do?” By talking about the story and how your child might relate to it, you are drawing him into the narrative and raising his interest level. This is important to do right from the start, because once a child loses interest, it is hard to bring him back into the flow of the story. On the other hand, once he is part of the unfolding events, he is hooked and will want to know what happens next.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is also important to establish the <i>who, what, where,</i> and <i>when</i> right from the beginning. This information represents the structure of the story; it provides reference points for discussion and anchors the narrative. Knowing these story facts can also help your child to visualize what is happening, encouraging him to bring up images that he associates with the place or people. Holding such an image in mind is one more connection to the action in the book and to better comprehension. Just as you did earlier on, you can identify and talk to him about difficult words or concepts; in <i>Ping</i> these could be <i>wise, scurrying, running away,</i> or <i>reunion.</i> Ask your child to point out what he sees as difficulties affecting the characters in the story and then to suggest some possible solutions. You can talk about the ramifications of each. As you read on, ask him if his predictions need to be changed or modified, and ask him to explain his thinking.</p>
			<p class="indent">From time to time you can ask your child to summarize the plot, to recount the sequence of events that has occurred, or to tell you the main idea in a paragraph you have just read. The last of these helps your child differentiate important from trivial or redundant information, a key factor in getting the gist of a story. To help enrich the story and to bring your child closer to it, ask him more about the characters. In this example, you can talk about Ping or the Master of the Boat who calls out “La-la-la-la-lei!” each evening, or even the little boy who plucks Ping from the water. Does he like each of them? Why? Do they remind him of anyone he knows or someone <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_269" title="269"/>he has read about before? How does the story make him feel: happy, sad, lucky, frightened, eager, or excited? Why? Follow the same pattern as you read other stories, always integrating your child and his experiences into the fabric of the story.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>After Finishing the Book.</i> Ask your child to summarize its plot, to tell you what happened and his feelings about it. See if he can retell the events in order. If not, this is the time to chart out aspects of the story visually, such as cause and effect or a particular sequence of events, using software such as <i>Inspiration</i> (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c32_r1.xhtml#page_450">this page</a>). Ask your child if he wants to read the story again. Ask if he wants to read more stories about the same topics: in this case, ducks, boats, rivers, or China.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because these activities involve basic reasoning skills, you can introduce them to your child even before he learns to read, and certainly before decoding instruction begins. Reading aloud to your child is an excellent way to get him started. One of the very first things you can teach your child about reading is that its purpose is to gain <i>meaning</i> from the printed word. You can show him what to look for and listen for in a story. You and your child can even act out characters. These kinds of activities bring the child into the story, encourage him to be an active listener, and help him acquire the kinds of skills that build meaning. They are developing his oral language skills, his vocabulary, his background knowledge, and his understanding of how books work.</p>
			<p class="indent">Books are the center of a child’s reading development. There are so many wonderful children’s books available, for every age, interest, and reading level (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_app_r1.xhtml#page_527">this page</a> in the Appendix). Introduce your child to books and reading very early on. Read to him as he gets older. Make sure he reads books (at his reading level or slightly above) aloud to you and that he reads books to himself as well. Initially he should be reading at least twenty minutes daily, and later, thirty minutes or more. Reading <i>consistently</i>—at least four to five days a week, even if for shorter periods of time—is more important than the length of time spent reading each day. Reading more frequently, especially aloud, will improve his reading skills, and that, more than anything else, will encourage him to want to read for longer periods of time. The basic skills he will require in order to comprehend and the strategies he will need to call on remain relatively stable over time. Once he begins reading instruction, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension skills should be taught alongside those focused more on decoding.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_270" title="270"/><i>CAUTION:</i> It is important for you to learn about the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), which are discussed in the Appendix. Keep in mind that CCSS <i>do not</i> focus on teaching decoding skills in the early grades. Such an omission is not in the best interests of dyslexic students.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Take your child to the library early, even before she is a reader. As soon as she is eligible, get your child her own library card. Going to the library frequently, attending story hour, and getting to know the children’s librarian at the neighborhood public library (and later on at school, too) are smart things to do for your child. The children’s librarian is an expert in children’s books and can be a wonderful resource for you and your child. As she gets to know your child and develops a sense of her interests, of her favorite books and authors, and of the kind of child she is, the librarian can alert her to books of interest, to upcoming events, and to newly arrived additions.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WHERE DOES WRITING COME IN?</b></h2>
			<p>
				While educators have made considerable progress in developing effective programs for reading and mathematics, writing is a topic that is often considered the orphan member of teaching the three <i>r</i>’s<i>.</i> Within the past few years writing has begun to receive attention from educators and researchers, especially in the work of Steven Graham and Karen Harris, professors at Arizona State University, who have studied and written extensively about writing, primarily for typical readers but with particular relevance for dyslexic students. Graham and Harris note that <span id="ftn-138"/>“the most critical element in creating an environment where students can prosper and grow as writers is for them to write.” They and others advise educators to make sure their students write frequently across the curriculum, write for real audiences, and make personal choices about what they write. Teachers should encourage the development of unique interpretations of assigned writing topics. Two additional scientifically based best practices include (1) teaching students about specific genres or characteristics of good writing, including teaching students that stories have a setting, a starting event, characters, actions, and a resolution, and (2) providing students with good models.</p>
			<p class="indent">Graham and Harris emphasize the importance of teaching writing strategies, especially encouraging students to view writing as a process. Particularly important strategies include those for planning, drafting, revising, and editing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_271" title="271"/>text. <i>The Educator’s Practice Guide: Teaching Elementary School Students to Be Effective Writers,</i> published by What Works Clearinghouse in 2018, uses helpful mnemonics for these strategies. For example, for planning, the student can remember POW, standing for</p>

				To reiterate Graham and Harris’s view, the most important component of writing is <i>frequent writing.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">These general pieces of advice, such as assigning lots of writing activities and providing exposure to good writing, will usually not be sufficient in teaching a dyslexic child to develop competent writing skills. A program that is highly successful with many children, including boys and girls who are dyslexic, and one that has become a particular favorite of mine, is Judith Hochman’s <i>Teaching Basic Writing Skills</i> (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c21_r1.xhtml#page_301">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="indent">Graham and Harris also stress the need for children to learn to type and use word processing in composing written essays. This allows the child to focus on the creative writing process rather than on physically forming letters and sentences.</p>

			<p class="indent">If this seems to describe your child, you need to confirm your impressions. Speak to his teacher and perhaps have your child tested at school. It is important to determine not only if he has a problem reading but the nature of the problem. Most often if a child is experiencing reading problems, it is a reflection of difficulty in decoding words accurately and reading fluently. He may be struggling with trying to get to the word itself.</p>
			<p class="indent">Knowledge is empowering, and now that you understand reading, you should have the confidence to help your child. Don’t worry about each and every detail. You know what to do and can act accordingly.</p>
