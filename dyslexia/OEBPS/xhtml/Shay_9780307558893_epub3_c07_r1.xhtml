				Functional MRI is remarkably patient-friendly, for both adults and children. In our research we have imaged hundreds at all ages with uniformly positive feedback.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c07-ftn-1" id="c07-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*1</a></sup> Virtually the same scanner used for MRIs to evaluate headaches or torn knee ligaments is used in functional imaging. All sorts of people have participated in our imaging studies of reading, including older adults, young adults, adolescents, and even children as young as six years old. For those readers who have not had an MRI, I want to explain briefly what it’s like by telling you about the experience of Kacie, age eight.</p>
			<p class="indent">When Kacie and her parents first arrived at the MRI center they were greeted by Marina, a research coordinator, who introduced the family to the center and helped Kacie feel at home. Marina then reviewed with Kacie the tasks she would be asked to perform as she was being imaged. Kacie quickly caught on and was soon ready for the imaging. In the scanning room she lay down on a sliding table with a large open tube at one end. At the start of the imaging, the table moved so that Kacie’s head lay comfortably within the open tube (Figure 16).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c07-ftn-2" id="c07-ftn2" role="doc-noteref">*2</a></sup> As she lay in the scanner, Kacie responded to each stimulus by pressing a <span class="smallcaps">YES</span> or a <span class="smallcaps">NO</span> button on a device she was holding <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_69" title="69"/>in her hands. This device measured how accurately and how rapidly she responded.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Once Kacie glided into the scanner, she looked up through a prism (periscope) just above her head to see the stimuli, pairs of words, as they were rapidly projected one after another on a screen in front of her. Nonsense but pronounceable words such as <i>LETE</i> and <i>JEAT</i> were used as stimuli, and Kacie was asked whether each pair rhymed. As shown in Figure 17, if the words rhymed, she pressed the <span class="smallcaps">YES</span> response button on the device she was holding in her hands.</p>
			<p class="indent">Since these words are made up, Kacie had never seen them before, so they could not have been memorized and had to be sounded out, ensuring that the neural pathways for phonologic analysis would be activated. As each pair of words flashed up on the screen and Kacie sounded out the words to herself, the MRI scanner recorded the underlying neural processes. If, for example, the process activated neurons in Broca’s area, fresh oxygenated blood would flow into this area and into each region connected to the neural network responsible for phonologic analysis. Within this circuit of actively <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70" title="70"/>firing neurons, newly arriving oxygenated blood was replacing oxygen-poor blood, and the scanner was recording it all. After the imaging was completed, Kacie was none the worse for wear (see Figure 18).</p>

Children and adults alike have embraced their brain images as if they had just been reunited with a long-lost and deeply mourned relative. As I point out the various normal anatomic structures, no matter how old our subject is, he literally lights up with wide-eyed amazement. If an adult, the remark is invariably “You may not believe this, but I always thought I was dumb and that my brain would look abnormal, with some parts missing or holes or something not right. I can’t believe I have a normal brain. What a relief.”</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>BASIC LANDMARKS OF THE BRAIN</b></h2>
			<p>The brain is an extraordinary organ, and for all its complexity in functioning, its organizing structure is relatively straightforward. I want to digress here briefly and point out some of the basic landmarks that I will refer to as we move forward.</p>
			<p class="indent">The brain is made up of two mirror-image sides, or hemispheres: right and left. As shown in Figure 19, the front of the brain, near the forehead, is referred to as <i>anterior,</i> and the back of the brain, behind the ears and further back, is called <i>posterior.</i> Each hemisphere of the brain is divided into four lobes or sections: <i>frontal, parietal, temporal,</i> and <i>occipital.</i> The frontal lobes are anterior, the occipital lobes posterior, and the parietal and temporal lobes somewhere in between. The parietal lobe sits above the temporal lobe. There are mirror-image lobes on each side of the brain—for example, the left temporal lobe and the right temporal lobe. Traditionally the left side of the brain has been associated with language.</p>
			<figure class="figure figure_medium_caption">
				<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72" title="72"/>
				<div class="squeeze squeeze50">
					<img alt="" class="image" id="Page_072_img01" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_072_Image_0001.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<figcaption class="figcaption dynamic_box">
					<p class="figcaption_para" id="fig-19"><i>Figure 19. Brain Landmarks</i></p>
					<p class="figcaption_para1">The left side of the brain is shown. The inset is an MRI image of the structures in the center of the brain; note the corpus callosum.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Connecting the left and right hemispheres is a broad band of tissue made up of the tails, or axons, of nerve cells, which busily carry messages from one hemisphere to the other. This band of connecting, insulated fibers is called the <i>corpus callosum</i> and on typical anatomic MRI images appears as a white band. In contrast, the brain cells that are the command center and originate the message are not insulated and appear as grey matter. If the right and left lobes are the vertical poles of the letter <i>H,</i> the corpus callosum is the horizontal band connecting the two sides. Finally, tucked beneath the occipital lobes is the <i>cerebellum</i>, the part of the brain that controls movement and coordination.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WATCHING THE BRAIN READ</b></h2>
			<p>Our initial functional imaging studies were focused on mapping out the neural circuitry for reading. Naturally, in planning our research, our first goal was to identify the neural pathways for breaking words into their underlying sounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73" title="73"/><span id="ftn-51"/>To begin we recruited a group of subjects, nineteen men and nineteen women, all of whom were good readers. To activate the circuitry for phonologic analysis, we asked our subjects to judge whether two nonsense words rhymed. After all the participants had been imaged, we examined the data and saw a surprising difference between the brain activation patterns in men and women (see Figure 20). As shown in the brain images, men activated the left inferior frontal gyrus, while women activated the right as well as the left; that is, while all nineteen men activated only the left side of the brain, most but not all women—eleven out of nineteen—showed activation on both sides of the brain (eight women activated only the left side). <span id="ftn-52"/>This represented the first demonstration of a visible sex difference in brain organization for language. Women performed the task as accurately and as quickly as men.</p>
			<p class="indent">Our discovery of sex differences in brain organization was exciting, but what most excited us was the identification of specific neural sites for sounding out words. The very same brain region that demonstrated sex differences, the inferior frontal gyrus, was also involved in reading. Having established <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74" title="74"/>to our satisfaction the feasibility of using fMRI to study reading, we felt comfortable proceeding to the next step: a series of studies that would begin to teach us, at the level of brain organization and function, why some very smart people have trouble reading.</p>

			<p class="indent">Progress in our understanding of the neurobiology of dyslexia over the past two decades has been breathtaking. <span id="ftn-53"/>First, the neural systems for reading in typical readers, both children and adults, have been mapped out. Next, and most important, careful examination of brain activation patterns reveals a glitch in this circuitry in dyslexic readers. Studies from around the world leave no doubt: Dyslexic readers use different brain pathways than good readers do.</p>
			<p class="indent">Good readers activate highly interconnected neural systems for reading, encompassing regions in the back and the front of the left side of the brain (see Figure 21). Not surprisingly, the reading circuitry includes brain regions dedicated to processing the visual features, that is, the lines and curves making up letters, to transforming the letters of the alphabet into the sounds of language and getting to the meaning of words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most of the reading brain is in the back (posterior) of the brain. The posterior reading system, as noted above, is made up of two distinct pathways for reading words, one sitting somewhat higher in the brain than the other. The upper pathway is located primarily in the middle of the brain (technically, the parieto-temporal region, or PT), just above and slightly behind the ear. The lower or occipito-temporal (OT) path runs closer to the bottom of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75" title="75"/>the brain; it is the site where two lobes of the brain, the occipital and the temporal, converge. One can envision this hectic region as a hub, a place in the brain where incoming information from different neural systems comes together and all the relevant information about a word—how it looks, how it sounds, and what it means—is tightly bound together. The OT circuit is barely beneath and somewhat in back of the ear, near the area where children often get swollen glands associated with scalp or ear infections.</p>

					<p class="figcaption_para" id="fig-21"><i>Figure 21. Brain Systems for Reading</i></p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Scientists have long focused on these areas as important in reading. <span id="ftn-54"/>As early as 1891, the great French neurologist Jules Dejerine suggested that the PT region was critical for reading, and just one year later he was also the first to link the OT area to reading. These two subsystems have different roles in reading. Their functions make sense in light of the changing needs of the reader: Beginning readers must first analyze a word; skilled readers identify a word virtually instantaneously. The PT system works for the novice reader. Slow and analytic, its function seems to be in the early stages of learning to read, that is, in initially analyzing a word, pulling it apart, and linking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76" title="76"/>its letters to their sounds. In contrast to the step-by-step PT system, the OT region is the express pathway to reading and is the one used by skilled readers. The more skilled the reader, the more she activates this region (see Figure 22). <span id="ftn-55"/>It responds very rapidly—in less than 150 <i>milliseconds</i> (less than a heartbeat)—to seeing a word. Instead of analyzing a word, the OT region reacts almost instantly to the whole word pattern. One brief glance and the word is automatically identified, on sight. Not surprisingly, the OT region is referred to as the visual <i>word form area.</i></p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>A NEUROBIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION OF HOW WE COME TO READ WORDS AUTOMATICALLY—AND HOW WE TEACH READING</b></h2>
			<p>The ability to simply glance at a word and be able to identify it quickly is the hallmark of mature, pleasurable reading. Such automatic reading is currently out of the reach of a dyslexic reader. The hope is that a better neurobiological understanding of how automatic reading develops will be the key to developing newer and better techniques for helping the dyslexic reader grasp the elusive brass ring of reading: becoming an automatic reader.</p>
			<p class="indent">Emerging brain imaging data have yielded an exciting new explanation of how automatic reading develops. These data present a powerful challenge to the prior theory that considered the left occipito-temporal region—the word form area—to function somewhat like a storage area for well-practiced words. Good evidence indicates that the left OT system is indeed critical for developing reading fluency. But in the original theory, investigators proposed that when an experienced reader comes across a word he has seen and read multiple times, the relevant neurons in the word form area become “tuned” to that word. As a result, the theory stipulates, the reader is then able to immediately match the printed word before him to the one stored in the word form area and instantly identify it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-56"/>This conceptualization has now been strongly challenged by a group of prominent British neuroscientists who have marshaled compelling evidence that the occipito-temporal region acts not as a storage area but rather as an “interactive” neural node where information from multiple inputs, including phonological (sound-based), orthographic (visual), and semantic (meaning-based), are integrated and synthesized. In this view, the neural mechanisms for the elements of reading (phonology, orthography, semantics) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77" title="77"/>are best conceptualized as distributed patterns of neural activity representing each of these elements. In other words, multiple neural pathways must be activated and then joined together.</p>
			<p class="indent">The controversy then is between whether the word is stored in toto, waiting to be recognized and identified (the old theory), or if this word form area functions more as a synthesizer or integrator, a neural node where all the critical parts or components making up the word are brought together (the new theory). That is, does rapid, fluent recognition of the word result from the word being read correctly over and over again, so that eventually the neurons in the word form area become tuned to the word and respond as if the word had been prefabricated and is immediately recognized, as the older theory proposes? Or is fluency for the word built up by experience, repeatedly bringing together and integrating the neural streams representing each of the three essential components of the reading process—orthography (how the word looks), phonology (how the word sounds), and semantics (what the word means)—as the interactive theory proposes, so that eventually this process takes place virtually instantaneously?</p>
			<p class="indent">At this time, the evidence indicates that it is the latter, the interactive theory, where the integration of the visual perception together with the speech sounds it represents and its meaning become bound together tighter and tighter and are recognized more quickly the more frequently the word is read <i>correctly.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">We think the word form integrative system works to build and support fluency in the following way: After a child has integrated the word components and <i>correctly</i> read a word several times, this integration process occurs more and more rapidly, so that the word is read virtually instantaneously. Subsequently, just seeing the word in print activates this primed process and the word is read fluently; that is, it all happens automatically, without conscious thought or effort.</p>
			<p class="indent">Recognition of the neural processes underlying skilled, fluent reading has important implications for how reading is taught, especially to struggling readers. Currently phonology (sounding out words) is often taught to the relative exclusion of other elements of reading. With these new data supporting the interactive theory, educators should now give serious thought to enlarging their perspective early on in the primary grades to include early exposure to words in context by having the children begin to read as early and as much as possible and stressing vocabulary as essential rather than ancillary in teaching children to read.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78" title="78"/>Mapping out the neural pathways in good readers opened the door to understanding the nature of the difficulty in dyslexic readers. As I said earlier, imaging studies revealed markedly different brain activation patterns in dyslexic readers compared to those in good readers. As they read, good readers activate the back of the brain, and also to some extent the front of the brain. In contrast, dyslexic readers show a fault in the system—inefficient functioning of neural pathways in the back of the brain. It is here, within these neural systems, that dyslexic readers have difficulty in integrating the major word components, which in turn interferes with their becoming fluent readers. Even as they mature they remain slow and not fluent readers.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>A NEURAL SIGNATURE FOR DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>Converging evidence from many laboratories around the world has now unequivocally demonstrated the “neural signature for dyslexia”—that is, an inefficient functioning of those reading systems in the back of the brain during reading (see Figure 23). This evidence from fMRI has for the first time made visible what previously was a hidden disability. For example, in one of the first studies of fMRI in dyslexia, we used fMRI to study 144 children, approximately half of whom had dyslexia and half of whom were typical readers. Results obtained during a task requiring phonologic analysis indicated significantly greater activation in posterior reading systems in typical readers than in readers with dyslexia. These findings align with the classic nineteenth-century reports by Dejerine I mentioned earlier, which describe neural systems affected in adults who had a sudden loss of the ability to read (acquired alexia), for example, following a stroke.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-57"/>These data from fMRI studies in groups of children with dyslexia have been replicated in reports from many investigators and show a failure of left hemisphere posterior brain systems to function properly during reading, particularly the systems in the left hemisphere occipito-temporal region. (See Figure 24.) <span id="ftn-58"/>Similar findings have been reported in German and Italian readers with dyslexia. <span id="ftn-59"/>Some studies in Chinese readers with dyslexia show brain abnormalities in left occipito-temporal and anterior frontal regions similar to those found in dyslexia in alphabetic writing systems.</p>
			<p class="indent">These findings are helping us understand the roots of dyslexia. For example, we observed the inefficient functioning in young children indicating that the wiring glitch is present from the <i>start of reading</i> and does not represent the end result of years of poor reading. The identical posterior dysfunction is observed in children and in adults, neurobiological proof that reading problems don’t go away. They are persistent, and now we better understand why. We have also learned that dyslexic children and adults turn to alternate, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80" title="80"/>compensatory reading systems. Brain images recorded as dyslexic readers try to sound out words show the posterior system on the left side of the brain is not working efficiently; instead these slow but accurate readers are relying on alternate, secondary pathways—not a repair but a different route to reading. In addition to their greater reliance on frontal systems (Broca’s area), dyslexics are using other auxiliary systems for reading, ones located on the <i>right</i> side and also in the <i>front</i> of the brain on the left—a functioning system but, alas, not an automatic one (see Figure 25).</p>
			<figure class="figure figure_medium_caption">

			</figure>
			<p class="indent">These findings now explain the previously puzzling picture of bright adult dyslexic readers who improve in reading words accurately but for whom reading remains slow and draining. The dysfunction in left posterior systems prevents rapid, automatic word recognition; the development of ancillary (right side frontal and posterior as well as left frontal) systems allows for accurate, albeit very slow, reading. These dyslexic readers have to rely on a <i>manual</i> rather than on an automatic system for reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">Taken together, these studies from investigators in different laboratories and examining different languages demonstrate unequivocally not only inefficient functioning of the occipito-temporal system for skilled reading, but now for the first time provide the neurobiological explanation for the dyslexic reader’s slow reading.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81" title="81"/><b>BRAIN IMAGING IN PREREADERS AND EARLY READERS</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-60"/>When does the neural signature for dyslexia develop? Do these changes in brain function and organization predate the poor reading, or are they the result of poor reading itself? In a series of experiments, Nadine Gaab at Boston Children’s Hospital and John Gabrieli at the McGovern Institute at MIT addressed just these questions. While preschool children performed a phonological task, Dr. Gaab compared functional brain images in those with a family history of dyslexia to peers without a family history of dyslexia. Results showed that as a group, the preschoolers with a family history of dyslexia demonstrated reduced activation in posterior reading systems. In a separate study, Dr. Gabrieli and his associates examined the white-matter (nerve fiber) connections in kindergarten children who had not yet been taught to read. Results showed a larger volume and higher integrity of white matter in the left arcuate fasiculus (the large white-matter tract connecting two reading systems, the left anterior language system in Broca’s area with posterior language systems in the temporal and parietal areas) in those children with the best phonological awareness. The findings of both studies suggest that the differences in brain function and structure are present even before the children learn to read.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> These findings must be viewed cautiously, because those conducting both studies did not know if the children would develop dyslexia or not. For example, in the study by Dr. Gaab, while children with a family history of dyslexia are at higher risk for dyslexia, many children with a family history never develop dyslexia, while some who lack any known family history are eventually identified as dyslexic. Future studies should clarify these issues.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>BRAIN CHATTER: NEW DATA REVEAL HOW BRAIN SYSTEMS FOR READING COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER</b></h2>
			<p>
				The initial challenge in the elucidation of the neural basis of reading and dyslexia was identifying the specific regions of the brain involved in reading. Once that was accomplished, we moved on to the next important question, one that involves <i>function:</i> How do the key systems in reading communicate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82" title="82"/>with one another, how are they <i>connected,</i> and are there differences in connectivity between good and struggling readers?</p>
			<p class="indent">Connectivity analyses of fMRI data represent the most recent evolution in characterizing brain networks in dyslexia. Measures of functional connectivity are designed to detect interesting differences in brain regions which, although they have <i>similar magnitudes of activation,</i> demonstrate <i>differences</i> in how this is synchronized with other brain systems in dyslexic and typical readers.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-61"/>In fact, this synchrony between anatomically distinct regions might be equally as or more important for cognitive performance than the magnitude of activation in any single region. <span id="ftn-62"/>Although there have been some functional connectivity studies of dyslexia, these have examined connections between just a few specific regions and potentially fail to provide a full, complete picture of the connectivity profiles of dyslexic compared to typical readers. For example, one recent study examined differences between readers with dyslexia and typical readers in the connectivity of the visual word form area (VWFA) and other components of the reading system. In typical readers, the VWFA was connected to distant as well as adjacent reading systems in the left and right hemispheres. In contrast, functional connectivity in dyslexic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83" title="83"/>readers was significantly reduced to primarily adjacent areas in the left VWFA (see Figure 26).</p>

			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-63"/>Rather than examining connectivity between two or three arbitrarily chosen brain regions, we studied connectivity patterns in typical compared to dyslexic readers across the <i>entire</i> brain. Based on a large group of seventy-five children, we found that compared to typical readers, in dyslexic readers brain connectivity to the word form area (critical to reading fluency) is disrupted. Connectivity is also disrupted between neural systems for reading and those for attention.</p>
			<p class="indent">The brain’s reliance on patterns of connectivity may have particular relevance to the teaching of reading, since within these systems patterns of neural connections are continually reinforced and strengthened as a result of repeated reading practice and reading experiences. We can then imagine that each time a six-year-old is able to associate a letter with a particular sound, the neural pathways responsible for making this linkage are further reinforced and even more deeply imprinted within her brain.</p>
			<p class="indent">With these studies, the science of dyslexia has taken a major leap forward, progressing from talking about the location of isolated processors in the brain to a much more dynamic and meaningful accounting of a neural network of interconnected, interactive brain systems for reading in typical readers compared to disruptions in the connectivity in dyslexic readers.</p>

			<p>
				For almost two decades the central dogma in reading research has been that the generation of the phonological code from print is modular, that is, automatic, not attention-demanding and not requiring any other cognitive process. <span id="ftn-64"/>New findings, including recent imaging studies, now suggest that attentional mechanisms may also play an important role in reading and dyslexia. For example, compared to typical readers, children with dyslexia failed to recruit an area in the front of the brain (technically referred to as the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) during a phonological task (see Figure 27).</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-65"/>This region has long been known to play an important role in attention, and this study demonstrated that when asked to rhyme words they heard, typical children activated the region while children with dyslexia did not. Active work now taking place in our laboratory is examining the long-sought neurobiological relationship between reading and attention (to be discussed later).</p>

			<p>Think again—no you don’t!</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> As a scientist, I am truly excited to see the responsible neurons coming online and communicating with one another to produce reading. But this leads to the question that I am asked over and over again: “Can you image my child’s brain to see if he is dyslexic?” I can even recall a physician who came to see me. “I must have my brain imaged,” he blurted out with great anxiety. “The images are so compelling and I want to see what my brain looks like as I read. Do I have the usual changes seen in dyslexic people? It would be wonderful to see my brain in action and finally settle the question of my dyslexia. I have been diagnosed as dyslexic and I seem to have all the symptoms, but it still would be quite special to see my working brain read.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Yes, I agree it would be spectacular for that child or parent to be able to undergo functional brain imaging and see the source of the problem, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85" title="85"/>but as a responsible neuroscientist and clinician, <i>I must recommend that you neither request nor undergo fMRI to diagnose your or your child’s dyslexia.</i> This procedure is simply not ready to be used clinically. Why? In carrying out research, we image <i>groups</i> of individuals and analyze the fMRI activation patterns based on <i>group</i> results. Although we and others are working toward obtaining reliable results based on a single person, there is just too much variability within each individual and across individuals to provide a reliable interpretation based on a single person. My advice to you at this time is not to look to brain imaging to diagnose dyslexia, as tempting as it may be. Such a procedure has as much chance of providing incorrect information as it does of being correct. The good news, however, is that with the deep understanding of dyslexia that now exists, dyslexia can be reliably diagnosed clinically based on a synthesis of an individual’s history, symptoms, observations of the person speaking and reading, and test measures.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</b></h2>
			<p>Because I’ve covered so much ground so far and some of it has been scientifically demanding, let me summarize what we’ve learned.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reading is a code, and no matter who we are, each of us must somehow represent print as a neural code that the brain can decipher. Functional imaging makes this process transparent, allowing scientists to watch (and record) the neural systems at work as children and adults attempt to transcribe letters into sounds. For most people this process is incredibly quick and smooth; it’s effortless. For others it’s an entirely different story. Imaging provides the neurobiological—the physical—evidence of the difficulties dyslexic readers have in transforming this written code into the linguistic code that is the key to reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">Seeing these images leaves no doubt that the core problem in dyslexia is phonologic—turning print into sound. Neuroscientists now have the holy grail that we have been searching for since Pringle Morgan first introduced us to Percy F.: the basic foundation for a neural explanation for the understanding of dyslexia. Now that we have the growing ability to pinpoint the complex neural networks that serve reading, our quest to understand dyslexia has taken a quantum leap forward. Having identified the neural networks engaged by reading and having pinpointed the anatomic location of the glitch in dyslexia, we are now probing deeper within these systems, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86" title="86"/>examining the network of connections in typical compared to dyslexic readers.</p>
			<p class="indent">As I said earlier, dyslexia is a “hidden disability,” and skeptics have tried to explain it away. But at long last, thanks to functional imaging, dyslexic readers have the proof they have been seeking. These remarkable images provide concrete evidence of the physical reality of their reading difficulty. They also explain how adolescent and young adult dyslexic readers can read accurately but slowly. Meanwhile, it is now possible to use what we have learned about the basic phonologic weakness and growing evidence of the important role of attention, along with dyslexic readers’ substantial strengths, to provide better solutions for them.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>MAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES WORK FOR YOU</b></h2>
			<p>
				The new science of reading has direct application to diagnosing and treating dyslexia: It allows us to spot early warning signs of a reading problem, to know what specific clues to look for at any age, and to understand which are the most scientifically sound approaches to teaching reading. The science happily dovetails with practical everyday needs. This knowledge can be used to answer virtually all the common questions concerning dyslexia. The possibilities for someone with dyslexia are just about limitless; the potential for success and for a happy, fulfilling life is greater than ever before. Applying all that we now know allows virtually every dyslexic child to dare to dream. The very good news is that our <i>knowledge gap is closing</i>; the frustrating news is that this has been replaced by <i>an action gap</i>—that is, we, especially schools and policymakers, are way behind in translating the existing scientific progress into policy and practice.</p>
			<p class="indent">The greatest stumbling block preventing a dyslexic child from realizing her potential is widespread ignorance about the true nature of dyslexia. The remainder of this book is devoted to eradicating this ignorance by applying scientific knowledge to the diagnosis and management of dyslexia. We can do it. We must do it.</p>
