			<p>As common as reading problems are, and as much as we have learned about them, the diagnosis of dyslexia is often missed. Take the experience of one of my colleagues, Juliet, in her own words, talking about her son.</p>

				<p>
					I would say that from the beginning we were always expecting Andrew to read. When he was four, he would sit with us for hours at a time and listen to us read <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and even show a glimmer of interest in <i>Harry Potter.</i> We knew he was interested in books and he had a great attention span for listening to books. So we just knew as soon as he got to school, reading was going to take off. That didn’t happen. Actually, in kindergarten other kids were reading and Andrew wasn’t. And in first grade I’d meet with his teacher, and she’d say, “Well, he’s not where we expect him to be, but it clicks in for everyone at a different time, and it’ll click in for him.” She was a veteran teacher and well respected. So I thought, <i>What do I know?</i> But Andrew knew. And I said, “You read much better than you did in kindergarten.” And he said, “But I read like a kindergartner.” He knew that I was trying to put one over on him. The school did some cursory testing and they said, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158" title="158"/>“Yeah, somewhat behind in the reading, but not enough to worry about. He’ll be fine.” Andrew was very bright, and he was reading very poorly, especially in relation to his very superior intelligence. Things did not improve as he went from one grade to another. But he had dyslexia, which they didn’t get at all; they told me that they didn’t believe in dyslexia. What frustrated him the most was that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t do what the other kids were doing. And so Andrew, who couldn’t wait to start school and become a reader, instead became one of those class clown kind of kids.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">There were enough clues in Andrew’s early reading struggles, as well as the demonstration of a large gap between his high intelligence and his poor reading, to tell us that Andrew warranted a full evaluation for dyslexia. Alas, tens of thousands of children who are struggling to read and have clinical symptoms of dyslexia are going undiagnosed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-92"/>Today’s evaluation for dyslexia puts into practice all that we have learned about reading and dyslexia. It is focused, it follows a structure, and it reflects a scientific rationale.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DYSLEXIA IS “UNEXPECTED”</b></h2>
			<p>
				For the last hundred years, perhaps the most consistent and enduring core of the definition of dyslexia is the concept of <i>unexpected</i> underachievement. The construct of unexpected underachievement refers to a child whose reading is unexpectedly low in relation to his or her intelligence. <span id="ftn-93"/>This unexpected nature of dyslexia, as you’ll remember, was originally described by Dr. Pringle Morgan in his patient Percy F., the first published description of dyslexia. The unexpected nature of dyslexia has been scientifically validated in a 2010 report published in the journal <i>Psychological Science,</i> and that scientific finding has now been translated into federal law—specifically, in the First Step Act (Public Law 115-391), which I referred to earlier.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DYSLEXIA IS A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS</b></h2>
			<p>
				It’s important to consider each of the components of the diagnostic puzzle: what each component contributes and how to synthesize all the pieces to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159" title="159"/>arrive at a diagnosis. Current practice recognizes that dyslexia is a clinical diagnosis, based on clinical judgment, made by an experienced clinician who considers both the individual’s history and symptoms and his or her learning profile, including cognitive and achievement abilities that may point to an unexpected difficulty in reading as well as the reasons for this difficulty. In this schema, reading below intellectual ability, sometimes referred to as an ability-achievement discrepancy, is just one component of an overall clinical assessment, one that considers, for example, a person’s history and observation of the person speaking and reading aloud as well as the results of testing.</p>
			<p class="indent">While tests are helpful, they are only one component, albeit an important one, of the evaluation process. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor understands this. Prior to her tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Sotomayor served as a U.S. District Court judge for the Southern District of New York State. In this role, presiding over a trial involving a dyslexic attorney’s suit charging the New York State Bar with discrimination for denying the plaintiff’s request for accommodations, Justice Sotomayor astutely made these remarks concerning the diagnosis of dyslexia: “By its very nature, diagnosing a learning disability requires clinical judgment…not quantifiable merely by test scores.” Test scores from psychometric measures are not necessarily sufficient to establish the presence or absence of dyslexia. Instead, knowledge of the individual’s history, clinical observations, behavioral observations, and judgment are essential to a diagnosis.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c12-ftn-1" id="c12-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*1</a></sup> Dyslexia is neither diagnosed nor accurately represented by a single score on a test; it is identified best by consideration of a broader clinical picture conforming to the known characteristics of the disorder. This makes it imperative that educators and evaluators become more deeply knowledgeable about dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">To repeat, the most consistent and enduring core of the definition is the concept of dyslexia as <i>unexpected</i> underachievement. The evaluation follows the universal definition of dyslexia, which describes its typical impact on several areas, including speaking (word retrieval), reading (accuracy and fluency), spelling, and learning a second language.</p>
			<p class="indent">Today’s scientifically based evaluation of dyslexia is <i>organic.</i> It reflects the actual experiences dyslexic children and their families have endured. Wise clinicians appreciate that tests are only approximations of the reality that is the individual’s life experience. In fact, the tests that are ultimately selected must be chosen with great care. An evaluation must be tailored to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160" title="160"/>the individual so that it reflects the expression of problems appropriate to that person’s age and education.</p>
			<p class="indent">The diagnosis of dyslexia is basically no different than that for any other condition. Guided by knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology, the clinician seeks to determine through history, observation, and psychometric assessment if there is evidence to support a diagnosis of dyslexia. The three steps of the evaluation process are to</p>

				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>gather evidence supporting its “unexpectedness” (high learning capability may be determined on the basis of an intelligence test).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>demonstrate evidence of a phonologic weakness, with other higher-level language functions relatively unaffected.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">There is no one single test score that makes the diagnosis of dyslexia. As with any other scientifically based diagnosis, the diagnosis of dyslexia should reflect a thoughtful synthesis of all the clinical data available. What the clinician is seeking is converging evidence of a phonologically based reading disability as indicated by a disparity between the individual’s reading and phonologic skills, on the one hand, and his intellectual capabilities or age, on the other. Dyslexia is distinguished from other disorders that may prominently feature reading difficulties by the unique, circumscribed nature of the phonologic deficit, one not generally intruding into other linguistic or cognitive domains.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finding reading scores that are unexpectedly low for age or intelligence is the first step in the diagnosis of dyslexia. Reading tests are easy to understand once you recall that there are two major components of reading: <i>decoding</i> (identifying words) and <i>comprehension</i> (understanding what is read). Accordingly, the assessment focuses on how well the child reads words and on how well she understands what she has read.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the school-age child, reading is assessed by measuring accuracy, fluency, and comprehension. While accuracy is critical early on, the ability to read fluently gains in importance as the child matures. <i>A child who reads accurately but not fluently is dyslexic.</i> One important element of the evaluation is how accurately the child can decode words (that is, read single words). <span id="ftn-94"/>This is measured with standardized untimed tests of single real word and pseudoword <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161" title="161"/>reading, such as the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement-IV (WJ-IV). In addition, the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-III (WIAT-III) and the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement III (KTEA-III) are reliable, valid, and comprehensive measures of academic achievement. Each test includes multiple tasks designed to evaluate early reading skills, such as letter identification, word reading, pseudoword decoding, fluency, and comprehension.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>READING REAL SINGLE WORDS</b></h3>
			<p>
				In a young school-age child like Andrew, the reading evaluation first determines how accurately he can decode words—that is, read single words in isolation. For example, Andrew was asked to read increasingly difficult words, going from <i>go, the,</i> and <i>me</i> to words like <i>pioneer, inquire,</i> and <i>wealth,</i> and finally to the most complex: <i>epigraphist, facetious,</i> and <i>shillegah.</i></p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>READING PSEUDOWORDS</b></h3>
			<p>
				Even more central to the diagnosis of dyslexia is how Andrew reads so-called pseudowords or made-up words—words he has never seen before and could not have memorized. We might begin with <i>ree, ip,</i> and <i>din.</i> The words increase in difficulty to <i>rejune, depine,</i> and <i>viv,</i> and then to the most challenging of all, <i>pnir, ceisminadolt,</i> and <i>byrcal.</i> The point of these strange but pronounceable words is that they test a child’s ability to <i>sound out words</i>—to map letters to sounds. Each word can be sounded out if you have acquired <i>phonologic decoding</i> ability. <i>The ability to read nonsense words is one of the best measures of phonologic decoding skill in children.</i> Reading tests often refer to this skill as <i>word attack.</i> The reader literally has to penetrate the sound structure of the word and sound it out, phoneme by phoneme; there is no other way. Most children generally reach their full capacity to sound out nonsense words by adolescence.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>READING FLUENCY</b></h3>
			<p>
				Reading fluency, or the ability to read accurately, rapidly, and with good prosody, is of critical importance because it allows for the automatic, attention-free recognition of words. <span id="ftn-95"/>The Test of Word Reading Efficiency, second edition (TOWRE-2), assesses how accurately and how quickly someone reads single words and pseudowords. This is helpful, but it does not measure true fluency, which is based on reading <i>connected</i> text aloud and demonstrating <i>understanding</i> of what is being read.</p>
			<p class="indent">Tests of oral reading fluency—reading passages aloud—are often particularly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162" title="162"/>helpful in identifying any uncertainties a child may have in decoding a word. By its very nature, oral reading forces the reader to pronounce each word. Listening to a dyslexic reader as she painfully tries to decode one word after another leaves no doubt about her reading ability. We can observe how much effort it requires for her to pronounce each syllable of each word; we can hear words that are mangled or newly made up; we can note that some words that should be there are not; we can note the lack of cadence or inflection in her reading. We can thus identify a struggling reader who still has not fully mastered the connection between letters and sounds. As you know by now, such labored oral reading can be a telltale sign of dyslexia in an otherwise extremely gifted and accomplished person.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-96"/>Oral reading fluency is generally assessed by asking the child to read <i>aloud</i> using the Gray Oral Reading Test fifth edition (GORT-5). This test consists of increasingly difficult passages, each followed by comprehension questions; scores are awarded for accuracy, rate, fluency, and comprehension. As you listen to the dyslexic child read and then review his scores, you will often see that as he attempts to read more quickly, his accuracy dips. This is because he is a manual rather than an automatic reader.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the ability to read words accurately and rapidly is often the focus of measures of fluency, it is critical to understand that a major, if not the most important, component of the definition of fluency is <i>prosody</i>—that is, reading with <i>understanding.</i> So listening to how the person reads connected text out loud—listening for how she modifies her voice reflecting the content or emotion of what is being read—is an essential part of the assessment of fluency.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>SPELLING</b></h3>
			<p>
				Children who have difficulty reading typically struggle with spelling—encoding the words, that is, converting the sounds into letters. <span id="ftn-97"/>Helpful spelling tests include the Test of Written Spelling-5, the WIAT-III, KTEA-III, and WJ-IV, which includes spelling as one of the skills measured on its Written Language subtest.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>COGNITIVE ABILITY</b></h3>
			<p><span id="ftn-98"/>Because dyslexia is defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading in a child or adult in relation to intelligence, it is not surprising that a measure of intelligence such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children fifth edition (WISC-V) is an important component of a comprehensive assessment of the child or adult with dyslexia. Very often an IQ test can reveal areas of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163" title="163"/><i>strength,</i> particularly in areas of abstract thinking and reasoning, which are very reassuring to parents and especially to the child herself. It also indicates that the reading difficulty is isolated and not reflective of a general lack of learning ability.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>HELPFUL HINT:</i> I want to reemphasize that following completion of the testing and scoring of a test of intelligence, <i>it is essential to engage in a dialogue with the child or adult about his ability, asking him where on the bell-shaped curve he believes his intelligence lies and then indicating to him where it actually lies—typically significantly higher than he indicated.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 class="head"><b>READING COMPREHENSION</b></h3>
			<p>
				In contrast to decoding and fluency, reading comprehension, as Andrew demonstrated, is often minimally affected in bright children with dyslexia, if at all. Tests of reading comprehension are generally, but not always, read silently. Accordingly, someone’s score on such a test depends less on the accurate pronunciation of each word than on her being able to infer the meaning of the passage in order to answer questions based on it. She can use the context to guess at the meaning of some words and still answer the comprehension questions correctly. For example, if Andrew cannot read the word <i>giraffe</i> or pronounce it, he can still guess at its meaning by reading the words preceding it: “A tall animal with a very long neck is called a giraffe.” Tests of reading comprehension are included on the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement, Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement, and the Test of Reading Comprehension fourth edition (c). As a result, dyslexic readers (permitted sufficient time) often do better on tests of reading comprehension than on measures that ask them to decode isolated single words.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are instances reflecting a range of issues, including anxiety or extremely poor decoding, when a child will perform poorly on a test of comprehension. Yet when comprehension is examined in more depth—for example, when the child is given a test such as the TORC-4—he performs well on many of the subtests of comprehension and would not be considered to have poor comprehension.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> If a child has major problems in reading comprehension, he or she should be diagnosed not as dyslexic but rather as having a reading comprehension problem—Specific-Reading Comprehension Deficit (S-RCD).</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164" title="164"/>After a child is evaluated, we know exactly what pattern to look for in the test results to diagnose dyslexia (we look for both accuracy and effort required by reading):</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">I mentioned earlier how a phonologic weakness and strengths in thinking and reasoning can be recognized. For example, parents can often observe problems with rhyming or with pronouncing words, or, as with Andrew, difficulty in retrieving words, having words on the tip of his tongue and not being able to pull them out.</p>
			<p class="indent">Phonologic skills can be directly and reliably measured in a school-age child. <span id="ftn-99"/>The Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, second edition (CTOPP-2), assesses a particularly broad array. One specific kind of phonologic test that is quite sensitive to dyslexia in children asks a child to pull apart a word and then to delete a specific phoneme. Not surprisingly, this is called a phoneme deletion (or elision) test. The examiner asks the child, “Can you say <i>sour</i> without the <i>sss</i>?” (<i>Our.</i>) “Can you say <i>crane</i> without the <i>r</i>?” (<i>Cane.</i>) Children who cannot break apart spoken words into phonemes will not be able to link letters to sounds.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>VOCABULARY</b></h3>
			<p>
				A child’s vocabulary—his familiarity with the meanings of a range of common and uncommon words—provides a good index of his general language skills. <span id="ftn-100"/>In the most commonly used test, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165" title="165"/>fifth edition (PPVT-V), he is asked to point to which one of four pictures shows, for example, a <i>giant,</i> a <i>canoe,</i> a <i>mammoth,</i> or an <i>equestrian.</i> This test, which does not require a verbal response, is often especially informative for dyslexic children, who may instantly point to the correct picture but have difficulty retrieving the specific name if a spoken response is called for.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE SYNTHESIS</b></h2>
			<p>Once Andrew had completed his evaluation, we examined all the information: what his parents (and teachers and Andrew himself) had told us about his development and school history; what his evaluator observed during her interactions with him; and what his pattern of performance on tests of phonology, reading, spelling, vocabulary, and intelligence told us about how Andrew reads. In each of these elements we looked for evidence of a reading problem, of intact higher-level thinking and language skills, and of a phonologic difficulty.</p>
			<p class="indent">Andrew struggled to read words. He experienced the most problems in trying to sound out nonsense words. He was able to pronounce only the first few words, performing at the level of a first-grader. In addition to his difficulties deciphering isolated words, Andrew labored over reading passages out loud. He read the stories very slowly and haltingly as he tried to decode the words. Sometimes he would skip two lines and not seem to notice. In oral reading, Andrew scored dismally. Clearly, he was not a fluent reader. In contrast, as his mom had predicted, he scored much higher on a test of reading comprehension based on silent reading. Andrew’s high learning capability was evident.</p>
			<p class="indent">His parents (and grandmother) told us about his development: They described a bright, highly inquisitive, creative child who constantly wanted to know <i>why,</i> who put together two-hundred-piece puzzles himself, who spent hours looking at the globe and identifying different countries by their shapes, and who especially loved to be read to. Andrew could listen to <i>Harry Potter</i> and stories from Greek mythology over and over again. His teachers corroborated these accounts with their observations of his performance in class, in listening to stories and absorbing even the most abstract and subtle points. Andrew’s ability to understand what he heard and his ability to read were, according to his teacher, “like day and night.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Although not a good reader, Andrew was apparently an excellent thinker. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166" title="166"/>This was clearly evident in the results of his IQ test, where he scored at the ninety-fifth percentile. His performance on tests to get to the sounds of words was the exact opposite. On the phoneme deletion test Andrew could not seem to pull apart the sticky phonemes in the test words. To Andrew, a word was a solid, impenetrable whole. There was no question that he had a phonologic weakness.</p>
			<p class="indent">On the PPVT-V test, where he could point to pictures of words, Andrew performed in the superior range. Dyslexics often have surprisingly large vocabularies. Andrew was able to demonstrate this. Since he did not have to summon up the word itself and say it, he was not penalized by his phonologic difficulty in retrieving words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Timed and untimed measures of reading, including tests of reading accuracy (regular and nonsense words) and fluency, reading comprehension, spelling, phonology, vocabulary, arithmetic, and cognitive ability represent a basic core battery for the diagnosis of dyslexia in school-age children. Of course, additional tests of academic achievement in arithmetic, language, writing, or memory may be administered as part of a more comprehensive evaluation. If a child performs much better on a test of math concepts, say, than on reading, that adds to the impression of an isolated reading deficit in the context of other well-developed academic abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent">Keep in mind that at times dyslexic children experience difficulty with remembering the names of numbers, in memorizing multiplication tables, or sometimes in reading word problems. This should not be confused with the child having a basic problem in mathematical ability. Later you will read about a highly regarded dyslexic economist who experienced these difficulties in her early school years and then went on to develop widely admired complex economic mathematical models.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> There is no one single test score that ensures a diagnosis of dyslexia. It is the overall picture that matters. An extremely bright child who has a reading score in the average range but who struggles and cannot learn to read fluently, and who has all the signs just described for dyslexia, has dyslexia.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">This pattern is so consistent and so replicable among dyslexic readers that the approach I have described should ensure that each struggling reader is identified before he endures years of frustration and failure. Keep in mind, as Justice Sotomayor said, that dyslexia is a clinical diagnosis and there is no ceiling score, a number below which a person must score to be considered <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" title="167"/>dyslexic. As I will describe later, as the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act of 2008 regulations indicate, the critical determinant is <i>how</i> the person reads, technically referred to as the <i>condition, manner, or duration</i> of <i>how</i> he or she reads. Is it with great effort, stumbling, skipping words, mispronouncing, or reading incredibly slowly? These factors of <i>how</i> the person reads must be given primacy.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> There are infrequent instances when older children, often very bright boys and girls who have received large doses of intensive code-based reading interventions, such as programs using the Orton-Gillingham approach (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c21_r1.xhtml#page_287">this page</a>), will perform surprisingly well on, for example, tests of phonological processing such as the CTOPP-2 but are still not fluent readers. Most likely the lack of fluency reflects lack of practice applying their newly learned phonologic skills through reading lots of material. In other words, these children have the basic skills but haven’t honed them through reading practice.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Disorders other than dyslexia may affect reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">In <i>developmental dyslexia,</i> the phonologic weakness is primary; other components of the language system are virtually intact, and the reading impairment is at the level of decoding the single word, initially accurately and later reading connected text fluently. Intelligence is not affected and may be in the superior or gifted range. The disorder is present from birth and not acquired.</p>
			<p class="indent">In <i>language-learning disability,</i> the primary deficit involves multiple aspects of language, including both the sounds and the meanings of words. Here the reading difficulty is at the level of both decoding and comprehension, and language difficulties of all sorts are prominent. Measures of verbal intelligence are significantly affected by language deficits, and intelligence may be in the subaverage range. People are born with the disorder.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c12-ftn-2" id="c12-ftn2" role="doc-noteref">*2</a></sup></p>
			<p class="indent">In <i>acquired alexia,</i> there is a loss or a diminution of reading ability resulting from brain trauma, a tumor, or a stroke affecting the brain systems necessary for reading. There may be other accompanying symptoms, such as loss of speech or weakness on the right side of the body, depending on the exact region affected by the injury to the brain. In contrast to developmental <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168" title="168"/>dyslexia, this disorder is acquired and is most often observed in middle-aged or elderly men and women.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Hyperlexia</i> is a relatively rare disorder whose cause is unknown. In many ways it is the mirror image of dyslexia. Children who are born hyperlexic learn to decode words very early, sometimes even as toddlers or preschoolers. They show an early and intense interest in words and letters, and their exceptional word-recognition ability is often apparent by the age of five. In contrast, they have extremely poor reading comprehension. There are deficits in reasoning and abstract problem-solving. Not infrequently, affected children have difficulties forming relationships with other children as well as adults.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is also important in diagnosing dyslexia to eliminate other potential contributing factors in school-age children who struggle to read. Children should be evaluated for hearing or vision problems. At one time it was thought that subtle hearing problems resulting from chronic ear infections might interfere with the acquisition of language and later with reading, but the most recent evidence indicates that is not true. There is also a scarcity of hard scientific evidence to support the notion that problems relating to the ability of eye muscles to converge cause reading difficulty.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are some tests that are <i>unnecessary</i> in the evaluation of dyslexia—for example, laboratory measures such as imaging studies (MRIs, CT scans, X-rays), electroencephalograms (EEGs), and genetic studies. These tests should be prescribed only if there are specific clinical indications <i>other</i> than dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many people confuse attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Some even use the two terms interchangeably. ADHD and dyslexia are two distinct conditions. (See <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c30_r1.xhtml#page_419">this page</a> for more details.) Dyslexia, as you know by now, is a disorder reflecting a difficulty accessing the sounds of spoken language. ADHD is a problem reflecting difficulties allocating, focusing, and sustaining attention. Lack of automatic (fluent) reading may drain attentional resources, resulting in the dyslexic reader appearing inattentive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dyslexia is one of a small group of public health problems that we have the ability to reliably screen for and detect early on and effectively treat. We must ensure that each child who is not learning to read in the first year or so of school is identified and treated. It is now possible to minimize the negative impact of dyslexia, but in order to do so such children must first be identified. As I’ve said, the earlier the diagnosis is made, the better the results are. This is why I now want to turn our attention to the question of evaluating younger children for the very first signs of a reading problem.</p>
