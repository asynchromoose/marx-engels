			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>DIAGNOSING DYSLEXIA—WHY, WHAT, AND HOW</b></h1>
			<p>Given the solid science behind dyslexia, its diagnosis should be straightforward and readily obtainable. Yet this necessary first step in getting help for a struggling child (or adult) is far too often and unnecessarily elusive. Of the mountains of requests for help I receive, obtaining a valid diagnosis for a child reigns as the top concern. It need not be this way.</p>
			<p class="indent">I want to share with you, from the broadest perspective, the newest information about how best to conceptualize dyslexia, the great value of obtaining a diagnosis of dyslexia, and how some of the sharpest dyslexic minds view dyslexia. Dyslexia will take on new meaning for you when you understand how the scientific discoveries pinpointing the origin of the difficulties it causes allow you to know which symptoms to look for and to understand why and how they cause your child’s or your own difficulties. It will all fall into place as you read about the paradox of slow reading and quick thinking that is dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Indeed, a very large and often misunderstood and overlooked segment of the dyslexic population is the child who is both bright—often gifted—and dyslexic (sometimes referred to as 2e, meaning twice exceptional). Can this be—a struggling reader and a swift thinker? Yes, it can. Learning about the latest scientific data should end any doubts about dyslexia as an <i>unexpected</i> difficulty characterized by the frequent co-occurrence of high IQ and surprisingly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90" title="90"/>slow reading. For far too long, very bright children and young adults have been discriminated against in being denied a diagnosis of dyslexia and, later on, accommodations for high-stakes standardized tests. We now have the highest level of scientific evidence that should rightfully put an end to this misguided policy and support the diagnosis and accommodations that make such a difference to these boys and girls who are so full of potential. I will begin with the essentials making up the big picture or main idea of dyslexia and then fill in with more specific details.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DIAGNOSIS: THE ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP</b></h2>
			<p>A diagnosis is akin to finding the key to unlock a mystery. It puts the pieces together, explains so many puzzling aspects or seeming contradictions often noted in your child, and gives a direction. Once you know the diagnosis, you will know what you and educators can do to make the most positive difference. A diagnosis is specific and definitive, reflecting a synthesis of the best scientific knowledge and the characteristics of your child. Failure to receive a diagnosis tops the list of practices harmful to a dyslexic child. There should be no difficulty in obtaining one. But there are potential pitfalls.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> A great concern is the well-intentioned, albeit misinformed, recent tendency by some evaluators to list the child’s performance on various neuropsychological tests but neglect to synthesize these, where appropriate, into a specific diagnosis of dyslexia.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">It is important to understand the difference between a child receiving a specific diagnosis of dyslexia and getting a report that simply lists an array of your child’s strengths and weaknesses. Some parents describe this experience as akin to reading a mystery novel in which the last chapter, the denouement—the resolution—has been omitted. A great many parents have asked me to look at their child’s evaluation following such an approach. When I am handed a document of more than thirty pages without a diagnosis—it happens often—I feel for those parents, and I find such reports incredibly disappointing. It doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Twelve-year-old Olivia was given a listing of the <i>pieces</i>—that is, the processes—in which she did well and those in which she struggled. When <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91" title="91"/>asked what she could surmise from the report, she could only regurgitate: “I have problems with auditory processing, processing speed, rapid naming, working memory, letter-word identification, pseudoword decoding, and reading fluency. Oh, and I do better in comprehension, long-term retrieval, fluid intelligence, and visual-spatial processing.” Olivia was essentially saying that she had no idea what she was talking about.</p>
			<p class="indent">But when these pieces were synthesized into a coherent whole, a diagnosis of dyslexia, her response represented notable progress: “I am dyslexic. Nothing about me has changed, only now I understand what is happening. It has a name and I know others who are also dyslexic.” Olivia’s relief was evident; she felt so much better. <i>A diagnosis of dyslexia puts all the pieces together so they are not floating, unattached fragments. They are coherently joined together in a pattern that makes sense and leads to a road map—an effective plan of action.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Reliable scientific and clinical information in support of the diagnosis is vital. It will make clear what the child is experiencing—which brain systems are involved—and what effective treatment will look like. The diagnosis also allows the child to know she is not alone, as was the case with Olivia—that she is a member of a community of boys and girls who are dyslexic. Right before a patient of mine, Evan, popped the question to his girlfriend, Emma, he looked her directly in the eye, cleared his throat, and said, “Before we go any further, there is something about me you should know.” “What’s that?” asked Emma. “I’m dyslexic,” Evan said. “Oh,” laughed his fiancée-to-be, “don’t worry about that. I’m dyslexic too.”</p>
			<p class="indent">A diagnosis also brings together the various adults who interact and make ongoing decisions impacting the child’s daily life and her future. Having the symptoms coalesce into a meaningful diagnosis that has a name and explanatory power also provides a common language that facilitates communication with specialists in disparate disciplines who have an impact on the life of a child who is dyslexic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Skye Lucas is a wonderfully happy and successful young woman now. However, when she was just starting school, she simply could not read. As Skye tells it,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>The thing that was really difficult for me was that I didn’t realize what I had. So I would always think I was dumb, and it was tough, because kids in the class would always read about five or more books each week and I couldn’t even get through the first chapter of any of them. I struggled a lot.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92" title="92"/>According to Skye’s mom, Geralyn, “She seemed very anxious and then she would call me from the nurse’s office and say she had a stomachache.” At one point Skye said, “My brain is not working. I don’t know what’s going on.” “And I think that when I saw Skye and how depressed she was,” says Geralyn, “and how she thought she was dumb, and she didn’t believe in herself, I just thought I was losing her at age six.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I went to talk to the principal. I thought it would help me,” says Skye. “And I asked him, ‘Am I dumb? Is this not the right place for me?’ ”</p>
			<p class="indent">With the powerful, indisputable scientific knowledge available today, no child should have to experience that terrifying and lonely feeling of isolation that comes with not knowing why you are suffering and why reading is so difficult for you. For many children, knowing you are not stupid—rather, like Skye, are quite smart—can be a game-changer.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DRILLING DOWN: WHY DYSLEXIA AND NOT A LEARNING DISABILITY</b></h2>
			<p>
				The terms <i>learning disability, dyslexia,</i> and <i>unexpected</i> have a strong relationship, but it is important to discuss their significant differences. But first let me offer a sobering reminder.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> For parents of a dyslexic child and for dyslexic young men and women, beware of such innocuous-sounding but essentially uninformative and unhelpful terms as <i>learning differences</i> and <i>learning disability.</i> A dyslexic individual learns little from this kind of label. Self-awareness is certainly not strengthened by these terms, which are vague and lack specificity.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">What are the specific symptoms of a learning disability? What is the difficulty, what is the origin of the difficulty, and where in the brain does it reside? What are the proven treatments and what happens over time? The answer to each of these questions for terms such as <i>learning differences</i> and <i>learning disability</i> is unknown. These terms lack all the benefits of empowerment, knowledge, and specific direction provided by a precise diagnosis of dyslexia. When something can’t be precisely defined, it often raises anxiety, whereas knowing the name and all the scientific knowledge that goes with a diagnosis of dyslexia is reassuring and empowering.</p>
			<p class="indent">Earlier you read about Dr. Pringle Morgan’s initial scientific report in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93" title="93"/>1896 of an unexpected difficulty in reading (developmental dyslexia), followed by many reports of similar cases of unexpected reading difficulties in children originating in Britain, Europe, and the United States. As I noted earlier, Scottish ophthalmologist James Hinshelwood reported many cases in which he emphasized the <i>unexpected</i> nature of the reading difficulty; it was due not to a generalized deficit in intelligence but to a “localized” problem affecting reading. Indeed, Dr. Hinshelwood pointed out that such children had strengths as well as a reading difficulty.</p>
			<p class="indent">By the early twentieth century, clinicians had elaborated descriptions, possible causes, and potential treatments for developmental dyslexia. Perhaps the most cogent description came from the American physician Samuel Torrey Orton. In his 1937 monograph, <i>Reading, Writing and Speech Problems in Children,</i> Dr. Orton noted a number of characteristics of dyslexia, many of which remain true today. These include the observation that though some dyslexic individuals may learn to read, their reading remains slow compared to that of their peers in age and intelligence, a phenomenon we have come to refer to as a lack of reading fluency. He further observed that while their reading often could appear appropriate for their age, it was below what was expected for their intelligence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Around this time, other astute clinicians were beginning to elaborate on what came to be known as the brain-injured child, which by 1962 had evolved into what American psychologist Sam Clements and American psychiatrist John Peters described as Minimal Brain Dysfunctions (MBD). The first finding mentioned was specific learning deficits, and the first symptoms noted were failure to read and poor spelling. In the same year American educators Samuel Kirk and Barbara Bateman first used the term <i>learning disability</i> (LD) and illustrated the evaluation of a learning disability with the steps in diagnosing a reading disability. Kirk and Bateman noted that the very first step in determining if the child has a learning disability is determining the child’s reading <i>capacity,</i> a measure reflecting IQ. Then actual reading achievement is determined, and the “discrepancy between the capacity for reading and actual achievement in reading is examined.” Prominent American psychologist Helmer Myklebust emphasized the hallmark of learning disability as a discrepancy between potential and actual success in learning resulting in significant underachievement.</p>
			<p class="indent">In an effort to clarify the relationship between learning disability and dyslexia, Bennett and I wrote on our Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity website: <span id="ftn-66"/>“Learning disabilities, as described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), refer, in part, to such symptoms as ‘imperfect ability…<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94" title="94"/>to think’ which not only do not at all apply to dyslexia but could even be harmful to those who are dyslexic. <i>Dyslexics have a reading impairment, not a thinking impairment.</i> This is one reason why it is important to differentiate dyslexia from the general and more heterogeneous ‘learning disabilities.’ ”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-67"/>In September 2014, when I testified before the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on the “Science of Dyslexia,” I again addressed the distinction between dyslexia and learning disabilities.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>Dyslexia is specific; learning disabilities are general.</i> Dyslexia differs markedly from all other learning disabilities. Dyslexia is very specific and scientifically validated: We know its prevalence, cognitive and neurobiological origins, symptoms, and effective, evidence-based interventions. <i>Learning disabilities</i> is a general term referring to a range of difficulties which have not yet been delineated or scientifically validated. Learning disabilities are comparable to what in medicine are referred to as “infectious” diseases [that is, learning disabilities are more like the general term i<i>nfection,</i> which can have many different causes along with many different symptoms and differing treatments depending on the specific infection], while dyslexia is akin to being diagnosed with a strep throat—a highly specific disorder in which the causative agent and evidence-based treatment are both known and validated.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>I concluded my testimony with a plea “to bring education together with current scientific knowledge,” followed by a list of specific recommendations, beginning with my number-one recommendation: “First and foremost, schools must not be allowed to ignore, fail to recognize, or deny the reality or diagnosis of dyslexia.” A diagnosis doesn’t make the child dyslexic; it clears the fog and reveals what is already present.</p>
			<p class="indent">As I said earlier, school personnel often refuse to acknowledge or diagnose dyslexia. Typically, this reflects lack of knowledge—actually, ignorance—about dyslexia. At the same time, it may well be the child’s parent who, for very different reasons, is in denial and avoids obtaining a firm diagnosis. Just as a school’s failure to provide a diagnosis may do harm, a parent’s fear can have a long-lasting negative impact. For all the moms and dads reading this, my message is, <i>Don’t be afraid.</i> Perhaps the most common source of fear and anxiety is the unknown, and that is far too often the case with dyslexia. My insightful friend Karen refers to dyslexia as “the disorder <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95" title="95"/>that can’t be named,” sarcastically but sympathetically referring to parents’ misplaced fears.</p>
			<p class="indent">It’s important to remember that if your child is dyslexic, it’s going to impact her whether it is diagnosed or not, causing havoc in her life. Not identifying a problem does not make it go away. Specifically, diagnosing dyslexia is the necessary first step to taming the disorder and successfully managing it. In my decades of experience working with scores of parents and children, I do not know of one parent or child who regretted obtaining an accurate diagnosis of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Please remember as well that the diagnosis reveals true intelligence, a morale booster. Let your child in on the news. Yes, your child may struggle to decipher written words, but at the same time she is also likely to be an out-of-the-box, creative thinker. She will be happy to hear that.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>UNLOCKING THE MYSTERY OF DYSLEXIA: WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT IMPACTS YOU</b></h2>
			<p>
				A major reason a diagnosis of dyslexia is able to pull together and make sense of what may at first blush appear to be a random array of symptoms is that science has uncovered the origin of the difficulty. As I said, the basic deficit in dyslexia is a problem getting to the individual sounds of spoken words. This scientific knowledge allows the clinician, educator, and especially concerned parents to recognize the symptoms of dyslexia—to know in a tangible way the <i>why, what,</i> and <i>how</i> of dyslexia. This allows a reliable diagnosis at the earliest possible moment. Recognition and diagnosis of dyslexia is clearly the essential first step in the development of an effective plan to support and treat the difficulty and to unburden both the child and his parents, as well as the teacher involved, from what is often a confusing and frustrating situation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the mystery of the <i>why</i> is solved, confusion and apprehension are replaced by logic and confidence. Knowing the source, the <i>what,</i> the origins of what your child is experiencing is empowering. Once you know, you are in charge of determining what is best for your child. You are an active player, not merely a passive observer. A parent is the child’s number-one champion, and once a diagnosis is made you have the critical information required to go forward with determination. As demonstrated in Figure 28, once you know the diagnosis is dyslexia, you also know the origin of the difficulties and how to deal with them to best help your child. Working from a diagnostic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96" title="96"/>model makes so much sense, clarifying just what dyslexia is and why and what characteristics are associated with the condition.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">Knowledge of the underlying deficit in dyslexia translates into a very useful clinical tool that brings reason and understanding to the diagnosis, an important step in the development of targeted, focused, and, most critically, successful school, home, and personal intervention plans. Once you understand that the diagnosis is dyslexia, you know that you are dealing with a problem that affects multiple areas, including speaking, spelling, writing, and learning a second language in addition to reading.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97" title="97"/>The importance of this awareness was brought home to me when I heard from Harold, whose son, Eli, was never diagnosed but was placed in a reading program in second grade that produced some modest results. At the time Harold was pleased that his son didn’t have to go through an assessment process. Moreover, Eli’s teacher seemed to be pleased with Eli’s performance. However, today Harold very much regrets the lack of a diagnosis for his son and not having had the benefit of the knowledge that goes with the diagnosis. Now fourteen years old and in ninth grade, Eli “can’t spell very well, hates writing, and is already frustrated in trying to learn a foreign language in school. How much frustration we would have been spared had Eli been diagnosed as dyslexic when he was in second grade and received the evidence-based interventions he required and the knowledge of who he is that goes with the diagnosis.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Harold’s experience carries an important message for all parents: Don’t settle for some limited support for your child. A true diagnosis is essential.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DYSLEXIA IS A PARADOX: SLOW READING, FAST THINKING</b></h2>
			<p>One of the most essential features to know about dyslexia is its paradoxical nature. Slow reading does not imply slow thinking. People often improperly confuse the two, a false notion that may limit the aspirations and options of a dyslexic child. Such a misconception harms adults, too. For instance, I have heard people say, “Oh, I would never want a dyslexic doctor to care for me when I am taken in to the emergency room.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Dr. Karen Santucci, professor of pediatrics and director of the very busy, fast-paced, and world-class emergency department at Yale Children’s Hospital—and dyslexic—refutes that:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>It’s not like you have to sit down with a textbook; rather, hearing things, seeing things, experiencing things, taking care of patients, listening to patients, identifying their signs and symptoms, putting the pieces of information together, I can assimilate that rapidly and without a moment’s hesitation. I may not be able to read very quickly, but I can process the information quickly.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>(If your doctor has to sit and read about your symptoms in a book when you are taken to the ER in the midst of a heart attack, blue and gasping for air, you are in deep trouble!)</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98" title="98"/>Dyslexia is a true paradox, with weaknesses in concrete observable tasks like reading and spelling, which are noticed in the classroom and result in the student’s being criticized. That same dyslexic student, however, also has significant strengths in big-picture thinking and reasoning—highly advantageous attributes that are not as easily noticed and are often overlooked. Should his or her life be defined by: high thinking ability and excellent reasoning or slow reading and poor spelling?</p>
			<p class="indent">In an attempt to correct the prevalent misunderstanding of dyslexia, I have paired the symptoms of dyslexia to illustrate its paradoxical nature. Our conceptualization of dyslexia brings to life our Sea of Strengths model, discussed earlier, and how it expresses itself. I have placed this synthesis of dyslexia on a four-by-six yellow card titled, “ARE YOU A SLOW READER, AN OUT-OF-THE-BOX THINKER? COULD YOU BE DYSLEXIC?” I take this card with me whenever I travel and often share it with the person next to me on a plane or train. I continue to be amazed at the reactions I get: “Oh, I never knew that this is what dyslexia is,” or, “Are you sure? Isn’t dyslexia about reversing letters?” (No, it is not.) Or, “I can’t believe it. I always thought my son might be dyslexic, yet this describes <i>me</i> to a T. I want to say, <i>How did you know? This is me. I am dyslexic. I never knew it.</i> This explains so much.”</p>
			<p class="indent">These pairings, a <i>weakness</i> and along with it a strength, capture the paradox of dyslexia: slow reading and creativity, two sides of the same coin.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p class="small sans"><b>YOU MAY BE DYSLEXIC IF YOU…</b></p>

			<p class="indent">From a more personal perspective, here is how two of the brightest, most insightful dyslexic minds have described this paradox:</p>

			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100" title="100"/>That it is unexpected for a person who is highly intelligent to read at a much lower level defines a major aspect of dyslexia. It answers the question, can a very bright, even gifted child be dyslexic? Far too often parents are told, “Your son is too smart to be dyslexic,” or “Her reading score is too high for her to be dyslexic.” Without question, a highly intelligent person can be dyslexic.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY DEFINITION OF DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>It has taken more than 120 years since dyslexia was first described, but we finally have a definition that is universal and incorporates all of our up-to-date knowledge: the science, the paradox, the educational implications, and the importance of a diagnosis for school and for personal life satisfaction. Given the importance of the definition of dyslexia to its diagnosis, a critical step has been its codification into federal law.</p>
			<p class="indent">In this area, Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy’s dedication and perseverance have been vitally important. The devoted father of a child who is dyslexic, Cassidy understands the impact of dyslexia along with the often overwhelming anxiety and worries of parents who are waiting for their child’s school to provide their child with the benefits of a specific diagnosis. He is a passionate, unrelenting advocate for children who are dyslexic. Recently he spearheaded the inclusion of the scientific definition of dyslexia into the First Step Act, which was passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress and when signed into law by President Trump on December 21, 2018, became Public Law 115-391. The law reads: “The term ‘dyslexia’ means an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader, most commonly caused by a difficulty in the phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell.”</p>
			<p class="indent">This definition applies to all those boys and girls, men and women affected throughout the world. More and more countries are recognizing their citizens who are dyslexic. I have been both surprised and gratified that the first edition of <i>Overcoming Dyslexia</i> has now been translated not only into the usual alphabetic languages, such as Portuguese, Dutch, Croatian, and Polish, but also, as I noted earlier, into Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin; see Figure 31), and Korean.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>HOW DYSLEXIA IMPACTS BRIGHT CHILDREN</b></h2>
			<p>
				Especially for bright children and adults who struggle to read and for whom reading is a slow, laborious process, the concept of dyslexia as an unexpected difficulty has great relevance. These bright, often gifted individuals, through extremely hard work, much practice, and resilience, often learn how to read relatively accurately but almost never automatically. Although they are able to read or make good guesses at what a word is, reading remains a slow and tiring process. That said, I have come across quite a number of dyslexic men and women who are relatively fluent readers of materials in their area of expertise, such as those in finance who are daily readers of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> or those in a particular area of medicine who regularly read articles in their specialty, including cardiology, psychiatry, and anesthesiology. The individual’s focused interest in a topic draws her to reading and frequently rereading materials, which leads to a relative degree of fluency in that specific area.</p>
			<p class="indent">What is a student to do when she knows how difficult reading is for her, how much slower she reads than her peers, and how often she tries to rush in her reading only to find that she has to reread the material? What is she to do when the disparity (often referred to as a discrepancy) between her intelligence and reading is disregarded by the school or testing agency? Now, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102" title="102"/>finally, powerful new evidence validates the disparity between intelligence and reading as a hallmark of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">As noted earlier, I am the principal investigator of the Connecticut Longitudinal Study, which has followed a large random sample of schoolchildren from kindergarten entry through to adulthood. While in school, each child was administered an individual IQ test, the Wechsler scales, in alternate years, and a Woodcock-Johnson reading test yearly. I was eager to examine the relationship between reading and intelligence in this group of students.</p>
			<p class="indent">In our analyses, focusing on <i>typical</i> readers, we found that reading and intelligence are dynamically linked, meaning that not only do IQ and reading travel together over time, they influence each other as well. A child’s IQ one year will influence his reading score the following year, while his reading score one year will influence his IQ in a subsequent year. Not surprisingly, and conforming to what most people would anticipate, if a typical person is very bright, that individual will most probably be a very good reader, and if someone is a very good reader, he will most likely also be quite intelligent.</p>
			<p class="indent">In planning and carrying out experiments, a scientist proposes a theory (technically, a hypothesis), plans a series of studies to test this hypothesis, and analyzes the resulting data. In examining the data from the Connecticut study, we were thrilled by what these same analyses showed when they were applied to <i>dyslexic</i> readers. These data (see Figure 32) indicate that <i>in the case of dyslexia</i> (right panel), <i>IQ and reading are not linked at all.</i> The data show that dyslexics can have a very high IQ but still struggle to read; that is, they can think quickly and read slowly. To many of us, this should be self-evident, but as a researcher, I find empirical findings that validate logical but often questioned associations are necessary, and in this case rewarding. <span id="ftn-68"/>These data provide the long-sought-after empirical validation of the <i>unexpected</i> nature of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">From a practical perspective, these findings are of great value to bright dyslexic students who require interventions and/or accommodations. They provide the critical evidence supporting the validity of a disparity (discrepancy) between intelligence and reading achievement scores as a core component of the definition of dyslexia. Figure 32, along with the definition of dyslexia in the recent First Step Act, will come in handy if you request intervention or accommodations and you are told your child is too bright.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is not unusual for struggling dyslexic readers to come to doubt, or at least to question, their own intelligence. Seeing the information in Figure 32 should have a powerful and positive effect on them, reaffirming their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_103" title="103"/>intelligence and going a long way to begin to repair any bruises to their self-concept. Every evaluator should take the time to visibly demonstrate to every tested child (I like to do this on a bell-shaped curve) where his or her reading lies and then where on this curve his or her intelligence score lies. When this information comes from an objective authority figure rather than the student’s parents, it makes a powerful impact.</p>

			<p class="indent">I can recall a very sweet, somewhat shy young man named Rob, who was dyslexic and about to enter college. He expressed great concern about his ability to succeed in what seemed like a very demanding new setting. He expressed feelings of inadequacy, of not being smart enough to succeed, yet he tested at the very superior range of intelligence, higher than ninety out of 100 peers who took the test. I placed in front of him a classic bell-shaped curve drawn on a piece of white paper, representing the distribution of IQ values in the general population. I pointed out to Rob that, as in Figure 33, the raised midpoint indicates the average IQ score; the left extreme end represents the very lowest IQ scores and the right extreme end the very highest IQ scores. I then asked him to place an <i>X</i> where he thought his IQ fell on the curve. As expected, Rob’s line was to the left of the midpoint, slightly below average. “Well,” I said to him, “would you like me to take the pencil and make a mark where your IQ really tested?” He mumbled a somewhat reluctant “Yeah.”</p>

			<p class="indent">When I put my pen down close to the extreme right side of the curve, indicating his exceptionally high score, he scowled as he uttered, “You’re kidding me, right?” Rob was exceptionally bright. In previous assessments, no one had actually sat down with him and explained his performance and how very intelligent he was. As his dad said, “This changed Rob’s life, a real turnaround for him. No one had ever told him he was really smart.” He had based his self-evaluation on the reading struggles he had experienced over the years, on the criticism he had gotten from many of his teachers, and on his belief that reading and intelligence were linked.</p>
			<p class="indent">The published empirical demonstration of a disparity between intelligence and reading has significant implications for the diagnosis of dyslexia.</p>

The results of the student’s performance by this measurement are necessary information, especially for a very bright student.</p>

Although different reasons are cited for this omission, I believe it usually reflects financial constraints. Such an omission is a disservice to the child and improper for the school that has the responsibility for his education.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105" title="105"/>Simply relying on reading tests alone is in essence placing a ceiling on a child’s reading. Educators, especially those who are charged with overseeing a child’s education in the fullest sense of the term—providing academic, social, and moral instruction—must not prevent their students from knowing fully and from receiving an accurate and helpful diagnosis that is linked to effective instruction.</p>

				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> It is important for you to be aware of several key pieces of information in considering the findings of your child’s (or your own) IQ test. In the Appendix I focus on the most widely used measures of intelligence.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Awareness that you are dyslexic and that it is an unexpected difficulty can be a happy surprise at any age or stage of life. Let me introduce you to Pat, a highly patriotic and philanthropic citizen who because of her contributions reflecting both of these characteristics had been nominated for a high position serving our government. I met Pat a few years back and was pleased to speak to her when she called. As is often the case when people call me, I thought she was calling to ask me about one of her children or perhaps a grandchild. No, Pat was calling to ask me about herself. She told me she was unsure if she would or should accept this honor, because, she said, “I don’t read very well. Most people, aside from my inner family, don’t know this, and I don’t want to embarrass our country. I worry that my poor reading will be problematic, especially if I have to read a speech in public. I would not be up to it.” Could she come to New Haven and be evaluated for dyslexia? she asked. I said, <i>Of course.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">After she was evaluated, I told Pat she was, indeed, dyslexic—and incredibly smart. “How do you know?” she asked me. “Did you give me one of those dumbed-down tests for dyslexics?” “You were given the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (WAIS), the gold standard IQ test,” I told her. “The WAIS has no reading on it, it’s all about thinking and not reading.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“But we give tests to our employees, you know,” Pat interjected, “to help see which have the ability to move forward, to contribute to the company. These tests have lots of reading.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes, Pat,” I said. “The irony is that in your own company you are relying on tests that must be read, and in the process are missing perhaps the brightest men and women, who may not be great readers but are highly creative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106" title="106"/>thinkers and problem-solvers. Ironically, your company would be missing a person like you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Pat breathed a sigh of relief. She knew for certain for the first time that she was not fooling everyone. She was a truly smart woman, capable of making complex decisions, not in spite of her being dyslexic but because of it. Pat accepted and served with honor in the position she was offered. Bennett and I were invited to her swearing-in ceremony in Washington, DC. When it came my turn on the receiving line to shake her hand, she instead reached out and brought me close to her with a heartfelt hug. There were tears streaming down both our faces. “Thank you,” she whispered, “for introducing me to who I am and for giving me the confidence and courage to accept this position.” Later, at the reception, several people came up to Bennett and me, asking, “You received such a warm hug, one that seemed so very special. Are you family whom we have never met?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No,” I responded, “just very good friends.”</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>SPECIAL BUT NOT RARE SITUATIONS INFLUENCING THE DIAGNOSIS OF DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>A woman once said to me, “My grandson is very bright. He reads in what we have been told is the average range. Does this mean he cannot be dyslexic?” First it needs to be said that the so-called average range covers a wide territory. For example, a child might score as low as the ninth percentile (lower than 91 percent of the test-takers of the same age; if one hundred students took the test, ninety-one would have scored higher) and yet still be considered by some testing agencies and schools as performing in the average (albeit low average) range. Often when a student’s reading is in that range and he scores well in reading comprehension, he is not properly diagnosed as dyslexic, which prevents much-needed effective intervention and accommodations. Reading in the average range should not be used to deny a diagnosis of dyslexia or to withhold needed services.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">

			</div>
			<p class="indent">There is also a surprising relationship between dyslexia and reading comprehension. Interestingly, when reading connected text (sentences, paragraphs, chapters), bright dyslexics, by using their high level of reasoning ability, often excellent vocabulary, and strong general knowledge, are frequently able to glean the gist or meaning of the material read, even though they may misread words here and there. <span id="ftn-69"/>So it should come as no surprise that in a paper published several years ago, we reported that <i>at young adulthood there was no significant difference in reading comprehension scores in groups of students who were dyslexic compared to those who were typical readers.</i> The study found that while these dyslexic young men and women continued to struggle with reading individual words either accurately or rapidly, they were able to <i>comprehend</i> connected text better than they were able to read single words. The finding that a person comprehends what she reads does not negate the fact that she may be dyslexic and as a result has to exert a great amount of effort to read. Importantly, the reading comprehension tests were not timed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-70"/>I can think of no better example of a slow reader who is an out-of-the-box creative thinker than the brilliant and dyslexic filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who in an interview shared that his dyslexia still affects him. For example, it may take him longer than others to read a script, but his comprehension is superior to that of most others, including those who may have whizzed through the script.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">“I am not sure how much slower I am in reading than the normal person,” says David Boies. “I’m noticeably slower—maybe half as fast. I absorb a lot by going slowly. And so when I’m reading for comprehension, even though I may read at a pace that’s one-half or one-third the pace that other people may be reading at, at the end of that period I will have learned a lot—and absorbed a lot more than many of them [the fast readers] will.”</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> There are myths about dyslexia that need to be shattered. Among them:</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>Dyslexia is a medical, not an educational, diagnosis.</i> While dyslexia is neurobiologically based, it brings with it significant educational implications. Dyslexia originates from the brain, as does every other learning ability or disability. Fortunately, informed educators and parents know what symptoms to look for, what questions to ask, and what assessment measures to administer or to request.</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>Only neuropsychologists can administer a test of intelligence (an IQ test), such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fifth edition (WISC-V).</i> According to Pearson, the company that developed and distributes the WISC-V, qualified individuals must have a “doctorate degree in psychology, education, or closely related field…or licensure or certification to practice in this state in a field related to the purchase…or certification by, or full active membership in, a professional organization that requires training and experience in the relevant area of assessment.”</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>Only a neuropsychologist can make a diagnosis of dyslexia.</i> The diagnosis of dyslexia can be made by a professional with a deep <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109" title="109"/>understanding of dyslexia, including an educator, a school psychologist, a physician, and a speech and language therapist. Dyslexia is a clinical diagnosis based on the individual’s history, observation of him speaking and reading aloud, and test scores, as I said earlier.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">It is important to know that you do not need to be the person who administers each test in order to be the one to make a diagnosis of dyslexia. In a similar way, if I or anyone else knowledgeable about dyslexia sees a child who may be dyslexic, I will take a history, listen to him speaking and reading aloud, and order a test of intelligence along with other relevant measures of reading. The same approach can be and is taken by the professionals I noted above.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p>At this point you have a broad overview of the essentials of dyslexia and know that an extremely intelligent child can also be dyslexic. You understand the rationale for and critical importance of obtaining a diagnosis and are knowledgeable about the key elements of a diagnosis of dyslexia. You are also fully equipped not to be fooled by claims often made about dyslexia by some schools in denying a diagnosis to deserving students.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the discussion that follows you will find specific, detailed information that offers a closer, more practical, and more personal guide to the diagnosis of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a dyslexic child enters school, there are two potential paths he can take, one leading to a life of satisfaction and self-fulfillment, the other leading to a dispirited feeling of “what might have been,” of lost potential and missed opportunities. These possibilities are shown in Figure 34, illustrating the different pathways and choices before a young child and their consequences. For example, to the left is a child who is dyslexic but does not receive a diagnosis, and as a result does not receive evidence-based interventions (EBI) or accommodations. This failure to diagnose dyslexia often leads to school failure, unrealized potential, and low self-esteem—a tremendous loss to the child, to his family, and to society. In contrast, the child who receives a diagnosis of dyslexia is on the pathway to receiving EBI and accommodations leading to academic success, self-knowledge, empowerment, and fulfillment. The child has a far better chance of realizing his potential and contributing to society.</p>
