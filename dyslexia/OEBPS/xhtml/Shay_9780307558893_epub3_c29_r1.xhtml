			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>HELPING ADULTS BECOME BETTER READERS</b></h1>
			<p>There are ample opportunities to improve the reading abilities of adults who are dyslexic, and a wide range of career possibilities are open to them. To give you an inkling of what is possible, I am going to introduce you to a man who is very dyslexic and is now in the midst of a career neither you nor I would think a dyslexic adult could be successful in, much less one in which he could advance to the very top.</p>
			<p class="indent">Meet Brian Bannon, a man in his forties who had difficulty catching on to reading as early as kindergarten, which he repeated. His concerned mom had him tested in first grade and he was placed in special education, where he remained throughout his schooling. The family did not have great means; his father worked in water well drilling and his mom in a flower shop. Brian described his mother as being really engaged, his true champion. She strongly encouraged his involvement in theater, and, as Brian told me, helped build his self-confidence. And yet,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>no matter what she did, not being able to learn like other kids and as quickly was something I carried with me for such a long time—just the feeling of being stupid, even when you have all the advantages of an engaged parent and a lot of caring teachers.</p>
				<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_402" title="402"/>I was probably the only kid in special ed who had a diagnosed learning disability. Most of the kids basically had behavior problems. And what’s really sad about that is that I’m the only person in that group of kids who graduated from high school.</p>
				<p class="indent">I was the first person in my family to go to college, and only because I was a swimmer; I got scholarship offers. That was so unexpected for me. I never saw myself as being good at school, so I was going to go directly into a trade. Never in a million years would I have imagined…</p>
				<p class="indent">Even though I had a lot of help, I never read at grade level—but I had a desire to learn. I remember I would sit in our little neighborhood library and I would imagine all of the knowledge in those books. But I never really thought it would be possible to be able to absorb all that knowledge and information I really wanted.</p>
				<p class="indent">In eighth grade there was a teacher who was really trying to help me. He said for all history tests we could do open-note tests. I would study for hours and hours, make notes, bring them into class—and still fail the tests. I even tried to game the system—I would transcribe all three chapters and literally come into the test with all three chapters stacked up, and still fail the test. I just couldn’t read my notes fast enough to answer the questions in time. And yet all my work taking notes was a real turning point for me. I learned that I had a level of discipline and a level of work ethic that was far beyond those of my peers.</p>
				<p class="indent">Once I got into college I started to realize that all those years bumping up against the wall—trying one thing, trying another—really instilled a mindset and habits and discipline that defined my ability to chart out a career and be successful. I graduated at the top of my class in college.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">From 2012 to May 2019, Brian served as commissioner of the Chicago Public Library, with eighty member libraries and one of the best public library systems nationally and internationally. This was Brian’s title until May 9, 2019, when the New York Public Library named him as the inaugural Merryl and James Tisch Director of the library system. The New York Public Library, the largest public library system in the United States other than the Library of Congress, has ninety-two locations and 53 million items. Brian Bannon deservedly reached this pinnacle in the public library world by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_403" title="403"/>employing his sea of strengths, recognizing the great strengths surrounding his weaknesses and putting them into play. In Brian’s own words:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Once you are able to get over that hump, what you learn is that on the other side the high-ordered thinking is there, the discipline is there, and also the ability to work harder than everybody else who’s there. All of a sudden things open up.</p>
				<p class="indent">I barely imagined graduating from high school, much less college. It was only the factors of a supportive parent, caring teachers, and a university saying, <i>We’ll pay for your college if you come and swim for us</i> that even got me through the door.</p>
				<p class="indent">It was a teacher, my wonderful college history professor, who spurred my interest in library science. We were studying social justice and social justice movements and I got really interested in these questions around how people acquire knowledge and information to create action in the world. It was information as a tool for social change, information and knowledge as a tool for advocacy and self-empowerment. Then she said, “Brian, have you ever thought about going on to graduate school and doing work in library science?”</p>
				<p class="indent">I laughed at her. Library science? She responded, “You know, people have a narrow idea of what libraries are like today, and you should look into it.” I was really interested in this set of questions—from my own experience of feeling shut out from the world of knowledge and information because of the challenges I had reading. I started reading and learning more about what libraries are really there to do. It opened me up to an intellectual idea about information as power. Looking back to my own experience as a dyslexic person, if you can’t acquire knowledge and information that is all around us, you’re really at a huge disadvantage in life and in the world. So that’s what got me interested intellectually in libraries.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Brian took over the Chicago Public Library at age thirty-seven, after gaining experience at a series of libraries in Seattle and San Francisco, where his thoughts about the role of libraries in modern society coalesced. He discussed these with then Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had reached out to him about a potential leadership position in Chicago. You can just <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_404" title="404"/>imagine the excitement rising as these two civic-minded men discussed what the mayor was trying to achieve: improve learning outcomes in this city, support neighborhood growth, strengthen economic development, and encourage workforce development. The two shared a sharp focus on the library as the vehicle to support community-based learning and unlock the creativity of neighborhoods as part of a strategy to make Chicago competitive in the information economy.</p>
			<p class="indent">I was thrilled listening to this extraordinary individual fully engaging his creative thinking and his experiences as a dyslexic to help unlock the potential of all students, particularly those who are dyslexic. Brian argues that, yes, we must help support dyslexic students because our hearts tell us it is the right thing to do. At the same time, he emphasizes that it is also the smart thing to do.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>If you think about a city like Chicago, if 20 percent of Chicago kids are dyslexic, and we know that the brain has the potential of operating at a really high level, unlocking innovation, invention, it’s those ideas and innovations that we’re keeping our society from if we don’t figure out how to make those connections. If we’re not helping unlock the creativity and ingenuity and the innovation that exists in the minds of people in our society, we’re going to miss out big.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Brian Bannon represents an inspiring example of how often and unexpectedly dyslexic men and women think deeply and at a level above most of us. All around us there are other Brian Bannons, with great potential they are unaware of, people who wish to advance in their work and in their reading ability. There is no deadline or age limit for when a person can learn to read or become a better reader. Research attests to the plasticity of the human brain and its ability to reshape itself in mature adults, as it does in children. There are many dyslexic adults who are out of school and working, or in retirement, who simply want to learn to read or have more focused goals related to their work, or to pursue a high school equivalency diploma. Such adults face a serious challenge, but one that they can meet successfully.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-161"/>Lack of literacy is a major national concern. Thirty million adults (14 percent) in this country score <i>below</i> basic reading level in prose literacy skills—skills needed to comprehend and use connected texts—even though 45 percent graduated from high school. These adults are extremely inefficient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_405" title="405"/>readers, reading about sixty correct words per minute, <i>a rate expected of first- to second-graders.</i> Interestingly, surveys report that many limited readers perceive themselves as reading well. This may explain in some part why only a small percentage of adults (less than 10 percent) who have limited reading ability are enrolled in adult literacy programs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any adult, no matter his age, who cannot read or who struggles to read should participate in a literacy program. It will turn his life around. Literacy skills are critical in providing options for training, jobs, and careers. In trade schools, for example, students are expected to read course manuals written at the tenth-grade level or higher. In fact, in the coming years the vast majority of new jobs will require a twelfth-grade reading level. The ability to read impacts the quality of everyday life. Printed materials we read every day require a surprisingly high level of reading; a Friendly’s menu, instructions on an ATM, and the Internal Revenue Service EZ form are all written at a tenth-grade level. <span id="ftn-162"/>At least a ninth-grade reading ability is needed to fill out employment applications, so low literacy influences trying to find a job regardless of the person’s capability to do the job. To allow someone to enter adulthood and remain a very limited reader is to sentence him to second-class citizenry.</p>
			<p class="indent">You or your spouse, your parents, grown children, or friends don’t have to be stuck: You can rise above these difficulties. On a national level, almost 75 percent of the children of parents who have low literacy also are poor readers. In our Connecticut Longitudinal Study, in which children from age five are followed well into adulthood, we found that as adults, almost half of the dyslexic men and women (compared to approximately 20 percent of nondyslexics) had no education past high school, and that those who were dyslexic had triple the unemployment rate of nondyslexics.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-163"/>In a recent paper Bennett, I, and our colleagues Daniel Herrera-Araujo, John Holahan, and James Hammitt used a strategy known as willingness to pay (WTP) to examine how dyslexic and nondyslexic adults (about thirty-three years old at the time of the study) valued improvements in cognitive skills. Specifically, we asked the now adult Connecticut Longitudinal Study participants questions to elicit their willingness to pay for hypothetical treatments that would raise five cognitive skills—reading speed, ability to read aloud, memory, ability to pronounce names and places correctly, and ability to retrieve facts and information rapidly—to “very good.” These skills were to be improved by participating in a hypothetical intervention that required engaging in two one-hour training sessions each week for two <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_406" title="406"/>months. The cost was to be paid as a one-time fee and would not be covered by insurance. For each of the hypothetical treatments the participants were first asked if they would participate in the intervention if the cost was $1,000. Those who responded yes were then asked if they would participate if the cost were $2,000; those who responded no to the first offer were asked if they would participate if the cost were $500.</p>
			<p class="indent">We found that the rates of WTP were similar in four out of the five cognitive skill areas for both dyslexic and nondyslexic readers. However, dyslexic individuals were willing to pay significantly more than nondyslexics to improve their skill in <i>reading aloud.</i> This result provides scientific validation for the frequent stories I hear from dyslexics of all ages about how difficult it was and continues to be to read aloud. Clearly dyslexic adults continue to feel burdened by the effects of their dyslexia even into their fourth decade.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Adults who are poor readers and for whom English is their first language are for the most part dyslexic.</i> Some were never diagnosed as dyslexic and received inadequate or no specialized reading help. Many of these dropped out of school, while some went on to graduate, although with extremely limited reading ability. Still others were identified as having a reading problem but received limited help. They learned to decode, perhaps, but did not receive the supervised reading practice necessary for fluency, so their reading skills are tenuous, and they do not read for pleasure or information. Some of these students dropped out of school and are now aiming for a GED diploma. There is an urgent need to recognize that these reading difficulties are most likely due to dyslexia and that the necessary systems to screen, identify, and effectively intervene were not in place to provide the needed help. As a consequence, many adult men and women who are bright and had the potential to benefit from evidence-based instruction were overlooked by society, including the educational system, and are now suffering the consequences. Those children who are left behind often follow a pathway filled with the consequences of low-level literacy and school failure and eventually drop out.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is now possible for an adult to accurately, efficiently, and confidentially find out whether he or she is at-risk for dyslexia using the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™, Adolescent-Adult Form. This brief, ten-question, evidence-based screener is completed by self-report to immediately determine if he or she is at-risk for dyslexia. The questions are read aloud (by a computer or by a tester) to the adult being screened, who answers “Never,” “Sometimes,” or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_407" title="407"/>“Always” to each question. Once all the questions are answered, the person receives immediate feedback on whether he or she is “at-risk for dyslexia” or “not at-risk for dyslexia.” Information on the screener can be obtained at <a href="http://www.PearsonClinical.com/Shaywitz">www.PearsonClinical.com/Shaywitz</a>.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>POSITIVE STEPS TO BETTER READING</b></h2>
			<p>A dyslexic adult can take positive steps to improve his reading and his life. It is well within your grasp if you have a strong desire to learn to read or to be a better reader. Several programs offer at least one reading year’s worth of improvement for each six months of instruction, depending on the intensity of instruction and the severity of the reading problem. While addressing the problem early is ideal, it is never too late to learn to read.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>GETTING STARTED: PICKING THE BEST PATHWAY</b></h3>
			<p>There are two complementary pathways you can pursue:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Look into the availability of an <i>adult basic education program</i> in your vicinity. Such programs typically help to prepare those who do not have a high school diploma for a GED exam or function as a bridge to programs and courses given at a community college.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>If your reading level is below what is necessary to benefit from the adult education program’s curriculum, you should locate a more basic program, referred to as an <i>adult literacy program.</i> These generally aim to teach students who require more intense and sustained instruction in reading. Following graduation from such a program, many students go on to attend adult education programs and to obtain their GED.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-164"/>There are two national, online, Zip Code–based directories of adult literacy programs: the National Literacy Directory, <a href="http://www.nld.org/">http://www.nld.org/</a>, which also has a toll-free number, and America’s Literacy Directory, <a href="https://www.literacydirectory.org/">https://www.literacydirectory.org/</a>. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education has also launched a very popular mobile Web portal for adult learners to connect with online learning sites, <a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/">https://lincs.ed.gov/</a>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_408" title="408"/>You can also visit your local public library and ask for a state directory (some libraries also serve as sites for literacy programs). Often students needing adult literacy instruction are referred by community or social agencies or church groups.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>PLACEMENT LEVEL</b></h3>
			<p>
				Once you have selected a program, the next step is to determine your placement level within that program. As is the case for children with dyslexia, there has been a sea change in the approach to adults with reading problems. Rather than a global test of reading, more up-to-date literacy programs give adults a placement test to determine their <i>exact</i> reading level and to detect specific gaps in their reading development. While children who are poor readers have not learned the foundational skills, adults, in contrast, may have acquired a smattering of some skills while they totally lack others. So placement testing is especially important for older dyslexic readers, since each is invariably starting from a different point. Keep in mind that the goal is to match the instruction as closely as possible with the adult’s needs. Frustration at a slower-than-wished-for pace or being engulfed by low self-esteem and worries about the future often cause a student to drop out of the program. Teachers (and adult students themselves) tend to overestimate an adult’s reading ability and are often surprised to see the results of the testing. The Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) is frequently used for assessing placement. Other assessments are available as well; for the names of these, you can consult the Federal Register, which lists approved tests: <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/21/2018-20590/tests-determined-to-be-suitable-for-use-in-the-national-reporting-system-for-adult-education">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/21/2018-20590/tests-determined-to-be-suitable-for-use-in-the-national-reporting-system-for-adult-education</a>. Ideally, the reading instruction is evidence-based, systematic, and delivered in small-group settings.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>ADULT ED PROGRAMS</b></h3>
			<p>Adults in particular do well with group instruction (with a well-trained teacher), and adult ed programs typically have teacher:pupil ratios of 1:16. It’s engaging, highly motivating, socializing, and effective. Adults benefit from learning from one another. Optimally this instruction occurs as often as four times a week, for one and a half to two hours each session. Some successful programs meet twice weekly but for longer periods, such as three hours. Consistent attendance is critical, since it is one of the few factors associated with better progress.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_409" title="409"/><b>ADULT LITERACY PROGRAMS</b></h3>
			<p>
				At times prospective students apply to adult ed programs but on evaluation are found to score below the level required to benefit from the program and are referred instead to an adult literacy program. Here the teacher:pupil ratio is much lower, typically 1:4, while for those needing basic literacy it may be as low as 1:1. Students like the more nurturing type of environment, one that doesn’t look or feel like a classroom, which often evokes unpleasant memories. Many attending these programs are unemployed, on public assistance, or at low income levels. Programs are considered completed when the student can read at an eighth-grade level. Those who complete the program tend to be older, and to compensate for their reading difficulty they seek to obtain information from magazines, the Internet, television, radio, and family and friends. <span id="ftn-165"/>Studies have found three kinds of obstacles preventing completion of adult literacy programs: situational (such as lack of child care), institutional (such as scheduled class times), and dispositional (such as self-esteem issues).</p>
			<p class="indent">For adults, issues of intensity and duration of instruction are particularly sensitive. Adults work during the day or may have young children—many students in adult reading programs are between sixteen and thirty—and it is often difficult for them to come to class more than twice a week. Long intervals between classes and lack of practice reading at home represent real barriers to progress. Adult students can expect to increase their reading one grade level for every hundred or so hours of instruction. Clearly, the more hours per week, the faster the improvement. So maximizing the amount of instructional time in class and particularly of practice at home is incredibly important.</p>
			<p class="indent">The time it will take to complete the program depends on the level at which the student began and how often she attended class. If a student starts at a basic reading level and comes to class twice weekly, it will generally require three to four years; if the student can attend only once a week, she will not be ready for completion for five to six years. Typically students come once a week for a two-hour session.</p>
			<p class="indent">I am often asked by potential students what the characteristics of a successful adult literacy program are. In one of the most successful programs I know, students attend a two-hour session four evenings a week. Intensity is stressed, and students may not miss more than thirteen days annually (in addition to a four-week vacation). Progress is often remarkable, some adults achieving a twelfth-grade or higher level of reading proficiency. While highly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_410" title="410"/>successful, the intensity and frequency of the sessions are unusual, for two important reasons. First, adult literacy programs are vastly underfunded; for the most part, they are led by trained volunteer instructors, of which there are far too few in number. Second, the population of struggling readers does not often have the luxury of attending classes frequently, for the reasons I’ve suggested.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>READING PROGRAMS USED FOR INTERVENTION</b></h3>
			<p>
				Reviewing the What Works Clearinghouse reports, I was unable to find reviews of reading programs designed specifically for struggling adult readers. However, effective programs focused on a broader age range have been reviewed by the WWC. From this group, for teaching adults I recommend the Wilson Reading System. In addition, adults wanting to practice their reading skills will find helpful <i>Lexia Reading SOS (Lexia Strategies for Older Students),</i> a computerized reading program. Lexia provides practice in a wide range of reading skills, including making letter-sound linkages, applying strategies for multisyllabic word analysis, and learning the meanings of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Lexia is intended as a supplement, not as a total reading program.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p>It is very common for students to have work-related concerns. Carmine, a talented forty-three-year-old appliance repairman, had to improve his reading skills when his company began using new computer technology. Today, repair work is often based less on mechanical aptitude than on the ability to read. Most new washers and dryers are manufactured with computer chips that provide detailed printouts of an appliance’s inner workings. As a result, all diagnostic work is based on the ability of the repairman to read and interpret schematics and other written information provided by the computer.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although a high school graduate, Carmine was barely able to read. With the support of his company, he attended classes diligently for three years and is now reading at a high school level. Becoming a reader has changed his life. He has received several promotions at work, and his everyday life has benefited in many ways as well. At a recent breakfast with his colleagues, an article in a local newspaper lying on the table caught his eye. Since it concerned a friend, he began reading it aloud. As he describes it, “Reading aloud in front of my colleagues was a very exciting thing for me to do.” He is now able to read and select a birthday card for his wife, fill out medical record forms in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_411" title="411"/>his physician’s office, and complete entry forms to participate in his beloved hobby of motocross racing. Previously he would go to the track, ask for an entry form, and with much embarrassment take it, fold it, place it in his pocket, and with head down quickly walk out the door, hoping that “none of the guys noticed.” His wife would complete the form for him at home later. This has all changed; now he can “read any word.” He continues to attend the night classes, where he often teaches new tutors how to pronounce the sounds of different letter groups. He envisions attending community college one day and taking courses in computer repair.</p>
			<p class="indent">One adult I came to know enrolled in a program in large part because she wanted to be able to read bedtime stories to her new granddaughter. Another student longed to be able to read aloud in her Bible study class. Each succeeded in reaching her goal.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you know someone who could benefit from further reading instruction, there are a number of things you can do to help. For example, there are more materials than ever for adults with limited reading skills, including a weekly newspaper, <i>News for You</i> (<a href="http://www.newreaderspress.com/news-for-you">www.newreaderspress.com/news-for-you</a>), published by the New Readers Press, the publishing division of ProLiteracy International, and Thumbprint Mysteries, a collection of thirty easy-to-read books written in conjunction with the Mystery Writers of America, available from McGraw-Hill Contemporary Publishing (<a href="https://openlibrary.org/publishers/McGraw-Hill_Contemporary">openlibrary.org/publishers/McGraw-Hill_Contemporary</a>). More and more libraries now have special collections of books that are of high interest to adults and can be read by those with lower-level reading skills. Ask your local librarian about them.</p>
			<p class="indent">The General Education Development (GED) diploma is meant for students who did not graduate from high school but want to pursue further education or jobs that require a high school diploma or its equivalent. Obtaining a GED diploma requires passing a rigorous examination, revised in 2014 to align with Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for high school as part of the Department of Education career and college readiness expectations. The goal is a highly positive one: to help ensure that students have the skills and knowledge needed to enter a range of professions and occupations and attend colleges and universities. Three possible scores can be obtained:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p class="hanging0">GED Passing Score: at or higher than the minimum needed to demonstrate high school equivalency–level skills and abilities</p>
				<p class="hanging0">GED College Ready: demonstrates the skills and abilities needed to enroll in credit-bearing college courses</p>
				<p class="hanging0"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_412" title="412"/>GED College Ready + Credit: may be eligible for up to ten hours of college credit</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">The 2019 GED consists of four content areas: reasoning through language arts, mathematical reasoning, science, and social studies. <span id="ftn-166"/>Reflecting the imprint of the CCSS, the tests incorporate what are regarded as “clear signposts indicating what is most important for college and career readiness.” The goal is to provide students with what is required for postsecondary academic success and to obtain the “key college- and career-ready knowledge and skills [that] are closely linked to being able to get the training necessary to earn a living wage in high-growth industries.” The hope is that by integrating the college and career readiness standards into adult education programs, students will be prepared for and able to enter postsecondary training without the need for remediation.</p>
			<p class="indent">To repeat: The GED calls for tenth-grade reading skills and academic knowledge. Students preparing for the GED may enroll in literacy classes first to bring their reading levels up and then register for practice classes focusing specifically on the components of the GED. <span id="ftn-167"/>A GED practice test is available from the GED Testing Service. Accommodations are granted for those who require extra time. If the individual has previously received accommodations from a standardized testing agency, there should be no need for retesting. If an audio version of the test is requested, this usually requires additional time and should be requested as an accommodation. The GED has taken on additional significance given that many jobs, including those generally regarded as low-skilled, require a high school diploma or GED, with many industrial jobs requiring a preemployment assessment such as a Career Readiness Certificate (CRC). For more information, visit the official website of the GED Testing Service, <a href="http://www.ged.com">www.ged.com</a>.</p>
			<p class="indent">Adult education teachers can often customize their instruction. A growing number of companies (and unions) are sponsoring targeted reading instruction at the workplace itself. Participation is highly motivating; instruction focused on the most common words found in work-related materials can allow a worker to function more easily at his job or help him to move on to the next level, as Carmine did. These programs are short but intense, ranging from thirty to sixty hours over an eight- to ten-week period. Tom Sticht, who developed highly successful literacy programs for the army in the 1970s, believes that such work-related programs are especially effective because of their relevance to the person’s life goals. A student quickly experiences <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_413" title="413"/>tangible results, such as reading a cookbook if he wants to be a chef or a plumbing manual if he wants to repair pipes.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>LIVING LIFE AS AN UNDIAGNOSED, VERY BRIGHT DYSLEXIC ADULT</b></h2>
			<p>So what is it like to be a bright dyslexic adult, one who was not diagnosed until he was well into middle age and who continues to struggle with reading to this day?</p>
			<p class="indent">Perhaps the worst impact of having a low level of literacy, no matter how intelligent the person is, is that it robs him of his self-esteem. As I have noted often in these pages, many in our society mistakenly confuse slow reading with slow thinking, when nothing could be further from the truth. As a society, we have a responsibility to screen and to diagnose dyslexia early, since we now have the tools to do so. The urgent need for it was brought home to me recently. I am very proud of my university, Yale, for the depth of its understanding of dyslexia and its resultant actions. Our Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity serves as a referral center for students needing assessments. As part of this process, a student had been referred who was registered for an online course at Yale which required him to come to Yale once a month, and whose professor thought he might benefit from an in-depth assessment. I review each of these evaluations, and as I was going through this particular one, I was struck by the student’s level of intelligence—highly superior, in the ninety-eighth percentile—in contrast to his very low scores in phonological processing and reading. Here was a classic example of the definition of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">He was fifty-four years old. I phoned him, identified myself, and shared with him the results of his tests, which showed that he was dyslexic—and brighter than 98 percent of the population. “Are you sure you have the right person?” he asked. I assured him I did. I didn’t hear anything from him for several seconds, so I asked, “Are you there?” “I am, but I’m crying,” came the reply. I started shedding tears as well.</p>
			<p class="indent">We met in person a few weeks later when he was on campus. Here’s what he shared with me:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					Yes, I have very low self-esteem. So many people told me I wasn’t very smart. Early in school I was placed in a class with intellectually <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_414" title="414"/>deficient children, and all we did was crafts and things like that. It made me feel horrible. I can still remember as a little boy going to Sunday school every Sunday and they would go around the room and you would have to read. It was a requirement, and I was humiliated each Sunday when I would be called upon to read. And it didn’t go away. I remember even into college, if I knew that we were going to have to read a section, if they were going around the room selecting people to read and we were going up and down the row, I would go to the bathroom. I would not be present when it was my turn to read—that was in graduate school, for my master’s.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">He had compensated to a fantastic degree. He was going for a doctorate-level degree now. He had essentially memorized words in his specialty.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Yes, but at a cost. I can’t do it—read these words automatically. Reading makes me totally exhausted, and I will sleep for a long period of time, which my friends say is abnormal. There are so many things. I would love to be able to watch foreign films, but I can’t read the subtitles fast enough. The guidance counselor in high school told me I needed to select a technical field because I read so slowly and with such great effort.</p>
				<p class="indent">I would really like to be in a situation where I could express my creativity and my intelligence without worrying about the image I have to portray. I feel like I can’t be myself, that I have all these personas I have to show to other people. I have to hide my dyslexia so that they don’t think I am not smart. I have a work persona—an exterior, if you will—that’s very stressful to maintain, but with you, when I come in here, I don’t have any walls, I would tell you anything about me. It feels like a safe environment, and that’s one of the things when I first came here to test, I said, for the first time in my life, I know that I am going to be totally honest with the tests. This visit has opened the door, because even though I thought I was smart, this has validated that it just wasn’t my wish or dream; it is real. What would make me happy is to be able to go to work every day and help people without having to worry about how I’m going to be perceived. It would mean that I could be the real me and that would be okay.</p>
				<p class="indent">The beginning of my career I worked in a tertiary-care trauma <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_415" title="415"/>center. So the patients were really, really sick. After a while I was always the one leading the cardiac codes and doing that. I didn’t have to read it. I could react faster than I can tell you.</p>
				<p class="indent">There are so many things, so many work-arounds that I have had to do to allow me to move forward on my intelligence so that I would not be stopped by my lack of a strong ability to read. For example, the GRE. I got around the GRE—if I had to take the GRE, I would not be able to go to grad school. Here’s how I did it—the MSN [master of science in nursing] program accepted me as long as I had a certain GPA, 3.5 or something. The same thing here, at Yale. I didn’t have to take the GRE for the degree I am aiming for, doctor of nursing practice. If it had been the Ph.D. program, I would have had to register for and take the GRE. The irony is that I would function better in the Ph.D. program because I love research and I would love to write.</p>
				<p class="indent">Dyslexia is a really important part of my life, but I have real concerns about disclosing it. People have their preconceived perceptions. If I had a wish, it would be to have been diagnosed as dyslexic way earlier and then received the reading instruction I would need to become a good reader, so that my intelligence and reading ability would be aligned together, and that I could truly be myself, inside and outside. How much easier life would have been for me. On the other hand, I am relieved and even happy to know that it is not too late, and that there are still things I can do to help me be a better reader.</p>

			<p class="indent">While early is always better, it truly is never too late. Acclaimed dyslexic crime novelist Amanda Kyle Williams did not read her first book until she was twenty-three years old. As a child, she struggled to read even the simplest sentences. Teachers described her as anxious; her family thought she was lazy, slow, or stupid. She dropped out of high school and became addicted to cocaine. She did not discover that she was dyslexic until she was twenty-two. <span id="ftn-168"/>“The diagnosis changed every way I felt about myself and every way I felt about my chances in the world,” she said. “I lived in that undiagnosed, unsupported world for many years. When you grow up feeling dumb, being told you’re not trying or not smart enough to do what is asked of you in school, it marks you. It just does.” Sadly, Williams passed away in 2018.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_416" title="416"/><b>MORE HOPE ON THE HORIZON FOR ADULT DYSLEXICS</b></h2>
			<p>A major effort is now under way to develop breakthrough technology—software—for mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets that would bring about significant improvement in the user’s reading skills.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 2014, Bennett and I were invited to join the advisory board of the Adult Literacy XPRIZE. As described by the XPRIZE Foundation, the XPRIZE is “the world’s leader in designing and managing incentive competitions to solve humanity’s grand challenges.” Adults with low literacy, primarily dyslexic adults, are the targeted beneficiaries of this grand challenge, along with a sizable group of people whose native language is not English, the English language learners (ELLs). One hundred fifteen teams competed, and as I write this, the grand prize has just been announced and is shared by two teams: Learning Upgrade (San Diego, California) and People ForWords (Dallas, Texas). These two teams, along with two other teams—AmritaCREATE, Amrita University (Amritapuri, Kerala, India) and Cell-Ed (Oakland, California)—were also selected to compete for the second phase of the competition, to test the practical applications of the apps in communities with a high prevalence of dyslexic adults. AutoCognita (Hong Kong) was also one of the finalists. These apps generated the greatest gains between a pre- and post-test to both native English-speakers and English-language learners who initially were reading English at a third-grade level or below. Specific details are provided in the Appendix.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even in our increasingly technical society, it’s still all about reading: instructional manuals for the workplace, for computers, for cars, for putting together children’s toys; directions for taking medications, for making up baby formulas, for safety, for voting; messages via mail, email, the Internet, pager, and fax. Learning to read opens the door to a brighter, better future, and given the effective programs to teach reading at all levels of reading ability and at all ages, it really is never too late to learn to read.</p>
