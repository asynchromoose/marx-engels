			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>HELPING YOUR CHILD BREAK THE READING CODE</b></h1>
			<p>One of the most exciting things to happen to your child between the time he enters kindergarten and the time he leaves the next spring is that he breaks the reading code. To do so, he must solve the two parts of the reading puzzle: one involving spoken language, the other written language. For the past five thousand or so years, since man has been reading, each potential reader has faced the same challenge.</p>
			<p class="indent">To solve the first part of the puzzle, each would-be reader must begin to understand that spoken words come apart and that they are made up of very small bits of language. As you read earlier, these tiny particles of language are called phonemes, and the development of this insight about words is called phonemic awareness. Once a child appreciates that spoken words can be pulled apart into distinct sounds, he is well on his way to solving the spoken-language part of the reading code. Then he is ready to take the next big step: figuring out how printed letters link to these sounds—for example, knowing that the first sound of the spoken word <i>sat, ssss,</i> is represented by the letter <i>s</i>, and the final sound, <i>t,</i> by the letter <i>t</i>.” And then one day he solves the puzzle: He makes the critical insight that the written word <i>sat</i> has the same number and sequence of sounds, <i>ssss, aah, t,</i> as the spoken word <i>sat,</i> and that the letters represent these sounds. He has broken the reading code! The child has mastered the alphabetic principle. He is ready to read.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208" title="208"/>This step is terribly important, because once a child knows the code, printed words are no longer a mystery. He has a <i>strategy</i>—he knows how to link the letters to the sounds they represent and then to blend the sounds together to read the word. He applies his knowledge of how letters relate to sounds to analyze and to read more and more unfamiliar words. This is referred to as <i>decoding.</i> The better and better a child gets at decoding words, the more accurate his reading becomes. A child who knows how to sound out printed words is freed from having to memorize every word he wants to be able to read. Sounding out words allows him to unlock the mystery of reading and to read words he has never before seen.</p>
			<p class="indent">Recent brain research allows us to link our understanding of the sequence of steps a child goes through in learning to read both to the work that must go on within the brain to solve the reading code and to the teaching of reading. Within the brain, the child is literally building the neural circuitry that links the <i>sounds</i> of spoken words, the phonemes, to the print code, the <i>letters</i> that represent these sounds. A major role of kindergarten is to provide a child with the kinds of experiences that allow him to build those brain connections as accurately, as strongly, and as quickly as possible.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PART ONE OF THE CODE: SOUND ADVICE</b></h2>
			<p>
				At the very beginning stage of reading, the initial goal is to draw the child’s attention to the <i>sounds</i> of language. It is important to keep in mind that children will vary in their progress along this road. Some will need to go through each step slowly, while others progress much more rapidly, not requiring instruction in every step of the process. At this stage, a major focus is to help a child to develop <i>phonemic awareness</i>—that is, the ability to notice, to count, to identify, and to manipulate the tiniest particles of language making up words.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Phonemic awareness,</i> the most important and sometimes most difficult task in learning to read, is the foundation of all subsequent reading and spelling instruction. Teaching it requires only a small part of the school day, but children in kindergarten and often even in preschool benefit from learning phonemic awareness. Progressively, a child’s attention is drawn to the sounds in words, first through noticing rhymes, then by comparing sounds in different words, and finally by learning how to “work on words,” pulling them apart, pushing them together, and moving the parts around <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209" title="209"/>within the word. While phoneme awareness refers to the sounds of spoken words, it often helps to use letters to emphasize the different sounds and to facilitate transferring this skill to reading. <i>Always keep in mind that we are teaching phonemic awareness not as an end in itself but because of its central importance in helping a child understand the relation of letters to sounds and, ultimately, to becoming a reader.</i></p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>STEP ONE: DEVELOPING AN AWARENESS OF RHYME</b></h3>
			<p>
				The very first step for a child is to develop a growing awareness that words can rhyme. Tuning into rhymes sensitizes very young children to the fact that words come apart. For example, to know that the words <i>fig</i> and <i>jig</i> rhyme, a child must attend to just a part of each word—the ending, <i>ig.</i> The child begins to appreciate that words have parts. His natural joy in playing with rhymes (words ending with the same sound) and alliteration (a series of two or more words beginning with the same initial sound, such as <i>click, clack, clock</i>) helps to lay the groundwork for teaching phonemic awareness.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can help sensitize a child to rhyme by reading stories and poems to him aloud. One richly illustrated rhyming book he will enjoy is <i>Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo</i> by Kevin Lewis and Daniel Kirk. Listen:</p>
			<p class="poetry1 stanza">Chugga-chugga</p>
			<p class="poetry1">choo-choo,</p>
			<p class="poetry1">whistle blowing,</p>
			<p class="poetry1">whoooooooo! whoooooooo!</p>
			<p class="spaceabove">And</p>
			<p class="poetry1 stanza">Into tunnels, underground.</p>
			<p class="poetry1">See the darkness. Hear the sound.</p>
			<p class="poetry1">Chugga-chugga choo-choo, echo calling,</p>
			<p class="poetry1">whoooooooo! whoooooooo!</p>
			<p class="poetry1">whoooooooo! whoooooooo!</p>
			<p class="spaceabove">Children often love to pump their fist up and down as they make the sounds of the train whistle.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are many books you can read with your child. Knowing you are building a foundation provides added incentive for making reading aloud a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210" title="210"/>routine part of your special time together. In the Appendix you will find a list of children’s books that joyfully play with the sounds of language.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is great fun to read children’s books aloud with your child. As he listens to them, or even joins in singing these little ditties, he is taking a step toward becoming a reader. Professor Hallie Yopp Slowik, codirector of the Center for the Advancement of Reading and Writing at California State University, Fullerton, suggests some activities that children can enjoy as they listen to the stories. First, she says, “read the story aloud several times simply for the pure joy of reading and sharing.” Then draw the child’s attention to the sounds. (I can hear children giggle as they listen to C. P. Ochs’s <i>Moose on the Loose,</i> about the zookeeper who runs through the town of Zown asking anyone if they’ve seen a “moose on the loose in a chartreuse caboose.”) As you read these stories, simple comments such as “Isn’t it funny that so many of the words rhyme?,” along with specific examples, help to stimulate rhyme awareness. You can also ask your child to predict the next word in a rhyming story or ask if she notices that all the words in a sentence begin with the same sound: “Listen to the beginning sounds in these words: <i>Pink pigs picked pretty petals.</i> What sound do you hear? Yes, the <i>p</i> sound. What are some other words that begin with that sound?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Here are some more selections you can practice reading to your child. I’ve chosen one of my children’s favorites, <i>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</i> by Dr. Seuss:</p>
			<p class="poetry1 stanza">Bump!</p>
			<p class="poetry1">Bump!</p>
			<p class="poetry1">Bump!</p>
			<p class="poetry1">Did you ever ride a Wump?</p>
			<p class="poetry1">We have a Wump</p>
			<p class="poetry1">with just one hump.</p>
			<p class="indent spaceabove">Or some children may prefer <i>Madeline</i> by Ludwig Bemelmans, also written in rhyme. Here he describes little Madeline:</p>
			<p class="poetry1 stanza">She was not afraid of mice—</p>
			<p class="poetry1">she loved winter, snow, and ice.</p>
			<p class="poetry1">To the tiger in the zoo</p>
			<p class="poetry1">Madeline just said, “Pooh-pooh,”</p>
			<p class="poetry1">and nobody knew so well</p>
			<p class="poetry1">how to frighten Miss Clavel.</p>
			<p class="spaceabove"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211" title="211"/>As you read these rhyming stories aloud, it helps if you exaggerate the sound of the rhyming words.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>STEP TWO: WORKING ON WORDS</b></h3>
			<p>After getting to know rhymes and developing the sense that words have parts, children are ready for the next big step on the road to reading—taking words apart and putting them back together.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Pulling apart a word into its sounds is often referred to as <i>segmenting.</i></p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Pushing sounds together to form a word is called <i>blending.</i></p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">These are the two key processes involved in learning to spell and to read. In spelling, a child segments the spoken word into its sounds and transforms each sound into a letter. In reading, the letters are converted into sounds which are then <i>blended</i> together to form the word. Working on words forms the central focus of reading programs for young children. Just as a surgeon must learn the smallest details of human anatomy, budding readers must develop a keen awareness of the internal anatomy of spoken and printed words.</p>
			<p class="indent">In practice, children are introduced to the sounds of language gradually. Most reading programs begin by showing the child how to dissect words into their biggest chunks of sounds, syllables, and then introduce the smaller pieces, phonemes.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Separating Words into Syllables.</i> There are good reasons to begin with syllables. They are the largest units of sound that make up a word, and they are relatively easy for children to identify and manipulate within words. They readily come apart. One activity that helps a child pull apart the sounds in a word is to count (actually clap) the number of syllables in his own name: <i>A…ri</i> (clap, clap). <i>Jon…a…than</i> (clap, clap, clap). <i>Ev…a</i> (clap, clap). <i>Kay…la</i> (clap, clap).</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, children can take turns clapping out the syllables for each day of the week (<i>Tues…day</i>), each month of the year (<i>Sep…tem…ber</i>), recognizable objects (<i>cow…boy, scare…crow</i>), and fun words such as <i>cucumber</i> (<i>cu…cum…ber</i>) or Cinderella (<i>Cin…der…el…la</i>) or <i>Frozen</i> (<i>Fro…zen</i>).</p>
			<p class="indent">Children can also practice pushing syllables together to form words: “Can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212" title="212"/>you tell me what word <i>rain…bow</i> makes?” (<i>rainbow</i>). “What about <i>a…corn</i>?” (<i>acorn</i>). A child can be asked to blend the sounds of her own name: “What word does <i>Mi…mi</i> make? (<i>Mimi</i>). If you have any questions about the number of syllables in a word, you can always consult the dictionary.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Separating Syllables into Phonemes.</i> As I noted above, separating words into syllables is relatively easy—the words are already perforated and readily come apart. The next major step is appreciating that spoken words can be pulled apart into even finer divisions—phonemes. This is difficult for most beginning readers, and particularly so for dyslexic children.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the most effective programs, children first practice comparing or matching sounds in different words. The aim is to start a child thinking about how the sounds in these words compare to one another. Always begin by asking him to match the very first sounds in words, and then the final sounds. It is often helpful to have a set of cards with pictures of everyday objects (such as a map, man, knee, cat, dog, mom, mitt, can, cup, tag, top). You can cut the pictures out of a magazine and paste each one on a card or you can use those from children’s board games.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can begin by asking your child to identify the first sound in a word such as <i>map.</i> Show him a picture of a map, clearly saying, “This is a <i>mmmap</i>.” Ask him to name the picture. Next say, “The first sound in <i>mmmap</i> is <i>mmmm</i>. Can you say the first sound?” Then lay out four or five picture cards, some beginning with the <i>mmmm</i> sound. Ask him to say the names of each of the pictures and then to group together all the objects beginning with the <i>mmmm</i> sound.</p>
			<p class="indent">You may also show him three picture cards with, for example, a fan, a dog, and a cake, and ask him to name each picture. Then ask, “Can you show me which one of these pictures begins with the <i>d</i> sound?” You can point to one of the pictures (dog), name it, and then ask, “Can you find something else in the room that also begins with the same <i>d</i> sound?” Or you can simply ask him to produce a word that begins with the same sound as a target word: “Can you tell me a word that begins with the same sound as <i>ssssnake</i>?” (<i>sit, soup</i>, and <i>smile</i>). Sound-matching games are relatively easy, because they do not require the child to manipulate phonemes—ideal for the budding reader in kindergarten.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once a child is successful at matching sounds, he is ready for the more difficult task of pulling apart words: first the beginnings, then the endings, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213" title="213"/>and then the middle sounds. Children first carry out these kinds of activities with spoken words, and then they progress to games involving the letters and sounds making up written words.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are all sorts of ways you can pull words apart. You can ask your child to clap for the number of sounds he hears in a word. For example, you can say, “<i>Ssss…ee, see.</i> Clap for the number of sounds you hear—<i>ssss…ee, see.</i>” She should clap twice for two sounds, <i>ssss</i> and <i>ee</i>. Most kindergartners seem to be successful in separating the sounds in two-phoneme words such as <i>eat, it, say,</i> and <i>zoo,</i> but they are stymied when asked to pull apart even relatively simple three-phoneme words such as <i>fan</i> and <i>mop.</i> So go slowly. Start with the most basic two-phoneme words and then work your way up to three or more sounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">You could also add a sound: “What word do you get if you add the sound <i>t</i> to the word see? (<i>seat</i>). You could take away a sound, first a beginning sound: “What word do you get if you take the <i>ssss</i> sound from the word <i>seat</i>?” (<i>eat</i>). Then take away an ending sound: “Can you say <i>seat</i> without the <i>t</i> sound?” (<i>see</i>).</p>
			<p class="indent">These tasks require segmentation. The converse, phoneme blending, is one of the most important and surprisingly difficult jobs for the beginning reader to master. (Recall that in reading, a child must transform the letters to sounds and then blend the sounds together to form the word.) So you may want to practice blending activities at home with your child. One method is to line up three pictures, such as a man, a map, and a fan. Choose a word represented by one of the pictures, for example, <i>man,</i> and slowly pronounce each of its sounds: <i>mmmm…aah…n.</i> Ask your child to point to the picture that shows the word made by pushing these sounds together.</p>
			<p class="indent">For a slightly more difficult variant, rather than asking your child to point, you can ask him to tell you, to say, the word made by pushing these sounds together.</p>
			<p class="indent">For both segmenting and blending activities, you can use the following two- and three-phoneme words.</p>

			<h3 class="head"><b>HINTS FOR BUILDING SUCCESS</b></h3>
			<p>The goal of these activities is to draw your child’s attention to the smallest parts of words. Here are some of the things you might want to keep in mind as you do so:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>You want your child’s active involvement. When you have it, he is paying attention and learning is going on. The activities should be short and enjoyable. If he is not interested, let it go; little is accomplished if he sits there passively with you talking at him. Try to do these activities when both you and he are alert and in a good mood.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>You want him to notice each word or word part you say, so speak slowly and clearly and pronounce each sound very carefully.</p>

Your child should indicate how many sounds he hears in a word by the number of coins (or blocks) he places on the table. For example, for the two-phoneme word <i>zoo,</i> he would say each sound (<i>zzzz, oo</i>) as he lays out one and then a second coin (see Figure 42).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Make up your own jingles, rhymes, or silly stories to highlight a particular sound, or even sing a song together. Funny and visually absurd rhymes and alliterations often work best in making a sound more salient to the child.

			<p>Once a child has learned about the segmental nature of spoken words and is becoming familiar with individual sounds, she is ready for letters. Most children have already learned to sing the ABC song as preschoolers and enter kindergarten knowing the names of most of the letters. In kindergarten, knowledge of the letters is reinforced—not only their shapes and names but their sounds. By the second half of the kindergarten year, most children can identify and print each of the letters. Now they can begin to use them for the purpose of reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">Learning about and using different sound and letter combinations to decode words is called <i>phonics.</i> In English there are more sounds than letters: about forty-four phonemes and twenty-six letters. These forty-four sounds provide the means by which the developing reader can attach letters and create print, or “visible speech.” Many children are ready for linking letters to sounds (phonics instruction) as early as kindergarten, and nearly all children by first grade.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217" title="217"/>When Barbara Wilson, creator of the Wilson Reading System, was speaking at a Connecticut conference, I thought she made an important observation on teaching phonics when she said to teach the sounds in two directions. In the first one, have the child listen to the sound and ask her what letter represents that sound. For example, say “tuh,” and the child should respond saying or pointing to the letter <i>t.</i> In the other direction, the child looks at the letter <i>t</i> and then says “tuh.” Learning a sound and its letter concurrently reinforces the association and helps to ensure that the connection is firm.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>THE A TO Z OF TEACHING BEGINNING READING</b></h3>
			<p>Although awareness of sounds and letters is necessary, children also need practice in reading stories. They need to apply their newly acquired skills to sounding out and decoding familiar and less familiar words, to reading words in sentences and in books, and to focusing on understanding the meaning of the word and the sentence.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Practice.</i> <span id="ftn-121"/>Brain imaging technology shows the powerful positive effect of practice in creating neural circuits related to the development of what scientists call expertise or skill. Basically, the brain learns by practice. The old dictum about the importance of practice, practice, practice turns out to be correct. Whether it is for learning how to pitch, to play a musical instrument, or to read, it is critical for the development and refinement of the components of the neural systems for reading. Once a child gains an awareness of how letters relate to sounds, he benefits greatly from putting into practice what he has just learned.</p>
			<p class="indent">After an introduction to the specific letter-sound relationships, the next critical step is for a child to practice the words, both in isolation and then in reading simple sentences and books. To improve his accuracy, a child needs to practice reading, both silently and especially out loud to others. Each time he stumbles on a specific word while reading aloud and with his teacher’s or parents’ guidance makes corrections and refinements, he is establishing and integrating increasingly more accurate representations of that word’s components within his brain. His internal representation of the word reflects the integration of those neural systems serving pronunciation, spelling, and meaning. Writing the word and learning to spell it also contribute to establishing increasingly accurate representations of that word in his neural circuitry.</p>
			<p class="indent">Learning spelling-sound patterns, practicing them in different words and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" title="218"/>in reading books, learning how to form letters and to spell the words—all contribute to forging and then reinforcing the connections that will eventually form the neural code for that word. Beginning readers are trying to solve the mystery of the unknown word. The more clues there are, the greater the chances of solving the mystery—and the more likely the child is to recognize the word when he comes across it again.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even kindergartners, on the cusp of literacy, can practice their new skills. Children love to read even when they know only a few word patterns. Simple booklets, about twelve to twenty-four pages—so-called decodable texts (containing the words with letter-sound patterns that a child has already been taught)—can help him apply his newfound skills by actually reading words in a book. The Bob Books series by Bobby Lynn Maslen is a good example. Many children enjoy the series, not only in print but also on their tablets in the digital version. Other decodable texts are part of reading series, such as S.P.I.R.E. Decodable Readers, available from EPS Publishers; Scholastic Decodable Readers, from <a href="http://Scholastic.com">Scholastic.com</a>; and Ready Reader and Reading Street, both available from Pearson. All of these provide increasingly complex reading material, both fiction and nonfiction, in a very user-friendly format.</p>
			<p class="indent">A new approach, Readables, takes text for beginning readers to a new level. A wonderful example is Geodes, a new reading series providing books that build knowledge while developing a child’s skills for success and love of reading. This series presents an unusual array of topics for a beginning reader’s text, including science, history, visual art, and literature (found in the Great Minds Wit &amp; Wisdom<sup>®</sup> curriculum), while at the same time aligning with the scope and sequence of Wilson’s Fundations<sup>®</sup> program focused on decoding and word-recognition skills.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Sight Words.</i> Once a child learns about letter-sound relationships in specific words, he eventually generalizes and uses these principles to read other, new words that have the same letter pattern and are pronounced in the same way. So if a child can read <i>cat</i> and is able to divide it into <i>c-at,</i> he will also be able to decode other words in the same <i>at</i> family—<i>mat, sat, bat.</i> With time, he will go on to acquire knowledge of more and more complex word families.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, difficulty sometimes comes where you least expect it. I am thinking of words such as <i>a, is, are, one, two, said, again, been, could, the,</i> and <i>once,</i> which pop up frequently in books for young children but don’t seem to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219" title="219"/>follow the rules. These words do not follow a pattern and cannot be sounded out. Consequently, they must be committed to memory and recognized on sight; not surprisingly, they are often referred to as <i>sight words.</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c17-ftn-1" id="c17-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> (Because of the inconsistencies in their letter-sound linkages, they are sometimes called “irregular” words.) Since sight words are sure to be found in children’s books, it is important that they become part of a child’s reading vocabulary at a very early stage. Making flash cards (actual hard copies) or digital (such as Quizlet, <a href="http://quizlet.com">quizlet.com</a>) and reviewing them regularly helps in learning these common words. Having a child print his own card and say the word as he writes it often helps to reinforce its pronunciation. (A list of the most common sight words appears on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c18_r1.xhtml#page_245">this page</a>.)</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Writing Letters.</i> Recognizing and writing letters represents a major milestone in learning to read. Emphasis is directed toward writing lowercase letters, because they are more common. Once children can write letters, no matter how poorly, they can engage in a variety of writing exercises that further encourage awareness of the sounds making up words and of how letters represent these sounds. A child’s writing out his own name and then common words such as <i>dog, mom,</i> and <i>dad</i> reinforces that awareness. Early on in kindergarten, children can use alphabet blocks or letter cards to “write” the words. By the time the children are ready to leave kindergarten, they are using letters to spell words phonetically, although not necessarily correctly. These earliest attempts at such spellings are referred to as “invented” or temporary spelling.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Spelling.</i> Spelling is intimately linked to reading, not only because sounds are being linked to letters but because words are being encoded—literally put into a code instead of merely being deciphered or decoded. As I said earlier, in spelling, the spoken word is being pulled apart into its sounds and then each sound is encoded, transformed into the letters representing that sound. Invented spelling functions as a transitional step as kindergartners are trying their hand at matching letters to sounds. When children are trying <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220" title="220"/>to form printed words based on the sounds they hear in spoken words, it is a good indication that they are on the road to reading. This is why in kindergarten and in the beginning of first grade children are encouraged to practice “invented spelling” and to write a word as they think it sounds—for example, <i>knd</i> for <i>candy, hrs</i> for <i>horse,</i> or <i>kt</i> for <i>cat.</i> As you can see in these examples, beginning readers most commonly omit vowel sounds. So a child’s invented spelling for the word <i>house</i> might well progress from <i>hs</i> to <i>hws</i> to <i>house.</i> Notice that the pronunciation of the invented spelling is very close to that of the intended word. A child may have the sounds down, but he has not quite mastered the link between letters and sounds. In kindergarten, that’s okay.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Listening, Playing, and Imagining.</i> A kindergarten child’s reading program is rounded out by a range of activities that enhance her language skills and her enjoyment of literature. Whether at school or at home, being surrounded by books, listening to stories read aloud, talking about the characters and events in the story, and playing with blocks or puppets all help a child to develop her thinking skills and her imagination, to build her vocabulary, and to become aware of the world around her.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reading and word knowledge are mutually reinforcing. Reading builds a child’s vocabulary, and knowledge of word meanings helps in decoding words and improves reading comprehension. A primary goal of reading is to get to the printed word’s meaning. To do so requires a child first to decode the word and then to have the word in his vocabulary. Initially, the words a child is learning to read are quite simple and invariably in his oral vocabulary, but before long the words begin to get more complicated and unfamiliar. At this stage, knowing the meaning of a word helps to facilitate its decoding. As a child encounters an unfamiliar printed word, he tries out different pronunciations. For example, is the <i>i</i> in <i>ink</i> pronounced like the <i>i</i> in <i>ice</i> or like the <i>i</i> in it? (If he knows the meaning of the word <i>ink,</i> the chances are far more likely that he will pronounce it correctly.) So, obviously, the larger a child’s vocabulary, the more words—and the more difficult and complex words—he is going to be able to decipher and to read. It is never too early to introduce a child to new words and their meaning, which strengthens this key component of his neural model for each of the new words he encounters. Parents can help by making it a point to talk about each new word (or concept) you come across in a story, to define it in simple words, and then <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" title="221"/>to have your child use the word in a sentence. Learning about the meanings of new words reinforces a child’s worldly as well as his word knowledge, both key ingredients for strengthening his reading comprehension.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition to improving a child’s vocabulary, listening to stories has many other positive benefits for reading. At home, you can enhance these positive effects by having your daughter sit next to you as you read, watching as you point to each word as you pronounce it. She will soon notice that words that take longer to say look longer on the page. <i>Caterpillar</i> sounds longer than <i>cat</i> and looks longer when you see it printed on a page. Such observations help the child learn that the spoken word and the printed word are related. At a later stage she begins to associate the printed word with the sound and meaning of the spoken word. Eventually she will learn to use her finger to point to each of the words as you read them, and then she will want to read and point out the words herself. To get started, I suggest reading aloud the books listed in the Appendix under “Just Right for a Child on the Cusp of Reading.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Kindergarten children also love to make up stories and dictate them to their teacher or their parent, who magically transcribes each word onto paper. As a child dictates his little story and then watches as you point to and read each word back to him, he is learning to associate sound, letters, and meaning. He is building the integrated neural circuits necessary for reading. He is also building his imagination.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Self-confidence.</i> This is probably the most important ingredient in ensuring that a child is setting out on a good path. The most significant development for your child as he leaves kindergarten is how he feels about himself. A critical role of the kindergarten experience is to ensure that every child achieves some degree of success in what he does, that he receives positive comments from his teacher, and that he is encouraged. Without motivation and the sense that he can succeed, a child will have little reason to struggle as he tries to pull apart words that seem to be inseparable.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>IS YOUR CHILD MOVING FORWARD IN KINDERGARTEN?</b></h2>
			<p>
				It is important to pinpoint where your child is along the reading pathway and to keep in mind that each child is different. Rather than having a student <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222" title="222"/>try to keep up with (or slow down to) a pace that is uncomfortable for him, instruction must be fitted to the child.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reading instruction often begins in kindergarten, and once instruction begins, there are inevitable questions: Is the reading instruction approach working for the child? Is he making progress or is he falling behind? If he continues at this pace, what does this mean for his future as a reader?</p>
			<p class="indent">Even children whom one might assume do not need early assessment and monitoring should have it. Some especially bright children may appear to learn to read early and seem to leap frog over learning phonologic skills. These children simply memorize lots of words with seeming ease and quickly build a large reading vocabulary without learning how to analyze these words and pull them apart, let alone figure out how to pronounce a new or unfamiliar word. Invariably there comes a time when such children cannot decipher the insides of these new, relatively long words—especially technical names, as in the sciences (<i>bicarbonate, polynomial, stegosaurus</i>), or names of people or places in history or around the world (<i>Picasso, Lafayette, Laramie, Timbuktu, Kathmandu</i>). They lack a strategy to deal with them. So it is best to ensure that progress is carefully monitored.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: YOUR KINDERGARTEN STUDENT</b></h2>
			<p>In summary, you must first determine if your child or student is at-risk for dyslexia, making sure that his school uses an effective screener. It is important to make sure that his progress is being carefully monitored. At the end of kindergarten, you can ask yourself or your child’s kindergarten teacher, based on her own observations, if your child</p>

			<p class="indent">You should feel reassured if your child demonstrates these skills. It is even more solidly reassuring if she is found not to be at-risk following a kindergarten screening—a more reliable indicator that she is indeed off to a running start in reading.
