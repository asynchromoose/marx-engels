			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>A PERSON LIKE THAT…</b></h1>
			<p>Not long ago, at a dinner party, a professor at my table was speaking about dyslexia. “Now dyslexics want to go to law school,” he said. “Can you imagine: a person like that as your lawyer?” I smiled at him as I replied, “I would consider it fortunate to have David Boies as my personal attorney. Yes, I would be very lucky to have a person like that.” My misguided dinner companion went on. “Well, he couldn’t really be dyslexic. He’s…he’s too accomplished—he’s just too good to be dyslexic.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Of course this stereotype of dyslexia is false. The very same children who struggle with dyslexia in school often go on to excel in life. I want to introduce you to a diverse group of dyslexics who are successful by anyone’s standards in a range of occupations. As children these men and women struggled to read, could not spell, were laughed at when they read aloud in class, rarely finished a book, failed foreign-language courses, and fared miserably on standardized tests. Many dyslexic children and young adults will recognize themselves in these portraits. If so, they will also know that if they are “a person like that,” they should be encouraged to dream big, follow their dreams, and know that those dreams can and will come true.</p>
			<p class="indent">These portraits of highly successful dyslexic men and women provide insight into their early life, challenges, and failures, together with their resilience and their ultimate path to the very top of their fields.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_490" title="490"/><b>ATTORNEY</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DAVID BOIES</b></h3>
			<p><span id="ftn-216"/>David Boies is brilliant and a genuine thinker. His acumen and skill as an attorney have led to honor after honor, and praise such as “Brilliant and tireless, he may be the greatest trial lawyer alive today.” You read about his herculean work habits, including forgoing sleep in favor of preparing for a case. “Would you rather sleep or win?” he asks. His stunning win representing the U.S. Department of Justice in its antitrust case against Microsoft was characterized by David Margolick in <i>Vanity Fair</i> as “The Man Who Ate Microsoft.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Boies reads slowly but managed to graduate second in his class at Yale Law School. Along with Ted Olson, his co-lead counsel, he represented the plaintiffs in <i>Perry v. Brown</i> and was able to win rulings establishing the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed in the state of California. Insights into how this life-changing decision came about are found in Boies and Olson’s book, <i>Redeeming the Dream: The Case for Marriage Equality.</i> Boies is also the author of <i>Courting Justice,</i> providing his unique perspective on his many high-profile cases.</p>
			<p class="indent">Boies’s accomplishments strengthen and add credence to the Sea of Strengths model of dyslexia. He himself stresses the importance of dyslexic children knowing that there is</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>somebody who has dyslexia who can do this. It gives them a goal. It gives them a certainty that they can do it. And as with almost any characteristic, you have to identify it and identify that it is not disabling, and you have to see people who have that characteristic succeed.</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>It is a disability, but it does not have to be disabling.</i> And I think that as people see that more and more, society begins to recognize that people with dyslexia are not slow and they’re not dumb. They just process information differently. And then as we come to know them as their lawyer and their doctor and their patient and their client we begin to understand the basic reality, which is that we are all the same in every respect that matters. As more and more people have been identified as people with dyslexia and you realize that they are normal in every way that matters and that they can be just as successful and just as contributing to society as everybody else, those prejudices begin to disappear.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_491" title="491"/>Boies stresses that his work in law relies much more on thinking than on reading, and that is something, as a dyslexic attorney, he excels in. He urges people to understand that while <i>the intake (reading) is impacted by dyslexia, the dyslexic individual’s processing of information is a strength,</i> one enabling him as he matures not only to dream of accomplishing great things but to keep in mind that he <i>can and will accomplish his dream.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Boies is particularly concerned for dyslexics during their adolescence:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>In that vulnerable time you have doubts about yourself and your place in the world; it is the time when the input issue has the greatest impact. As you get older, processing takes over in importance.</p>
				<p class="indent">But when you’re in grade school and high school, you’re reading, you’re learning, you’re memorizing. You’re taking in all these facts, all these formulas, all these words, vocabulary. And you’re not at a point where the processing of that information dominates, as it does when you get out and into the real world. So at the very time that you are the most vulnerable psychologically, you are most inhibited by the dyslexia.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">When asked about the seemingly growing impact of having students take standardized tests, Boies expressed deep concern for the harm these can do, especially to students who are dyslexic and to society as a whole.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reflecting on the frequent sad state of affairs in schools where parents of dyslexic boys and girls are continually being admonished to wait until it “clicks in,” Boies says:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>No, the thing is, it doesn’t click in. If you’ve got the patience and your parents and your school have the patience, you will come to a point where your abilities are more important than your disabilities. Dyslexia is not something that indicates a lack of intelligence. If you can just get to the point where what matters is intelligence or what I like to call processing, as opposed to input, like reading, you’ll be fine.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Boies is very much aligned with the need for and benefit of specialized schools for dyslexic children, agreeing that in public schools teachers and others too often make incorrect assumptions, believing that if you give dyslexic students the right program, that will do it all. But it won’t.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_492" title="492"/>For dyslexic boys and girls, the need is for people who understand in their social studies and their math and their history classes just what it’s all about. And teachers can’t take a course and say, “Well, this is how you teach it and regurgitate it.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">He was impressed when he visited the Lab School to receive an award:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>One of the great things about the Lab School in Washington, DC, is that you have a whole group of people that are together and nobody feels inferior. Nobody feels dumb. The school is a true community; nobody is ashamed. There is not the tendency present [among students] at many nonspecialized schools to look for kids who are perceived as different and find a child to shame, to target, essentially saying, “Who can I make fun of because I feel so insecure?”</p>
				<p class="indent">I grew up in a rural town in the 1940s in northwestern Illinois. I didn’t learn to read until I was in third grade. Even if you didn’t read, you could pretty well memorize and pretend you were reading. So I didn’t grow up with any sense of failure or any sense of not being able to do something that was really important—which gave me a chance to really develop on my own and develop my own set of skills and to adapt.</p>
				<p class="indent">I think the single biggest misunderstanding is to associate reading with intelligence, to use reading in the early years as a good indicator of somebody’s intelligence. I think that a related misunderstanding is a belief that how somebody is able to cope in school when they are in grade school and high school is a good indicator of how they will cope in life. I think that there are some ways in which it is, but I think that, particularly for somebody with dyslexia, it is a very poor indicator because…in life, what matters is your judgment, your intelligence, that you’re willing to continue to try and learn, how you relate to people, your character and integrity, your work ethic.</p>
				<p class="indent">How fast you read has very little bearing on how well you do when you get out into the real world. And yet how fast you read, particularly if you’re painfully slow, as I was, can have a huge impact on how well you do in school, particularly in grade school and high school.</p>
				<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_493" title="493"/>I think the most important requirement in dealing with dyslexia is <i>patience.</i> I think it’s very hard for an adolescent to be patient in anything. And it’s very hard for parents to be patient about their children because you care so much about them. And yet <i>patience is, I think, the single most important ingredient of dealing with dyslexia.</i></p>
				<p class="indent">I was in my early thirties when I found out I was dyslexic. To be honest, I didn’t think a lot about it. By that time I’d graduated from law school and was already a partner in a law firm.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">I asked if law doesn’t require a great deal of reading.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I get asked this question a lot by people who are dyslexic and want to go to law school. <i>First, I’m a very good listener; I learned to listen.</i> When you don’t read a lot, you listen. And when you really learn to listen, you listen to people’s words. You listen to their inflection. You can tell what they think is important.</p>
				<p class="indent">In class, I could listen, I could figure things out just by being there. I’m also a verbal person. I talk. I can interact. And so I can engage the professor. When I don’t understand something, I can ask. For me, class and class participation were very important. I really learned an enormous amount there.</p>
				<p class="indent">When I went to law school, you learned by what is called the case method, which is you read these long cases, and you try to figure out what the law is from that. That’s valuable for understanding the legal process, how decisions are made, but if you’re smart, you can figure that out without reading book after book in class after class.</p>
				<p class="indent">I found that I understood the legal method. I understood legal reasoning. I probably read 10 percent as many pages as the average person, maybe even less. But I got a lot out of class, and I got a lot out of my little…I called them hornbooks, nutshell books, stuff that sort of told you what the basic principles are. And that allowed me to learn the principles of law, plus legal reasoning, and to apply that in a way that was much more creative than what other people were able to do.</p>
				<p class="indent">It’s not that different [in preparing cases]. There will sometimes be a case where you need to read, and my reading comprehension is really great because I go so slowly that I really learn it. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_494" title="494"/>means I read fewer things. In any area, there are only a handful of cases that are really important. One of the things I’ve done for forty years is if there’s an important principle, I’ll say to people, “Give me the three cases that are best for us and three cases that are worst for us.” I’ll read those cases, and I’ll usually understand. As a trial lawyer, what’s important is how you present your case. If you’re going to go to trial, all you have to do is make your best argument. And you can do that often without knowing every case that’s out there. In addition, when you get to a more senior position, what people are looking for is your judgment, your analytical ability. They’re not asking you to tell them on the fly the number of years you can have a trust in a particular jurisdiction. That’s something somebody can look up. I’ve said so many times, life is not a timed test. You get time that you need to figure out what you need to know.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">In listening to David Boies, I could appreciate his sea of strengths, his big-picture thinking, not being a slave to every little detail or to thinking linearly. For him, it’s seeing the whole and figuring out how the parts go together. It’s not the intake but the processing of the information, synthesizing the parts and bringing it all together.</p>
			<p class="indent">I have spoken to many very worried adults who are dyslexic. They have gone through college, law school, or medical school, and now they are so afraid of the workplace. I asked what advice David would give these worried people.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>You know, if you made it through school, the workplace is going to be a picnic, because the time that you are most disadvantaged by dyslexia is in the school environment. It is an environment with standardized timed tests. It’s an environment that puts a premium on how much information you can absorb and how fast you can absorb it. You get into the workplace, and it puts a premium on how you deal with people and how you can use the information that you have—you’re not at a disadvantage in that area. In some cases, I think you may be at an advantage.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">We spoke about our grandchildren, and I asked Boies if a future grandchild happened to be dyslexic, what would he wish for that child?</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_495" title="495"/>I would just wish patience, just patience and love, support and recognition that this was a passage. This was something you had to go through and <i>you do emerge at the end, not because you leave your dyslexia behind but because you leave behind the disadvantages of your dyslexia.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 class="head"><b>REBECCA ARAGON</b></h3>
			<p>Rebecca Aragon sums up her life by embedding within it a very powerful message: “Life has not been easy, that is true, but if it were I wouldn’t be here where I am today.” Aragon was born to a single mother, a Mexican immigrant, living in a facility for abused and unwed women in Los Angeles, where only about 10 percent of the newborns remained with their biological mothers and the others were given up for adoption. Rebecca’s mom, going against her social worker’s advice, chose to keep and raise her daughter.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>It was a poor upbringing, but a very enriched one, because I had to learn survival skills to get through elementary school, then through high school. I had reading problems, but I didn’t know what it was back then. I thought it was because English was not my first language. Spanish was. I didn’t learn to speak English until I was seven years old. I thought it was because it was a poor neighborhood and I didn’t have an opportunity to go to very good schools. I thought these were all socioeconomic problems.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-217"/>This belief that socioeconomic problems were to blame for her struggles is unfortunately widespread and can be harmful. Acceptance of this view takes away the need to try to figure out what is the root cause of a child’s reading struggles—to screen for and diagnose the child’s reading problem, which can then lead to the provision of evidence-based, effective interventions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rebecca Aragon is an attorney and dyslexic. She is a shareholder and an attorney at Littler Mendelson PC, where her practice focuses on leading complex litigation involved in employment law in federal and state courts. For the past several years she has been recognized as one of the top Southern California lawyers and has also been named one of the best lawyers in America in employment law.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					Discrimination, harassment, and other types of employment-related cases require a substantial face-to-face interaction with employees <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_496" title="496"/>and opposing counsel. These types of matters require as many people skills as reading skills to resolve issues for clients, which dovetails perfectly with my abilities. I may not have the ability to read words quickly, but I can read people in a nanosecond, which is far more important as a trial lawyer and negotiator.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">How did this woman traverse the space from poverty, poor English, and dyslexia to highly lauded attorney?</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I pressed forward, even though I was not able to read fast or accurately. I learned how to work hard. I don’t know what it was in me. I just never, ever, ever gave up. It was that struggle, that persistence, that helped me push forward, and I learned how to reach out to others for help.</p>
				<p class="indent">I got into Yale, was a slow reader at Yale, wanted to drop out. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I didn’t know I had dyslexia. I got through Yale, went to law school at Georgetown. The same thing happened again. It was very difficult for me. I studied all the time, had no social life but made it through.</p>
				<p class="indent">I took the California bar exam before the ADA was passed. There was no such thing as accommodations back in those dark ages, so I knew I wouldn’t pass the first time. I could not give up. My challenge was to find a position that did not require immediate bar passage, so I had to find a clerkship with a federal judge, which was, ironically, by far the hardest position to achieve after you graduate from law school.</p>
				<p class="indent">I had to take the bar exam four times. It took me longer to pass the California bar than to go through law school, and that’s because I could not read fast enough. It’s a timed examination. With persistence and a fighter attitude, I finally passed it.</p>
				<p class="indent">As a young attorney, I quickly learned I had to develop skills other than reading quickly. What was I good at? What was I not good at? One of the things I learned I was good at was oral advocacy. I was very good with people. I was very good in negotiations. I was very good in depositions, and these all required your ability to think on your feet. I was not good when I had to analyze one of those fine-print legal documents. I was not good at sitting in front of a computer or reading cases and statutes. I could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_497" title="497"/>do it, but it took a lot out of me. It meant I was working a full 24/7.</p>
				<p class="indent">I took my daughter to get a professional diagnosis [when she had reading problems], and I remember the doctor saying, “Rebecca, does anyone else in your family have dyslexia?” I said, “I think I might have.” I was tested and I was right. It’s been good, because I’ve been able to identify those things that could help me move along—I’m very proud of that—as well as my daughter, who is dyslexic.</p>
				<p class="indent">After being a practicing lawyer for thirty years and having worked my way up to being a top partner at an Am Law 100 law firm,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c34-ftn-1" id="c34-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> I can now say to my partners and to young associate lawyers, “I’m dyslexic.” I bring in the business, I do the work, clients are giving me class actions, so I now have the courage to say that I’m dyslexic. But as a young lawyer I certainly didn’t, because I knew that my ability to instill confidence in other partners and in clients was limited. There still is a bias and there still is a prejudice out there. So when I go out on a pitch to a big ABC corporation and they see my track record…I have to be very judicious when I say I’m dyslexic.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Aragon credits her success to her leadership ability, a special constellation of skills that creates a team with a range of abilities that complement and extend her own.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I have to surround myself with people much smarter than I am. I don’t have an ego. I learned how to delegate. I learned leadership skills. I’m not afraid to ask for help. In fact, I always have my hand out. <i>Can you help me? Can you help me?</i> I’m also one to give praise to people and share credit. When we do get a great result, it isn’t me who did it; it was the team. So it’s all about leadership skills. It’s taken a long while, but it’s made me who I am and I’m so grateful.</p>
				<p class="indent">One of the things I think being dyslexic does also, it develops your sense of empathy for others’ plights. You learn to look at people and situations in other ways. It’s like, <i>Okay, someone needs help, go ask Rebecca. She won’t say no.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_498" title="498"/>Aragon remembers her failures as a young adult and what they taught her.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I remember when I was at Yale I needed a summer job, so I managed to become a receptionist at a law firm. I was fired because I had to get the names of callers—spell them right—and then call them back. It would take me ten tries before I got the number right, because I couldn’t get the person’s name right. It was humiliating, but I learned not to get that kind of job again. I also observed the lawyers—trial lawyers—and I said to myself, <i>I can do that.</i></p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>BUSINESS: FINANCIAL SERVICES</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>CHARLES SCHWAB</b></h3>
			<p>As we learned earlier, Charles Schwab, who revolutionized the financial services business, is dyslexic.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>As a child, schoolwork never came easily for me. Reading and writing were particularly difficult. I was pretty good at math…. Though I didn’t know why at the time, I had to work three times as hard as other kids to accomplish the same thing.</p>
				<p class="indent">I flunked English at Stanford not once but twice…. I couldn’t write a composition. I couldn’t finish a book. I never read a novel. I struggled in French. I had taken Latin in high school, so I could memorize the things that were very logical and consistent, it was almost a math kind of thing. I didn’t know how bad I really was at language until I got to Stanford, and then the quantities of reading you had to deal with—they were just outrageous for me.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">“I couldn’t read aloud that well but I could talk and solve problems pretty well,” Schwab said to me, capturing both his difficulties and his sea of strengths.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I had this outgoing personality. I was shy but I was confident, and so that kept me going. I really just conned my way through it in some ways. I had good leadership skills, I had good ways with people.</p>
				<p class="indent">I also had strengths in thinking. I was great at conceptualizing. I was naturally good in science and math. And maybe the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_499" title="499"/>creative part of my brain was being used for imagining and for problem-solving. From the earliest part of my life I can remember thinking that I could solve almost anything. I felt that if I just thought about it, I could solve it. But I never pushed it, I never thought about it, because I was so poor at English.</p>
				<p class="indent">Even though I couldn’t read quickly, I could imagine things much faster than some other people who were stuck thinking sequentially. That helped me in solving complex business problems. I could visualize how things would look at the end of the tunnel.</p>
				<p class="indent">To get around my excruciatingly slow reading I always used, wherever I could, the abbreviated kinds of books, the ones that would give me a five-page synopsis. I learned about Classic Comics back in elementary school. And so as a student I invented my own “accommodations,” like relying on these comic books to “read” such assignments as <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> and <i>Ivanhoe.</i> I had very poor SATs and I never would have been admitted to Stanford on the basis of those. Fortunately, I was very good at golf.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Schwab knows firsthand about the impact of dyslexia on a child when he must read aloud in front of his classmates, who laugh, and “the kid just dies a thousand deaths.” Schwab’s greatest concern is the child’s self-esteem and the impact of dyslexia on children and families. He has never forgotten the overwhelming helplessness he and his wife, Helen, felt when one of their own children first experienced what was eventually diagnosed as dyslexia. As so often happens, the diagnosis in his child led to the diagnosis of dyslexia in himself. Schwab has been deeply touched by his personal experience with dyslexia and is dedicated to supporting efforts to bring more knowledge and understanding to the condition. I have been personally touched by his extraordinary efforts and generosity. In 2008, he and his wife established the Charles and Helen Schwab Professor in Dyslexia and Learning Development at Yale, which Bennett was appointed to and carries with pride.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Some of the kids feel as if they’re really stupid,” says Schwab. “If there is anything I’d want them to know, it is that they’re not stupid. Once they understand that they can feel better about themselves.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Schwab credits dyslexia for the kind of out-of-the-box, visionary thinking that led to his own business success. To learn more deeply about Schwab’s amazing business insight and the story of his founding of and journey with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_500" title="500"/>the Charles Schwab Corporation, including his dyslexia, a must-read is his new book, <i>Invested: Changing Forever the Way Americans Invest,</i> published by Currency in 2019. He demonstrates his extraordinary ability to get to the heart of an issue when he describes the rationale for providing accommodations to students who are dyslexic. “What you’re trying to do is to convey knowledge to these kids,” he says. “It’s not about trying to trick them out of success.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Schwab’s thinking about the importance of ensuring that dyslexic students receive the time they require on standardized tests is aligned with the opinions of the many accomplished dyslexic men and women who stress this, together with the importance of diagnosis, especially early diagnosis. For example, the Academy Award–winning producer (A <i>Beautiful Mind</i>) and dyslexic, Brian Grazer, says,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>The single most important thing is to change the educational system so that people get the diagnosis as early as possible, and they get the help that they need. I think the second thing, which is, I think, less important, but still important, is to break down the hierarchy of the standardized test. The first step is extra time. And extra time doesn’t really help a great deal if you’re not dyslexic. What it does is it equates the performance with the IQ for somebody who’s dyslexic. That’s what the test is supposed to do. The test is supposed to be testing your ability. By giving people with dyslexia the extra time, it makes the test more effective.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Most of all, Schwab wants to encourage dyslexic men and women to pursue their dreams.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>People who have a passion and have shown they can do the work should be encouraged to go on to the next level. With their passion, intellect, and compassion, they may be among the best lawyers and doctors.</p>
				<p class="indent">The important thing is to allow a person to focus on something he has a passion for. The more you focus on something, the more successful you are at it. I’m still a very slow reader of most things. I spend a lot of time on one subject, business, which is pretty boring to some people, but not to me. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> is one thing I know like the back of my hand, because I immerse myself <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_501" title="501"/>in it every day, and I know the language of business pretty well now. But when I go on vacation, I’ll be packing along a copy of <i>Shogun,</i> which is pretty tattered, and for the tenth time I’ll try to get through part of it. I’m still working on it, and it may take me another ten years to get through it all.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>ECONOMIST</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DIANE SWONK</b></h3>
			<p>As a student in elementary school in Livonia, Michigan, Diane Swonk struggled to carry out simple arithmetic such as adding a column of numbers or memorizing the times table. Now she is a highly regarded and sought-after economist who is looked up to for her expertise in developing complex economic models based on higher-level mathematics. She is chief economist and managing director for Grant Thornton, a global audit, tax advisory firm, and has earned a reputation as one of the most reliable economic forecasters in finance. Her expertise and judgment are highly valued, as indicated by her multiple top advisory roles for the Federal Reserve Board, the Congressional Budget Office’s panel of economic advisors, and the Council on Foreign Relations, among others.</p>
			<p class="indent">Diane’s dyslexia was discovered when she was in fourth grade. As her parents watched her, there was little doubt that Diane was also extremely gifted. Her parents were intent on Diane not revealing her dyslexia for fear she would be placed in a remedial rather than a gifted program in her school. They worried about how their dyslexic daughter would be perceived: As a student requiring remedial instruction? As a student benefiting from placement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_502" title="502"/>in a gifted program? Are they mutually exclusive? This experience marks the start of an early education journey, one experienced by many dyslexic boys and girls, of contrasting, perhaps even conflicting approaches. Would her strengths be the focus, so that she was placed in a gifted program, or would the emphasis be on her weakness, so that she was placed in a remedial class? Ideally, as in the sea of strengths approach, educators would like to access her strengths and remediate her weaknesses, as is most often practiced in specialized schools for dyslexia. In Diane’s case, she did not have a choice, and she and her parents elected to keep her dyslexia hidden. The cost to Diane was feelings of loneliness and isolation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Diane reads very slowly, can’t spell, has a terrible sense of direction so that she frequently gets lost, and, as noted above, was challenged by carrying out simple addition. Her school experience reveals the mistreatment dyslexics often experience as a result of the widespread ignorance of their sea of strengths profile encompassing both strengths and weaknesses. Diane’s combination of strengths as revealed by an intelligence test and weakness as a slow reader and poor speller caused her sixth-grade teacher to interpret this as her not trying hard enough and to seek to punish her for what he perceived as misbehavior.</p>
			<p class="indent">Characteristic of the experience of many dyslexics was Diane’s admission application to the University of Michigan, which presented a seemingly contradictory portrait of low standardized test scores together with perfect grades (the result of hard work and perseverance). Although she had two legacy parents (alumni of the school), she was not accepted at first. Characteristically, she did not give up. Instead, she states, “I fought my way in,” successfully petitioning the admissions office for a second chance. As an undergraduate she came close to failing freshman English and failed her foreign-language course. Used to facing adversity, Diane persevered and was elated when she entered the world of higher-level mathematics and economics. Simple arithmetic like memorizing the times table involves storing and retrieving numbers phonologically, something quite difficult for dyslexics, but using higher-level mathematics depends on understanding and facility with complex mathematical concepts. Her brain came into its comfort zone and she felt, at last, that this was where she belonged.</p>
			<p class="indent">Life as a dyslexic is replete with contrasts between today and yesterday. Diane’s life is no exception. “Today I’m standing at the University of Michigan,” she says. “I’m about to teach two courses, and [yesterday, when I was a student,] I had to take remedial writing in my first course at the University of Michigan, and it was humiliating.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_503" title="503"/>Swonk was invited to sit on the advisory board of the business school at the University of Chicago, where she received her MBA.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					Every time I have a meeting at the University of Chicago and they show me how good the test scores are of the incoming students, I say, <i>And that means what?</i> I mean, I didn’t have those test scores and I graduated in the top of the class. Why does that matter?</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Having spent over three decades successfully navigating the economics space, she is now at the very top of her field. Yet she still struggles to find her way from the office elevator every day, and to read quickly, and she hopes that spell-check can help her distinguish between <i>from</i> and <i>form.</i> Although she is frequently asked to give talks, she is unable to read a speech. She jots down notes along with an outline but does not read from these as she speaks.</p>
			<p class="indent">Swonk grew up ashamed of her dyslexia. Then, in 2002, <i>Forbes</i> magazine included her in an article on successful dyslexics in the business world. She views this “outing” as life-changing, allowing her to embrace her dyslexia as part of who she is. She believes, “You learn because you fail a lot.”</p>
			<p class="indent">There are always going to be unexpected failures, which often result, particularly if you are dyslexic, in the development of unparalleled resilience. Diane places high value on endurance, perseverance, and flexibility. Her motto is, <i>No one succeeds alone.</i> Not surprisingly, her advice centers on people—understanding their abilities and their challenges and creating a highly effective team that works together. That’s what leadership is all about.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>As a dyslexic, I succeed by engaging in ongoing collaborative work. I depend on a diverse team whose talents complement one another. We find unique answers in our diverse decision making.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Here, I think, as a dyslexic, Diane Swonk may have intuitively hit upon the workplace model of the sea of strengths paradigm. In addition to having a diverse team, she emphasizes the importance of being fearless and not being afraid of taking risks, failing, and picking yourself up and going on.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>As a dyslexic I’ve learned that the best way to avoid risk is to identify it, and have my team think out of the box—what could go wrong, what could go right? Risk can be on both ends, right? Something really positive could happen, and on the other side something really negative.</p>
				<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_504" title="504"/>Most firms don’t want to think about the negative. They want to just kind of cruise on a trend. I think about [fellow dyslexic] Chuck Schwab, who said to me, “You didn’t think sequentially.” I don’t think linearly. I think in reaction and functions. I always tell people, <i>If you want strategic thinking, come to me. If you want linear thinking, don’t come to me.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">To Diane Swonk, the key element in her work is her team and its diversity.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>We have a team that sometimes is a little quirky, but we’re very diverse and we’re all very different, and to me, diversification of a portfolio is the best way to get rid of risk. That’s what I’m doing every time I sit down with my people and try to bring as many different views as I can to the table.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Swonk emphasizes, “You learn by doing it…. You learn by sheer endurance. You learn from your mistakes.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Swonk joins her big-picture thinking as a dyslexic with her determination to use her deep knowledge of economics to bring about positive change.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>The issue in education that I’m very involved in is human capital. Specifically, I’ve given congressional testimony on income inequalities and economic mobility. The ignorance and lack of action on dyslexia is a major reason why there isn’t economic mobility. And understanding the role dyslexia plays in this is a game-changer. Recognizing how prevalent dyslexia is and how often it goes undetected begins to reframe the debate about the causes of economic inequality and serves to shape our nation’s potential going forward. Recognizing and understanding dyslexia may be a solution to income inequalities and a solution to the lost human capital.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">To Swonk, growing up with dyslexia is a story of endurance and recognizing and finding a comfort zone. And, yes, dyslexia is lifelong—it does not go away. What does change as a life’s journey unfolds is that your strengths more and more come to the fore. Weaknesses may remain, but they are far overshadowed by the remarkable strengths that shine brightly and represent who you are.</p>

			<h3 class="head"><b>ARI EMANUEL</b></h3>
			<p>Growing up, Ari Emanuel experienced the full range of symptoms associated with being dyslexic. In elementary school, shown flash cards, he says, “I knew the word, but I couldn’t say the word, so for whatever reason my brain was identifying it but the verbal wasn’t working—the word just wouldn’t come out of my mouth.” Ari knew that there was something amiss; he just didn’t know its name, what it was.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I didn’t really know what was going on. I just knew that I couldn’t read as fast as other kids. I tried to put myself in the class where I thought that the teacher would overlook me so I wouldn’t have to read out loud. And then as I went on in school, people made fun of me. It was completely depressing.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Ari’s mother was his great champion and tried in as many ways as she could to support him.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I didn’t know what the problem was; I was just plain stupid. And she would say, “Look, you’re such a great athlete.” Then I would say, “Mommy, I’m a great athlete, but I still can’t read.”</p>
				<p class="indent">My mother would keep on reassuring me and finding ways of helping me. She would get me reading tutors. She never stopped trying to help me. She would stay up very late at night to practice reading with me, and she made me repeat my words over and over again. I hated it at the time. Today, when I think about it, I have to give my mom credit. I am grateful to her.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Other highly successful dyslexics talk about their bouts with low self-esteem and the extraordinary role their champion played. Film and television producer Brian Grazer, who is dyslexic, agrees that one of the most damaging consequences of dyslexia may be its destruction of self-esteem.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					Most or all of my best movies that I’ve produced, or television shows, all sort of revolve around <i>self-worth.</i> Whether it’s <i>Friday Night Lights</i>—they lose the game, but they become men. They become complete people. Basically, self-worth, self-esteem, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_506" title="506"/>identity, to me, are probably the foundational and most important thing of all. Dyslexia can break you down, and you can’t allow it to break you down. It is so important when you do have one person who can give you the confidence not to allow anything to break you down.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">For Emanuel, this person was his mother. For Grazer, it was his grandmother.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I had this little Jewish grandmother, Sonia. And she would always tell me that I was going to be special, that I would become somebody really meaningful. And I just didn’t get it. She’d say, “You’re going to use curiosity. You ask good questions.” And she reinforced that constantly. There was a point when I was always looking at my report cards, and I was always getting D’s or straight F’s. And I’m thinking, <i>There is literally no evidence at all that I’m going to be special.</i> My grandmother would say, “Oh, no, no. You are. You absolutely are. Continue to ask these questions. Define yourself that way.” Literally, it was my grandmother and my response to not being able to read that led me to actually refine my curiosity and ultimately use it to gain lots and lots and lots of information. I actually wrote a book titled <i>A Curious Mind.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				More recently, Grazer has written a book, <i>Face-to-Face: The Art of Human Connection</i> (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2019), where he shares a second dyslexic strength—making eye contact with another person and the incredible benefits that come with such direct communication.</p>
			<p class="indent">For Emanuel, it was not only being dyslexic but being placed in special education when he was in high school that was one of his biggest traumas. While he couldn’t read well, he excelled in mathematics and was great at sports, especially wrestling. Still, this did not stop his classmates from making fun of him and calling him all sorts of painful names: “Stupid.” “Moron.” “Idiot.” A trait still with him today is not to take abusive behavior quietly. He describes an incident in the school lunchroom:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I remember all of the kids in special ed would go to lunch together. I can remember the football team would come in there and they would start making fun of me. I just remember taking the tray and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_507" title="507"/>throwing it at that bully of a football player. And I would be in the principal’s office at the end of every day. I just remember taking the tray and I think I broke his nose with the tray.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">For Emanuel, his immediate fear and worry was, would he graduate from high school? He worried “if I was going to make it. Am I ever going to be successful? The toughest thing was being in a special education program in a really high-end [very competitive] school.” It is clear in speaking with Emanuel that his hero is his relentless advocate, unabashed supporter, and without exception champion, his mom. She never gave up, and neither did her son. As he recalls, “She put up with all my teachers telling her that I’d never graduate from high school and forget about college. My mom stuck by me, and I didn’t want to and would not disappoint her.” And he did not disappoint her. Emanuel went on to graduate from Macalester College, where he majored in economics with a double major in computer science. How the future outlook has changed for Ari Emanuel, going from a doubtful future, with teachers predicting he would not graduate from high school, to being labeled by <i>The New York Times</i> as “the prominent power player in Hollywood.”</p>

			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_508" title="508"/>He started his career as a talent agent working in television. In 1995, he and three partners founded the Endeavor Agency. In 2001, Patrick Whitesell came on board as co-CEO, and the two have since been described as “rewriting the Hollywood script.” In 2009, the Endeavor Agency merged with the long-established William Morris Agency, becoming WME. In 2013, in a bold and what many consider to be an industry-changing disruptive move, WME joined with a very different organization, IMG, the International Management Group, one focused on a very different space, that of representing sports talent and fashion models and selling media rights for major university sporting events. Emanuel believes his dyslexia played a major role in his company’s ascendancy.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Thank God I’m dyslexic. You know, when you’re dyslexic, you’ve got to work really hard. You’re okay with failure, because you feel it every day. You see things differently because you have to. You know what failing is? Not doing it. Not that I did it and failed. Failing for me is not doing it. For me, I had these ideas, I want to do it. Let’s do it. And guess what? What happens if it doesn’t work? You just have to keep on trying until it works.</p>
				<p class="indent">I spend a lot of time reading with my dyslexic sons as well. Each has something special—for example, unbelievable fortitude. You have to give them all the basics and support that will make a difference to them, tell them about how you dealt with things, and that will then lead them to have the knowledge to make good decisions and succeed.</p>
				<p class="indent">You’re in high school, and somebody says to you, <i>You’re stupid.</i> There’s nothing more embarrassing or hurtful. So now in business I am not afraid. I know I have the ability to think creatively or look around the corner and see things differently. I think it gives you the ability, one, not to be afraid of risk and failing, and two, it makes you try stuff, because you’re always trying to do stuff better and differently.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Emanuel, too, stresses the importance of surrounding yourself with a team of people whose skills you can call upon to complement your own needs. Referring once again to his dyslexic son Noah, this totally engaged dad says, “He has an incredible sense of people. The best thing, something dyslexia gives you and I see that Noah has, is empathy.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Emanuel reflects on the importance of failure, and especially a person’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_509" title="509"/>response to failure: “Well, there are many lessons, but one lesson for sure—you learn more from failing.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Such is life with dyslexia that when Emanuel was honored by the Lab School of Washington, DC, he learned that he was expected to deliver an acceptance speech. His longtime nemesis, reading aloud before an audience, was now before him as he reflected, “I’ve always had a horrible time reading aloud, and it takes me a long time to read.” As is typical of Emanuel, he overcame his fears. He read his speech and truly enjoyed the entire event.</p>
			<p class="indent">He appreciates the positive side of dyslexia, which he attributes to helping him to understand that he doesn’t know everything, which in turn has led to his “greatest asset”: being able to tap into the strengths of those around him and appreciating and utilizing these people to their best ability. His dyslexia has played a major role in building great teams. He further credits his dyslexia with making him more empathetic to those who are struggling. Recall that empathy is a strength in our Sea of Strengths model. (See Figure 12, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page_56">this page</a>.)</p>
			<p class="indent">And empathetic Ari Emanuel is. His empathy, together with his big-picture thinking, has driven him to his latest project, one that will greatly benefit the futures of disadvantaged dyslexic children living in Los Angeles. Emanuel has committed himself and taken major steps to start a specialized public charter school to serve disadvantaged boys and girls who are dyslexic. This school will be a game-changer for dyslexic children whose parents could never afford the tuition of a specialized school for dyslexia. With Louisiana Key Academy as a model of a successful and highly effective specialized public charter school for dyslexia, together with Dr. Laura Cassidy and Dr. Bennett Shaywitz, I am thrilled to be part of Ari’s creative and much-needed newest project.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PHYSICIAN: CARDIAC SURGEON</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DELOS M. COSGROVE</b></h3>
			<p>Dr. Delos (Toby) Cosgrove, who was CEO and president of the Cleveland Clinic from 2004 to 2018, is dyslexic. He is renowned in the field of heart valve repair, where he has worked tirelessly to make cardiac procedures safer and more effective. Known for his innovation and creativity, he has thirty patents for cardiac procedures that have helped to solve many problems encountered in valvular surgery.</p>
			<p class="indent">Cosgrove’s dyslexia caused him to struggle to learn to read throughout his early schooling. In college, his foreign-language class was “almost the end of me as I worked my butt off to obtain three D minuses and a D in remedial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_510" title="510"/>French.” Reading, writing a paper, or giving a talk remained “big problems.” For young Toby, college meant nonstop work. “All I did was study, even on weekends. While everyone else was partying or going to the movies or sports events, I packed my suitcase and headed off home to Albany, where I studied all weekend. And because I had to work so hard, I earned the nickname Turkey Toby.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Reflecting his reading difficulties, standardized testing, including the SAT and the MCAT, was a disaster for him. As a result of his poor college grades and low MCAT scores, it seemed doubtful that Cosgrove would ever fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor. In fact, he was accepted at only one of the thirteen medical schools to which he applied. The University of Virginia Medical School was eager to admit students from his college, Williams, and so his admission was expedited. As a medical student, Cosgrove received “the first A of my life,” in surgery. He was already a physician and completing his surgical residency when he was drafted into the air force. Between 1968 and 1969 he served as chief of the United States Air Force Casualty Staging Flight at Da Nang, Vietnam, and was awarded the Bronze Star. Following his military service, he was accepted into a residency in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, the same residency program that Graeme Hammond (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c34_r1.xhtml#page_512">this page</a>) had completed several years earlier.</p>
			<p class="indent">Just about all of the many dyslexic physicians I have come to know agree with Dr. Cosgrove’s conclusion that “the hard part with dyslexia is getting through the academics. It’s not about practicing medicine.” Since the first edition of this book, I have come to know Dr. Cosgrove on a personal level, and my admiration has grown still more.</p>
			<figure class="figure figure_medium_caption">

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_511" title="511"/>In addition to his prominence as a superb surgeon, Cosgrove is an extraordinary, fearless innovator, with accomplishments including creating the very first Global Center for Health Innovation; developing the Cleveland Clinic’s Outcomes Book, which measures, details, and makes public outcomes of a range of services; partnering with Case Western Reserve University to start the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, the very first tuition-free medical school in the nation; and, of great benefit to patients, and conforming to the Cosgrove Cleveland Clinic motto, “Patients First,” establishing the rare policy of promising patients who call the health system the opportunity to see a physician that very day. The Cleveland Clinic is ranked number two overall nationally by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report,</i> and its heart program is ranked number one. Cosgrove is always seeking new and better ways to improve patients’ lives and their experience at the clinic. He is an engaged leader who truly cares deeply about people. Cosgrove has received many honors, including election to the prestigious National Academy of Medicine.</p>
			<p class="indent">Yet Dr. Cosgrove continued to experience reminders of his dyslexia while practicing medicine. These reminders did not come when he was in the midst of his professional surgical work but emerged during the side times:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Four or five times each day, I would completely stop a patient’s heart from beating for one to two hours, perform some type of surgical intervention, and attempt to restart the heart. In each case, there is a moment of tension while I wait to see if the heart will start beating. As tense as this is, I know I am in control and can deal with any contingency that may arise.</p>
				<p class="indent">After the surgery is completed, it’s a different matter. I pick up the telephone to call the patient’s family waiting in the lounge and the nurses break into hysterics as they hear me trying, but unable, to pronounce the patient’s family name. I just can’t pronounce those silly words.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Of course, family names are the equivalent of nonsense words, and chances are that a dyslexic has not previously encountered many of the names. As a result, he has not memorized their pronunciation and is unable to pronounce the names correctly.</p>
			<p class="indent">In September 1996, Cosgrove was invited to give the Williams College convocation address to inaugurate the senior year for the class of ’97. He <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_512" title="512"/>chose to speak on “Failure” because “this is a topic with which I am very familiar.” He addressed the students and their families:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>My career at Williams was anything but distinguished. Diligent study produced a collection of C’s…. No honor societies or distinguished offices graced my curriculum vitae. Twelve of thirteen medical schools rejected me. During my residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, I was informed that I was the least talented individual in my residency group and advised not to go into cardiothoracic surgery.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Cosgrove sees failure as the starting point for a process of learning and discovery. He states that he’s failed so often he has lost his fear of it. Cosgrove credits his dyslexia with “teaching me to work like crazy.” And so even after being rejected by twelve of thirteen medical schools and being told that he was the worst resident in his class at Massachusetts General Hospital and strongly advised not to go into cardiothoracic surgery, he did not give up, nor did he lose sight of his dream. His extraordinary accomplishments, both as a groundbreaking cardiothoracic surgeon and as an unparalleled leader and patient advocate at the Cleveland Clinic, speak to his wisdom of continuing forward and realizing his dream. Dr. Cosgrove’s story is a powerful reminder that perhaps we need to rethink how we judge people and determine who has the potential to be a future leader and make a major contribution to society.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>GRAEME HAMMOND</b></h3>
			<p>The late Graeme Hammond spent his professional career as one of an elite group of surgeons actively engaged in cutting-edge research while maintaining a busy operating schedule. His difficulties in reading were obvious in grade school. His parents took him to the ultimate diagnostician of his time, Dr. Sam Orton, who confirmed that the young boy was dyslexic. He began reading lessons, but they were provided haphazardly and were not terribly effective. It would be years before he was able to read his first book.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I applied to medical school because I didn’t need any foreign languages for medical school,” he said, “and I knew I could handle the science.” As he progressed, learning medicine in depth, medical school got “better and better every year. Finally, in my last year, I was one of the top ten students of my class.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_513" title="513"/>Following graduation, he was accepted for a surgical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital and then for a faculty position at Yale. Hammond, as judged by his mentors—senior surgeons at both Harvard and Yale—had what it takes to be a top-tier surgeon. However, while he could exercise superior judgment, operate with a sure hand, and in every way more than meet the day-to-day demands of surgery, passing the National Board of Medical Examiners Licensing Examinations was another matter. To him, this seemed more about test-taking skills than about knowledge, but these tests almost curtailed his career:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>When I was a fourth-year medical student I absolutely could not pass the national boards. I still have not passed them. And so I came through an alternate route, the state boards, which consisted of questions to be answered in essay form, not multiple-choice. I have no problem with these, and so I took the New York State boards and sailed through them. And when I was a resident at Mass General, the Massachusetts boards accepted the New York State boards. They never knew I hadn’t passed my national boards. Subsequently I was on the National Board of Medical Examiners and have a diploma hanging on my wall from them thanking me for being on their board for so long. But ironically, I never passed their boards.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">As much as dyslexia had frustrated him, he believed that dyslexia was responsible for the qualities that ultimately led to his success.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>For me it’s been a blessing in disguise. This difficulty reading gave me a tremendous amount of perseverance. My whole life is about striving, because I’ve had so many roadblocks put in my way. I see a lot of surgeons who do everything well, yet they never, ever question. They’ve never been forced to try another way to find an answer to a problem. In my own case, I had developed the ability to look for other ways of doing things.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Hammond and Cosgrove follow in the footsteps of many renowned physicians, past and current, who are dyslexic, including Harvey Cushing, who founded modern neurosurgery and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Sir William Osler. The numerous contemporary physicians who are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_514" title="514"/>dyslexic include Beryl Benacerraf, professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School, an international authority on prenatal ultrasonography; Tyler Lucas, chief of orthopedic surgery at Metropolitan Hospital in New York City; Karen Santucci, professor of pediatrics at Yale School of Medicine and chief, Pediatric Emergency Department; and Stuart Yudofsky, distinguished professor emeritus and former chairman, Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>SCIENTIST</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>GEORGE CHURCH</b></h3>
			<p><span id="ftn-218"/>Ask anyone knowledgeable about groundbreaking science whom they most admire for his or her discoveries, insights, and brilliance, and George Church, often referred to as “biotech’s genetic prophet,” is consistently near or at the top of that list. He is the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and a professor of health sciences and technology at Harvard and MIT, as well as a founding member of Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard.</p>
			<p class="indent">When, early on, Church struggled to decipher printed words on the page, he turned to picture books. He had no difficulty interpreting the stories the pictures represented. “If an assignment required a non–picture book, then I would find a picture book that I thought equivalent to it.” The picture books were part of a Time-Life series that Church’s mother was using to help him compensate for his inability to read words by making sure he had “really interesting” books. Church avidly took to these books, memorizing the twenty volumes so that he could tell you what picture was on each page and what it was about. From Church’s perspective, even more than reading difficulty, “I had a worse problem—I was shy.”</p>
			<p class="indent">His caring mom, aware that her son was very bright, tried to unearth the cause of his reading difficulties and periodically had him tested, which eventually led to a diagnosis of dyslexia. Church’s early school experiences were a series of ups and downs. As he describes it, “I also managed to repeat ninth grade and flunk out of Duke in 1976.” One reason for his leaving the Duke graduate program was that he was so deeply consumed by his groundbreaking research using X-ray crystallography to study the three-dimensional structure of transfer RNA that he often spent hundreds of hours in the lab <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_515" title="515"/>each week, resulting in his neglecting his classes. <span id="ftn-219"/>As a consequence, he was “withdrawn” from the degree program in January 1976 and presciently told that “whatever problems…contributed to your lack of success…at Duke will not keep you from a successful pursuit of a productive career.” And right they were, with several groundbreaking publications emerging from his graduate work at Duke.</p>
			<p class="indent">Harvard, wisely seeing past his forced withdrawal from Duke, then accepted Church, and the rest is history. One does not often hear about a scientist anywhere in the world whose mere mention brings out “amazing,” “extraordinary,” and “genius.” Perhaps we should now also knowingly add “dyslexic.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The experience of being asked to leave Duke and then, at age twenty-five, being accepted to a wonderful lab under the direction of Nobel laureate Walter Gilbert at Harvard was like being given a second chance with a breath of invigorating fresh air. As Church describes it, “I had to restart graduate school, and I guess I felt I had a chance to reinvent myself and try much harder to conquer my shyness by being more sociable, and I spent more time reading.” As often happens when a dyslexic is interested in a specific topic, he will be drawn to reading more and more about it, and his reading will gradually improve.

I spend a lot of time on the figures, still. While they might spend a lot more time, you know, with the words and not the figures. I read incredibly slowly. Because I wasn’t trying to read it the way others were trying to read it, I actually got decent comprehension out of it.

			<p class="indent">Church is pleased that bright, successful dyslexics like himself are often cited. At the same time he is concerned that those dyslexics who are not identified during the school years and therefore receive no intervention and no accommodations are far too often ignored. “I think the amount of waste must be enormous,” he says.</p>

				<p>All the time, all the time. I think that I am uncharacteristically less involved in grant paper writing then most professors are. I realize that I have those things where I can contribute.

			<p class="indent">Here we have a special moment that should not be overlooked. In dyslexia, you may not be perfect, with a number of things you do not do well—and yet even with these imperfections, if you are bright, dedicated, and work very hard, you can succeed at a very high level and make a real difference, a major contribution to society.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another dyslexic scientist who made major contributions to society is the aforementioned molecular biologist Carol Greider, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009 for her discovery of telomerase, which plays an important role in age-related diseases. As you read this, keep in mind her earlier experiences: “I had a lot of trouble in school and was put into remedial classes. I thought I was stupid.” This pattern for dyslexic scientists seems to repeat itself. Jacques Dubochet, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017 for his work on cryoelectron microscopy, did poorly in school and describes himself as the “first official dyslexic” in the town in Switzerland where he lived. <span id="ftn-220"/>That same year, another dyslexic, Richard H. Thaler, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. In awarding the prize, the Nobel jury said, <span id="ftn-221"/>“He’s made economics more human,” identifying a common denominator of dyslexia.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WRITER</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>JOHN IRVING</b></h3>
			<p>
				When John Irving was a student at Phillips Exeter Academy, a New England prep school, he demonstrated glimmers of talent only to those few who were able to appreciate it. He was a C– student in English, with an SAT verbal score of 475. Later, of course, he became the best-selling author of <i>The World According to Garp</i> and <i>The Cider House Rules</i> and an Academy Award–winning screenwriter. As Irving tells it:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_517" title="517"/>I simply accepted the conventional wisdom of the day—I was a struggling student; therefore, I was stupid.</p>
				<p class="indent">I needed five years to pass the three-year foreign-language requirement…. I passed Latin I with a D, and flunked Latin II; then I switched to Spanish, which I barely survived….</p>
				<p class="indent">It wasn’t until my younger son, Brendan, was diagnosed as slightly dyslexic that I realized how I had been given the shaft. His teachers said that Brendan comprehended everything he read but that he didn’t comprehend a text as quickly as his peers; they said that he could express himself as well as, or actually better than, his peers but that it took him longer to organize his thoughts on paper. This sounded familiar to me. As a child, Brendan read with his finger following the sentence—as I read, as I <i>still</i> read. Unless I’ve written it, I read whatever “it” is very slowly—and with my finger.</p>
				<p class="indent">I wasn’t diagnosed as dyslexic at Exeter; I was seen as just plain stupid. I failed a spelling test and was put in a remedial spelling class. Because I couldn’t learn how to spell—I still can’t spell!—I was advised to see the school <i>psychiatrist</i>! This advice made no sense to me then—it makes no sense to me now—but if you were a poor student at Exeter, you would develop such a lasting sense of your own inferiority that you’d probably be in need of a psychiatrist one day.</p>
				<p class="indent">I wish I’d known, when I was a student at Exeter, that there was a word for what made being a student so hard for me; I wish I could have said to my friends that I was dyslexic. Instead I kept quiet, or—to my closest friends—I made bad jokes about how stupid I was. Brendan knows he’s not stupid; he knows he’s the same kind of student I was.</p>
				<p class="indent">My only anger was at people who presumed that I was lazy, because I was working harder than anybody else. I had at least one teacher each year who thought that there was nothing the matter with me except that I was lazy.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">It was not academics but athletics—wrestling—that was Irving’s salvation. Whatever satisfaction he was not receiving in the classroom, he was achieving on the wrestling mat.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_518" title="518"/>My wrestling coach, Ted Seabrooke, kept me in school; he gave me enough confidence in myself, through wrestling, that I was able to take a daily beating in my classes and keep coming back for more. An ironic blessing of my having to repeat my senior year at Exeter was that I finally got to be captain of the wrestling team—my sole distinction, my only honor, in five years at the academy.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">How has dyslexia influenced his writing?</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>It’s become an advantage. In writing a novel, it doesn’t hurt anybody to have to go slowly…. One reason I have confidence in writing the kind of novels I write is that I have confidence in my stamina to go over something again and again no matter how difficult it is—whether it is for the fourth or fifth or eighth time. It’s an ability to push myself and not to be lazy. This is something I would ascribe to the difficulties I had to overcome at an early age.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">How does Irving, a poor reader, read the voluminous number of pages he produces?</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I read slowly and I reread a lot. I read a paragraph, and if I’m not 100 percent concentrating on what I’m reading or if I’m the slightest bit tired, I have a problem. And from that, too, I have learned that if you have to concentrate twice as hard as somebody else, you get twice as tired, twice as soon. And so when I am a little bit tired, the difference is enormous.</p>
				<p class="indent">I also had to practice. I am actually a very good reader of my own work. But I think that comes from my practice of reading my work aloud and understanding the cadence with which it’s written. I read my own work aloud as I write it or I say it aloud as I write it. And in fact, when I am writing in my office at home, people walking by always think I’m on the phone.</p>
				<p class="indent">I also use my finger, as I did when I was a student. Especially when I’m tired or when the print is a little too small, I just keep my finger on it. And when I do public readings, I never take my finger off where I am.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">One could not ask for a more classic description of how a very bright person who is dyslexic reads or of the usefulness of reading aloud. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_519" title="519"/>Time impacted Irving’s studies and also his performance on standardized tests:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>The colleges that admitted me out of Exeter all cited my writing sample and a couple of recommendations from teachers who said decent things about my capacity to write. I certainly would have had nowhere to go if I had only been judged on my standardized test scores.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Life was better for Irving as his education progressed. Graduate school was the best, for it was more specialized.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>When I got to graduate school at Iowa in creative writing I was taking one literature course. I could concentrate on one thing for three or four or five hours instead of doing something for an hour and putting it aside and doing something that was completely different for an hour.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Irving’s problems with rote memory do not reflect a general memory problem. He has a “wonderful” memory when it comes to remembering the most complex information—as long as it has a meaningful connection. While he cannot remember telephone numbers (which are random numbers), he can recall the most arcane bits and pieces of his novel because they are part of a network of information that forms a meaningful whole. “My interpretation of myself when I was in my late teens was that I had a lousy memory,” he says. “I’ve since discovered that I have a very good memory, because I would say that to write a long, complicated, plot-driven novel, you need to have a wonderful memory.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Irving has ridden the roller coaster of life that you experience as a dyslexic and has been deeply affected by the experience. As a parent, he is also extremely sensitive to the needs of children who are dyslexic. His advice to parents:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I think the burden on parents and on teachers, when they see that the task of reading is a challenge, is to find ways to reward the child constantly. And you have to not lower your expectations for that child. You have to keep up your belief in the child and maintain your vision of his future.</p>
				<p class="indent">I had difficulty in school. But I had around me my parents and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_520" title="520"/>my coach to give me support and to recognize that I needed to have more and more confidence in myself because I wasn’t getting it from school. And so the harder you have to work at anything, the more important it is that you have somebody telling you you’re doing a good job. You need somebody who is giving you a lot of encouragement, a lot of support; someone who knows how hard you’re working.</p>
				<p class="indent">Actually, having to go through something that’s a struggle, even at a young age, can be a very positive experience for you—if you’re being supported and constantly told that you’re doing a good job. I am a believer in telling kids that they’re great kids, that you know how hard they’re working—you can’t overdo that. And, finally, you have to help the child imagine that he can be a success and to sustain that vision of himself. My very first wrestling coach used to say that before you could beat someone better than you, you had to be able to imagine that you could be a winner. You had to believe that you could do it. It sounds like coach-speak on the one hand, but on the other hand, it’s very true.</p>

			<h3 class="head"><b>STEPHEN J. CANNELL</b></h3>
			<p>
				Stephen Cannell, Emmy Award–winning television writer of such hits as <i>The Rockford Files</i> and <i>The A-Team,</i> producer, best-selling author, and actor, was dyslexic. For him, too, school was a nightmare. Especially traumatic to Cannell were the terrible misjudgments of his abilities, particularly his potential as a writer. “I was not very good in writing because one of the things they stressed at private schools was spelling. If I couldn’t spell, that meant to them that I couldn’t write.” Just as an inability to spell some words impacted John Irving, misspellings also constricted Cannell’s writing. He recalled that “even the words I thought I could spell I couldn’t spell. By the time I got to college I would only use the words I could spell, so I wouldn’t use all the words in my vocabulary. That limited my ability to write a good essay.”</p>
			<p class="indent">It was a college instructor, Ralph Salisbury, who finally saw the talent that had remained hidden in Stephen throughout his previous twelve or so years of schooling. A grateful Cannell described what this teacher meant to him: “Ralph was the first instructor I ever had in my entire academic career who said to me, ‘It isn’t important to me whether you can’t spell. I’m interested in your ideas. I’m a creative-writing instructor, not a spelling teacher.’ ”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_521" title="521"/>Cannell’s urgent message—people need to understand what Salisbury clearly understood—was that writing and spelling are not related, and also that writing and dyslexia are not related. He posed a rhetorical question: “How is it to be dyslexic and write? Well, it’s easy. People say, you must have climbed this horrible mountain to be able to write with this condition. Writing has nothing to do with dyslexia. Spelling has something to do with it.” He was often asked how someone who is dyslexic can choose writing as his career. “We [dyslexics] are very good with abstract thought. And that’s the key in writing,” he said. You could feel the excitement as he described how his outline, what he referred to as “the cerebral part,” allowed “the more visceral part” of his writing to come out:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Everything I write I see; it’s really a written picture. It’s like I’m in the scene with the characters. I see it like it was a movie. And I often will describe it the way my imagination is picking it up. For dialogue, I’m everyone in the scene, and I say my lines of dialogue. And so my outline gives structure, it frees me to be all these people, to have a party with my characters.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">For Cannell it was the image that drove the writing. He could use words to paint the picture that he saw in his imagination. Words were the servants of the visual images; they were the tools but not the creators of the images that he wrote about.</p>
			<p class="indent">His dyslexia did not prevent Cannell from being a prolific and highly regarded writer, scripting more than 450 episodes of the nearly forty television series he created or cocreated. In addition he published at least eighteen novels. I was surprised and extremely touched that in his novel <i>At First Sight,</i> Cannell chose to write these words:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>There was important research on dyslexia being conducted at Yale by Drs. Bennett and Sally Shaywitz using fMRIs to determine what part of the brain was activated when reading. Chandler had been excited with Sally and Bennett’s work and had invested foundation money to support their research.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Stephen Cannell was a friend, and it saddens me to report that he died in September 2010.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other dyslexic writers include Max Brooks, Octavia Butler, John Cheever, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_522" title="522"/>Fanny Flagg, Richard Ford, John Grisham, and the children’s book authors Dav Pilkney, Avi, and Patricia Polacco.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p>After reading these stories, no one should ever doubt “a person like that” can be a winner in any field in which he or she has an interest and talent. These are stories of triumph over innate difficulties as well as those created by misunderstandings, misjudgments, and stereotyped views of what constitutes real ability or talent. For these dyslexics and thousands of others, the obstacle to success is often not their inherent physiologic weakness but the misguided perceptions of others—those who believe that spelling has something to do with creative writing, that slow reading is incompatible with sharp thinking, that scores on standardized tests predict performance in real life for dyslexics. Each of these remarkably talented individuals almost didn’t realize his or her life’s goals. Each was made to feel stupid or incapable. So-called experts erected barriers and gave bad advice. And yet each ultimately triumphed, viewing dyslexia as a gift more than a burden. As Sir Richard Branson often says, “If I hadn’t been dyslexic, I would never have done it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Dyslexics think differently. They are intuitive and excel at problem-solving, seeing the big picture, and simplifying. They feast on visualizing, abstract thinking, and thinking out of the box. They are poor rote reciters but inspired visionaries. Adult dyslexics are tough—having struggled, they are used to adversity; hard work and perseverance come naturally. Having experienced failure, they are fearless, undaunted by setbacks. Repetition and practice are a way of life. Each was rescued by a special person—a parent, a grandparent, a teacher—who saw the raw talent and nurtured it in the midst of all the naysayers. Hope was sustained by a taste of success in sports or some other activity. Yes, the symptoms of dyslexia persist, but they needn’t interfere with success.</p>
			<p class="indent">Success is waiting for your child, and now you know what to do to help her achieve it. You don’t have to rely on chance. You know how to identify a problem early and how to get the right help to ensure that it is your child’s strengths and not the misperceptions of others that ultimately define her. You know what is possible and how to nourish it. Children blossom with reward and praise, flourish because of high expectations. Above all, you must maintain your belief in your child, provide unconditional support for her, and hold true to a bright vision of her future. The rewards will be great.</p>
			<p class="indent">Today all dyslexic children should know that they can succeed. Dyslexia can be overcome.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_523" title="523"/>A final word: I often compare dyslexia to an iceberg that is 90 percent hidden underwater, as shown in Figure 54. We see many of the successful individuals you have just read about—Emanuel, Boies, Swonk, Cosgrove, and Schwab—visible, standing atop the iceberg. What we must not forget about are the 90 percent of dyslexics who are underwater and unseen, literally millions of dyslexic boys and girls who one might say are drowning, struggling, not knowing that they have dyslexia and that they are smart. It is this hidden 90 percent that I worry about so much. It is these invisible dyslexic boys and girls who are currently ignored by their schools, losing self-esteem, often becoming anxious, fearing the future and far too often dropping out of school. It does not have to be this way. We know better and must do better. We have the knowledge. We must act. We must ensure that schools screen for and identify dyslexia and provide evidence-based effective interventions that will give these currently hidden children a chance at the American dream. Our dyslexic children and our country demand nothing less.</p>
