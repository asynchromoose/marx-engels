			<p>Prospective readers must master the alphabetic principle in order to learn to read, yet as many as one in five children are unable to do so. Why should developing an awareness that spoken words are made of smaller segments—phonemes—present such a formidable challenge? The answer lies, surprisingly, in the very same mechanism that makes speaking so easy.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-31"/>As linguists Noah Chomsky and Steven Pinker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have convincingly argued, spoken language is innate.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c05-ftn-1" id="c05-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> It is instinctive. Language does not have to be taught—all that is necessary is for humans to be exposed to their mother tongue. Through neural circuitry deep within our brains, a specialized phonological module <i>automatically</i> assembles the phonemes into words for the speaker and disassembles the spoken word back into its underlying phonemes for the listener. Thus spoken language, which takes place at a preconscious level, is effortless.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some linguists, like Pinker, argue that language can be traced back as many as one million years. <span id="ftn-32"/>John DeFrancis, professor emeritus of Chinese at the University of Hawaii, suggests that speech emerged some fifty thousand <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46" title="46"/>years ago as the dominant mode of communication among <i>Homo sapiens.</i> Every human society has a spoken language, and man is the only species that communicates by speaking (although many other species communicate using a variety of signals—grunts, screeches, electric shocks, odors, whistles, and calls). If a baby is neurologically healthy, there is almost no way she can avoid learning to speak.</p>
			<p class="indent">Language is open-ended. It is generative. Using phonemes we can create an indefinite number of words, and with these words an infinite number of ideas. We can tell jokes, we can muse, we can tell a story, we can imagine, we can describe. We can speak in the present or reflect wistfully about the past or project hopefully into the future.</p>
			<p class="indent">In contrast, animal communication systems are closed and the signals fixed. They are holistic; they do not come apart and cannot be added to or rearranged to form a new message. With animals there are a limited number of signals, and each signal is yoked to a specific meaning. There is no possibility for novelty or for infinite variation.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE PARTICULATE PRINCIPLE</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-33"/>In 1989, linguist William Abler offered a brilliant insight into the language system—what he called the particulate principle of self-diversifying systems. Although this sounds like jargon, the principle itself is elegant in its simplicity. Using biological inheritance as a model, Abler suggested that chemical compounds and human language adhere to the same principles as do combinations of DNA in forming a seemingly endless number of proteins. He reasoned that these natural processes share two basic features. Each has as its core element a “particle,” and each is characterized by a hierarchical structure. The particles serve as the building blocks that give rise to open-ended hierarchical systems. For chemicals, it is atoms; for genetics, it is the nucleotides in DNA; and for language, it is the phonemes. At the next level of the hierarchy, the particles are now larger: Atoms combine to form molecules, nucleotides join to form proteins, and phonemes come together to form words.</p>
			<p class="indent">By using a small number of phonemes, a speaker has the ability to create a seemingly infinite number of words and then sentences and paragraphs. To appreciate the vast number of combinations possible, consider that Shakespeare used 29,066 different words in his complete works (884,647 words in total).</p>

					<p class="figcaption_para" id="fig-7"><i>Figure 7. The Advantage of Particles Not Blending</i></p>
					<p class="figcaption_para1">When elements blend as they combine, as in the two circles shown, the result is a mixture of the two, something in between. In contrast, when two phonemes (particles) combine, as shown here with the two geometric shapes, they do not blend. Instead they combine to form something entirely new. Endless combinations are possible, which can produce an endless number of words.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">What allows the particulate principle to operate so effectively is the special nature of the particles. Whether they are atoms of sodium, strands (nucleotides) of DNA, or phonemes, they don’t change; they maintain their original identity. This means that they are able to combine with each other to form entirely new and larger units, be they compounds, proteins, or words—and yet the particles themselves are not changed in the process. (The advantage of <i>particles</i> over elements that do not retain their identity is shown in Figure 7. If two elements combine and blend together, the result is a mixture—somewhere in between the original two; however, when two particles combine while still maintaining their original properties, the new item formed is unique.) Forming words by combining—but not blending—phonemes brings with it the extraordinary potential to form an infinite number of words, limited only by the number of combinations. As phonemes combine to form words and words join together to form phrases and sentences, at each succeeding level of the hierarchy a larger and an entirely novel structure is created.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-34"/>A speaker can generate phonemes very quickly, with rates averaging ten to fifteen phonemes per second. In fact the pace outstrips the capacity of the listener’s acoustic machinery, which cannot pick up or process a series of incoming sounds that quickly. On the other hand, if the speaker uttered each phoneme very slowly, spoken language would be interminable. A further <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" title="48"/>complication is that the listener has to receive the phonemes at a sufficiently fast pace so that several can be held in short-term memory at the same time and integrated to form the intended words and phrases. Phonemes can be held in the temporary memory storage bin for only one or two seconds, or about five to seven unrelated words, before each, like a bubble, vanishes.</p>

					<p class="figcaption_para" id="fig-8"><i>Figure 8. Coarticulation: Overlapping Several Phonemes into One Burst of Sound</i></p>
					<p class="figcaption_para1">To say a word, a speaker first retrieves each phoneme and then coarticulates or overlaps one over the other. As shown in this illustration, the three phonemes forming the word <i>cat</i> are overlapped into one packet of sound.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Evolution has solved this problem through coarticulation: the ability to overlap several phonemes—while maintaining the integrity of each—into one bubble of sound (Figure 8). As a result of coarticulation, bursts of sounds come at a pace compatible with the auditory system’s capacity to process them, and the phonemes arrive at a rapid enough pace to meet the constraints of the short-term memory system.</p>
			<p class="indent">Critical to the entire process is the fundamental difference between sounds—the sounds of language and the sounds of noise—and the innate ability of the phonologic module to distinguish speech from nonspeech sounds. Phonemes are presented to the sense organ, the ear and its receptors, disguised in their outer packaging as an ordinary burst of sound. For example, if I were to say the word <i>cat,</i> this would appear on an oscilloscope as one pulse of sound—and that is what it is to the listener’s ear. However, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49" title="49"/>camouflaged within the packet of sound are three pieces of language: the phonemes, <i>k, aah,</i> and <i>t</i>. Once the sound is safely past the hearing machinery, the language system takes over, immediately recognizing the three phonemes as particles of language and processing them accordingly. Here the language system is different from other systems, like vision and hearing. The eye receives visual stimuli and the ear acoustic stimuli, but the ear is only a way station for language. Nature has provided a mechanism to allow sound, like a barge towing a valuable cargo, to guide the phonetic particles past the ear and into the safe haven of cerebral neural circuits specialized for receiving language. When the ear receives the parcel of sound, the specialized phonologic module in the brain immediately activates and recovers the phonemes contained within each pulse of sound, automatically translating the sound into particles of language. The listener receives the exact message sent by the speaker.</p>
			<p class="indent">What makes human speech possible as a means of communication is the coarticulation referred to earlier. In producing a word, the human speech apparatus—the larynx, palate, tongue, and lips—automatically coarticulates, that is, compresses and merges the phonemes together. As a result of coarticulation, several phonemes are folded into a single pulse or bubble of sound, without any overt clue to the underlying segmental nature of speech. Consequently, spoken language appears to be <i>seamless.</i> It is as if coarticulation has lacquered over any fissures or gaps between the individual phonemes so that what is presented to the listener is a smooth, seamless stream of speech.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>READING IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN SPEAKING</b></h2>
			<p>
				The effortless and seamless nature of spoken language has everything to do with why reading is so hard for dyslexic children. Although speaking and reading both rely on the same particle, the phoneme, there is a fundamental difference: <i>Speaking is natural and reading is not.</i> Herein lies the difficulty. Reading is an acquired act, an invention that must be learned at a conscious level. It is the very naturalness of speaking that makes reading so hard.</p>
			<p class="indent">Just as our lungs breathe in and out for us and the chambers of our hearts contract rhythmically, highly refined neural circuitry within our brains allows us to speak and to listen without conscious thought or effort. For spoken language the phoneme comes all ready to go. This is the gift that evolution has delivered to humans. Not so for reading. While reading, too, relies on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50" title="50"/>the phonologic code, the key to unraveling it is not so readily apparent and can be accessed only with effort on the part of the beginning reader.</p>
			<p class="indent">Profound differences distinguish reading from speaking. Not only are reading and writing relatively recent human accomplishments (man has had a written language for only about five thousand years), reading is still relatively rare in the world. Reading is not built into our genes; there is no reading module wired into the human brain. In order to read, we have to take advantage of what nature has provided: a biological module for language. For the object of the reader’s attention (print) to gain entry into the language module, a truly extraordinary transformation must occur. The reader must somehow convert the print on a page into a linguistic code—the phonetic code, the only code recognized and accepted by the language system. However, unlike the particles of spoken language, the letters of the alphabet have no inherent linguistic connotation. Unless the reader-to-be can convert the printed characters on the page into the phonetic code, these letters remain just a bunch of lines and circles totally devoid of linguistic meaning. This essential distinction between written and spoken language was best captured by linguist Leonard Bloomfield: <span id="ftn-35"/>“Writing is not language, but merely a way of recording language by visible marks.” The written symbols have no meaning of their own but rather stand as surrogates for speech, or, to be more exact, for the sounds of speech.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beginning readers throughout the world must learn how to decipher print—how to convert an array of meaningless symbols on paper so that they are accepted by a powerful language machinery that recognizes only the phonetic code. I remember observing a visiting student as she tried to use her euros to obtain a Coke from a vending machine at Yale. Although she literally had a pocketful of euros, her currency was essentially worthless in a machine that accepted only American coins. So it is with reading. The most eloquent of written prose is rendered meaningless if it cannot be transformed into the phonetic code recognized by that reader’s language module.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>BREAKING THE CODE</b></h2>
			<p>
				The very first discovery a child makes on his way to reading is the realization that spoken words have parts. <span id="ftn-36"/>Suddenly the child appreciates that the word he hears comes apart into smaller pieces of sound; he has developed <i>phonemic awareness.</i> It’s a remarkable discovery. There is little reason for a child <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51" title="51"/>to notice this. Since spoken language is built into our genes and takes place automatically, its segmental nature is not part of our consciousness. Furthermore, as a result of coarticulation, spoken language is seamless, further obscuring its underlying segmental nature. But once a child becomes aware of the segmental nature of spoken language, he has the basic elements—the particles of spoken language, phonemes, and their sounds—to which he can now attach the appropriate written letters. Letters linked to phonemes are no longer meaningless marks on paper but have been transformed into something truly spectacular: language. Translated into the phonetic code, printed words are now accepted by the neural circuitry already in place for processing spoken language. Decoded into phonemes, words are processed automatically by the language system. The reading code is deciphered.</p>
			<p class="indent">Seventy to 80 percent of American children learn how to transform printed symbols into a phonetic code without much difficulty. For the remainder, however, written symbols remain a mystery. These children are dyslexic. They, like Alex, cannot readily convert the alphabetic characters into a linguistic code.</p>
			<p class="indent">Typically, a young child develops phonemic awareness if he is to become a reader. That is to say, he must understand that spoken words are made up of smaller units of speech sounds: phonemes. And it is these very same phonemes to which the letters of the alphabet must attach if the written word is to be brought into the language system. All readers—dyslexic readers included—must take the same steps. The difference is simply in the effort involved and the time it takes to master the alphabetic principle.</p>
			<p class="indent">Children vary greatly in their ease of developing phonemic awareness. For some children the process is speedy and apparently effortless; exactly how these children develop phonemic awareness is currently not known. Exposure to a rich language environment, one in which children are given lots of opportunity to hear and to play with spoken words—for example, to hear rhymes and to practice rhyming songs—surely facilitates this awareness.</p>
			<p class="indent">In dyslexic children a glitch within the language system, at the level of the phonological module, impairs the child’s phonemic awareness and therefore his ability to segment the spoken word into its underlying sounds. As a result of this deficit, children have difficulty breaking the reading code.</p>
			<p class="indent">The reading process consists of two major components: decoding, which results in word identification, and comprehension (Figure 9a). When, as in Figure 9b, we consider the language module and the components of reading side by side, it becomes clear how a bright child like Alex could have trouble <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52" title="52"/>reading single words and yet comprehend what he is reading at a much higher level.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">A phonologic weakness at the lowest level of the language system impairs decoding. At the same time, all the cognitive equipment, the higher-order intellectual abilities necessary for comprehension—vocabulary, syntax, discourse (understanding connected text), and reasoning—are intact. All the equipment Gregory or Alex or other dyslexics require for understanding, for forming concepts, for comprehending the written text, is there, unaffected by the phonologic deficit. The richness and depth of their intellectual abilities explain why identification is so often delayed in bright dyslexic children. As one of my patients’ third-grade teacher remarked, “Madison is so smart; she knows the answers to the most difficult questions. She is the first one in our class to catch on to the most abstract concepts. I could never imagine that she had any problem at all.” Luckily, we can now effectively treat phonologic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53" title="53"/>deficits, while, ironically, the complex reasoning and sophisticated thinking skills that dyslexic children often possess are almost impossible to teach. My husband, the Charles and Helen Schwab Professor in Dyslexia at Yale, theorizes that since the basic circuitry for linking letters to sounds is disrupted in dyslexic readers, they develop and come to rely on other neural systems, not only for reading but for problem-solving as well. Such individuals may see things in a different, perhaps more creative way and are able to think out of the box. (Later you will meet some of these people.)</p>

				<figcaption class="figcaption dynamic_box">
					<p class="figcaption_para" id="fig-10"><i>Figure 10. Going from Text to Meaning</i></p>
					<p class="figcaption_para1">A phonological weakness blocks decoding, which in turn interferes with word identification. This prevents a dyslexic reader from applying his higher-level skills to get at a word’s meaning. But even if he can’t identify the word specifically, he can apply these higher-level skills to the context around the unknown word to guess at its meaning.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">As shown in Figure 10, although the language processes involved in comprehension and meaning are intact in someone like Alex, they cannot be called into play, because they generally can be accessed only after a word has been identified. Now we can understand why Alex, with a superior intelligence, excellent vocabulary, and boundless curiosity, cannot decipher even the simplest of words or read a passage aloud. When reading connected text silently, even if Alex can’t quite decipher a specific word, he puts his ability to think and to reason to work and uses the context around the word to guess at its meaning. Recall that Alex did much better when asked to read a passage to himself and answer questions than when asked to read isolated words. Best for him is when he can <i>listen</i> to a story, because he can use all his higher-level thinking skills to follow the narrative and answer questions about it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54" title="54"/>The impact of the phonological weakness is most obvious in reading, but it can also affect speech in predictable ways. Evidence began accumulating more than three decades ago that the core difficulty in dyslexia is getting to the sound structure of the spoken word. Researchers showed that children between four and six years of age develop an awareness that words come apart. <span id="ftn-37"/>By age six and a half to seven years most children (about 70 percent) can count the number of sounds (phonemes) they hear in small words. By this time many children have also had at least one full year of schooling, including instruction in reading. Reading and phonemic awareness are mutually reinforcing: Phonemic awareness is necessary for reading, and reading, in turn, improves phonemic awareness still further. The 30 percent of children who still cannot separate the sounds in spoken words after a year of reading instruction likely reflect the 20 to 30 percent of schoolchildren who go on to experience dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the 1980s, researchers began to address that connection explicitly. <span id="ftn-38"/>British researchers Lynette Bradley and Peter Bryant found that a preschooler’s phonological aptitude correlates with his reading three years later. They (and other investigators) also found that training a young child to attend to the sounds in spoken words before he goes to school significantly improves his success in learning to read later on. In these studies, one group of preschool children received specific training in attending to the sounds of words. They learned to categorize words based on their first, middle, or last sounds. For example, using pictures, children were taught that words could share beginning sounds (<i><span class="underline">p</span>ig, <span class="underline">p</span>an</i>), middle sounds (<i>h<span class="underline">e</span>n, p<span class="underline">e</span>t</i>), and end sounds (<i>he<span class="underline">n</span>, pi<span class="underline">n</span></i>). Another group received general language training emphasizing the meaning of words. Without question, the group receiving the sound-based training showed the most improvement in reading and spelling. This study was also important in showing that the kinds of experiences a child has before he goes to school influence his ability to read years later.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-39"/>In the 1990s we and other research groups demonstrated that phonological difficulties are the most significant and consistent markers of dyslexia in childhood. <span id="ftn-40"/>One type of test in particular seemed quite sensitive to dyslexia. This test asks a child to segment words into their phonemes and then delete specific phonemes from the words. For example, the child must say the word <i>clock</i> without the <i>k</i> sound (<i>lock</i>) or say the word <i>sour</i> without the <i>s</i> sound (<i>our</i>). A child’s performance on this test was most related to his ability to decode single words and was independent of his intelligence, vocabulary, and reasoning ability. When we gave this and other tests of phonemic awareness <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55" title="55"/>to a group of fifteen-year-olds in our Connecticut Longitudinal Study, the results were the same: <span id="ftn-41"/>Even in high school students, phonemic awareness was the best predictor of the ability to read words accurately or quickly.</p>
			<p class="indent">If dyslexia is the result of a phonologic weakness, then other consequences of impaired phonological functioning should also be apparent—and they are. When dyslexics misname objects, the incorrect responses tend to share phonological characteristics with the correct response; <i>misnaming is a result not of a lack of knowledge but of confusing the sounds of language.</i> For example, as in the series of drawings in Figure 11, a girl, Amy, shown a picture of a volcano, calls it a tornado. When given the opportunity to elaborate, Amy demonstrates that she knows what the pictured object is. She can describe the attributes and activities of a volcano in great detail and point to other pictures related to volcanoes. She simply cannot summon the word <i>volcano.</i></p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56" title="56"/>This finding converges with other evidence in suggesting that while the phonological component of the language system is impaired in dyslexia, the higher-level components remain intact. Phonologic abilities are not related to and in fact are quite independent of intelligence. Many children with superior intelligence develop dyslexia, while other children with much lower levels of intelligence catch on to reading with relative ease.</p>
			<p class="indent">The phonologic model crystallizes exactly what we mean by dyslexia. As shown in Figure 12, a circumscribed, encapsulated weakness is often surrounded by a Sea of Strengths: reasoning, problem-solving, understanding concepts, critical thinking, empathy, and vocabulary. The phonologic weakness masks what are often excellent thinking and comprehension skills. Dyslexics like Gregory use the “big picture” of theories, models, and ideas as a framework to help them remember specific details. It is true that when details are not unified by associated ideas or a theoretical framework—when, for example, Gregory must commit to memory long lists of unfamiliar names—dyslexics can be at a real disadvantage. Even if Gregory succeeds in memorizing such lists, he has trouble producing the names on demand, as he often must when he is questioned on rounds by an attending physician.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rote memorization and rapid word retrieval are particularly difficult for dyslexics. On the other hand, dyslexics appear to be disproportionately represented <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57" title="57"/>in the upper echelons of creativity and in the people who, whether in business, finance, medicine, writing, law, or science, have broken through a boundary and have made a real difference to society. I believe that this is because a dyslexic cannot simply memorize or do things rotely; she must get far underneath the concept, understand it at a fundamental level. This need often leads to a deeper understanding and a different perspective than that achieved by many of those for whom things come easier because they just can memorize and repeat, without ever having to deeply and thoroughly understand.</p>

			<p class="indent">Even when the dyslexic knows the information, needing to rapidly retrieve and orally present such information often results in retrieval of a related phoneme, such as in substituting <i>humanity</i> for <i>humidity.</i> As a result, the dyslexic may appear much less capable than he is; however, given time and when not pressured to provide instant oral responses, the dyslexic can deliver an excellent oral presentation. Similarly, dyslexics like Gregory lack reading fluency and frequently need to resort to the context to help identify specific words. This strategy slows them down further and helps explain why the provision of extra time as an accommodation is so necessary if dyslexics are to show their knowledge.</p>
			<p class="indent">As you have just read, dyslexia is primarily a problem involving the individual sounds of speech, one that impacts not only written language but spoken language as well. We now understand at a fine-grained level how difficulty getting to the sounds of spoken language explains dyslexia in all its manifestations, accounting for and predicting the full range of difficulties experienced by a dyslexic child and adult.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, one of the most troubling, and until very recently least understood, primary symptoms of dyslexia is difficulty with word retrieval. Dyslexia impacts spoken language so that the brightest thinker is often a surprisingly struggling speaker. For instance, the person may be thinking and wanting to utter “An octopus has eight tentacles” and instead finds himself saying out loud “An octopus has eight testicles.” Retrieving and uttering the wrong word impacts children and adults and brings with it great embarrassment and feelings of shame and unworthiness.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can appreciate the sense of wanting to hide quickly after uttering one of the snafus featured on our Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity website: “The dinosaurs became distinct.” “The monster is a pigment of my imagination.” “I hope I win the constellation prize.” “He had to use a fire distinguisher.”</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58" title="58"/><b>WHY SOME VERY SMART PEOPLE UTTER SOME VERY SILLY THINGS</b></h2>
			<p>While this symptom of dyslexia has been known for decades, why and how this happens remained a puzzle until recently.</p>
			<p class="indent">How could a person be so smart and yet not be able to express his thoughts accurately when speaking? Science has finally broken through and revealed the two-step neural mechanism responsible for the word-retrieval struggles of the dyslexic. At last scientific data explain how it can be that the brightest, most accomplished dyslexic—for example, a Pulitzer Prize–winning poet—can conjure up a wonderful poetic concept but when speaking to a group finds that he is tongue-tied and cannot utter the same poetic words he grasped so easily in his mind. The impact of word-retrieval difficulties cannot be emphasized enough. For this dyslexic poet, it has meant having to leave the stage, flushed with embarrassment, in the midst of a talk before an initially eager and enthusiastic and now disappointed audience. “I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to say. I can’t understand why the words just wouldn’t come out right. What’s wrong with me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">As is often the case with a person who is dyslexic, the difficulty is not in thinking or higher-level reasoning but in the lower-level mechanics of uttering the word, the actual physical act of forming the utterances leading to saying a word aloud (Figure 13).</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-42"/>The two-step mechanism accounts for how the dyslexic can use her intact higher-order thinking abilities to develop a concept and identify the abstract semantic representation of the word that represents this concept. No problem here. However, in order <i>to utter the word,</i> the speaker must go into her internal lexicon (dictionary) and access and retrieve each of the individual sounds that represent the word, for it is these smallest particles of speech that are necessary to program the articulatory muscles (lips, tongue, palate) that produce the spoken word. The result is misspeaking or a long series of <i>um</i>’s before the sought-after word is finally retrieved.</p>

			<p class="indent">This mechanism brings understanding together with profound relief to men and women who are dyslexic and to dyslexic children and their parents. The explanation proffered by this mechanism confirms that these word-retrieval difficulties are not an indication of some higher-level cognitive deficit but rather reflect a lower-level mechanical error in being able to program the muscles of articulation necessary to utter a word.</p>
			<p class="indent">As illustrated in Figure 13, an utterance begins with an idea. For example, speaking the word <i>bat</i> begins with conjuring up the concept, the idea of a small flying nocturnal creature, and holding in mind the word that represents it, <i>bat</i>. This is straightforward for both a typical reader and a person who is dyslexic. In order to put voice to the concept, to actually say the word aloud, the speaker must replace the concept with the actual sounds, the phonemes <i>/b/ /a/ /t/</i> that represent the spoken word. It is straightforward for the typical reader—in a flash he goes from concept to speech. But for a child or adult <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60" title="60"/>who is dyslexic, instead of the phonemes being crisp and clear, they appear fuzzy and indistinct. As a result, the dyslexic must search in his messy storehouse of sounds for the right sequence of sounds to fit the word, a difficult process with an unsure result. At times, in what may seem like an eternity to the speaker, what comes out of his mouth is a series of <i>um</i>’s which may end with a correct, albeit somewhat delayed, utterance of the intended word. At other times a close but not quite correct word will emerge, as when a child says, “I love to visit the <i>Oysters</i> Museum” in place of the intended <i>Cloisters.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">By identifying a phonologic weakness as the heart of dyslexia, we have taken a significant step. Now we understand the fault in the neural system for translating print into language. In the following discussion you will learn about the neural underpinnings of dyslexia and actually see, through brain activation patterns, what goes wrong.</p>
