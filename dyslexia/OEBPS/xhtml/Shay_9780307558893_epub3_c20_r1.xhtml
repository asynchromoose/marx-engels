			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>MICHELE’S PROGRAM: A MODEL THAT WORKS</b></h1>
			<p>Michele has not had an easy time at school. The daughter of a journalist and his wife, an engineer, Michele was having difficulty noticing and appreciating rhymes, and it seemed that she couldn’t stop mispronouncing words—prolonged baby talk, her pediatrician called it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Michele’s difficulties persisted, clearly affecting her grasp of print and reading. When she struggled to read in first grade, her mother was told to “give her time.” By third grade her parents were very concerned. She rarely picked up a book on her own. When her mother tried to read with her, Michele found every excuse to avoid it. Her mom felt that Michele should be tested, but her teacher said it wasn’t necessary; after her own informal testing, her teacher had concluded that Michele did not have a reading problem. Michele’s parents were fearful of antagonizing her teacher and school officials, especially given that Michele was not progressing and was dependent on her school’s support.</p>
			<p class="indent">The situation deteriorated. At home Michele sulked and was starting to avoid schoolwork of any kind. At school she was assigned a peer tutor and given extra time on the school computer. Nothing seemed to make a difference. Desperate, her family came to the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity, where Michele was tested and found to have dyslexia. With that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_276" title="276"/>evaluation in hand, Michele’s parents returned to their school, where a Pupil Placement Team (PPT) meeting was held and Michele was identified as a special needs child with a reading disability, specifically dyslexia. It was now February. She started on a reading program quite popular with teachers in the New England area. By June there was little progress. One moment she was a self-assured, graceful ballerina or a deeply immersed Lego designer, the next an insecure, flustered, stumbling reader soon to enter fourth grade. Then I met with all parties concerned.</p>
			<p class="indent">The school personnel were genuinely interested and caring, but the reading program was misguided. It included a hodgepodge of phonics activities that were not taught systematically or explicitly. As far as I could ascertain, there was no scientific evidence to support the general effectiveness of the reading instruction being employed. Moreover, this nine-year-old was being taught with two different reading programs (one with her special education teacher, one in her regular classroom) reflecting two very different reading strategies. Fluency, vocabulary growth, and reading comprehension were virtually being ignored.</p>
			<p class="indent">I was especially concerned because, as you now know, in fourth grade the emphasis is no longer on learning to read but on reading to learn. Michele continued to have difficulty with isolated words and struggled to read the required textbook for social studies. She was sure to fail subjects she had the intellect and the motivation to master. That to me was, and is, unacceptable, because effective, evidence-based reading programs for dyslexic children exist and can help almost any child.</p>
			<p class="indent">The program we designed for Michele focused on three major goals:</p>
			<p class="indent spaceabove">(1) To provide a proven type of reading intervention (that is, evidence-based) delivered with sufficient intensity by a knowledgeable teacher</p>
			<p class="indent">(2) To integrate Michele’s reading intervention with the rest of her regular classroom and schoolwork</p>
			<p class="indent">(3) To ensure that her reading status was steadily monitored</p>
			<p class="indent spaceabove">From the beginning it was critical that a responsible, knowledgeable educator take charge of Michele’s educational plan. This role seemed most natural for Ms. Griffin, the school’s new reading specialist. She and I reviewed a list of evidence-based interventions and chose the Wilson Reading System. We were impressed by the program’s evidence base and comprehensive nature, both in the content of the program itself and in the inclusion of supporting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_277" title="277"/>materials for the teachers carrying out the program. Reading is taught as part of an enriched total language experience that includes each of the major components of reading, including decoding, sight-word recognition, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension, as well as spelling. Ms. Griffin made sure to devote substantial time both to reading connected text aloud and to reading independently. Since Michele had much catching up to do, we wanted to ensure that the intervention was delivered with sufficient punch. She needed to receive instruction for a large block of time and in a small group, with maximal student-teacher interaction. We were also pleased that the Wilson Reading System offered an intensive professional development program for teachers, helping to ensure that the program would be taught effectively. Ms. Griffin had earned a Wilson Level II certification.</p>
			<p class="indent">In place of Michele’s regular classroom instruction, she is receiving at least ninety minutes of reading and language arts daily in a special small group of four students. Fluency practice—with single words, with phrases, and, importantly, with connected text—is provided daily, not as an extra if there is time but rather as an essential part of her program. The competitive part of Michele particularly enjoys the regular graphing of her fluency rates, where she can see the steady increase in the number of words she can read correctly per minute. (See <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c21_r1.xhtml#page_296">this page</a> for details on graphing fluency progress.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Michele is receiving another forty-five minutes of resource room instruction four days a week. The resource room functions as a bridge both to her regular classroom and to her home. Much of this time is devoted to integrating Michele’s reading needs with her instruction in other subject areas. Here the focus is on <i>prereading</i> and <i>rereading.</i> Working alongside her teacher, Michele is able to preread her reading assignments (for social studies, literature, and science) before she tackles them alone. She practices pronouncing difficult words by copying each word onto an index card or by using Quizlet to make index cards. Time permitting, Michele can look up the word’s meaning, use it in a sentence, read it as quickly as she can several times, and draw a relevant cartoon to remind herself of the meaning. All classroom handouts are also reviewed. Michele takes her written tests here; her teacher helps her read the questions. She receives additional time on her class tests as well as on the statewide proficiency tests.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rigorous efforts are under way to help Michele in her regular class. As I’ve said, of all in-class activities, reading aloud in front of classmates is the one feared most by students with dyslexia. In Michele’s case, if she is to read aloud in class, she is told the day before and practices the passage in question <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_278" title="278"/>with her resource room teacher and/or with a parent at home. (A child often feels more confident when she has recorded herself reading the passage aloud several times and is able to listen to how she sounds.) If she feels ready to read aloud in class, she simply raises her hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">Spelling and writing activities are integrated between her regular classroom and the resource room. Michele is expected to spell accurately the words she has learned as part of her reading program. Since spelling is more difficult than reading, if she cannot read a word, she should not be expected to spell it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Writing (handwriting and composition) is challenging for dyslexic readers. Given Michele’s penmanship difficulties, time limitations, and her facility on the computer, I recommended that she learn and become skilled at keyboarding. A good program is Typing Instructor for Kids, available from Amazon, which her parents obtained and then started using to teach her touch typing. In addition, more than other children, dyslexic readers require and greatly benefit from being directly taught writing strategies and a structure to follow in constructing sentences and in developing paragraphs. A program that is highly successful with many children, including boys and girls who are dyslexic, is Judith Hochman’s <i>Teaching Basic Writing Skills</i> (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c21_r1.xhtml#page_301">this page</a>). Michele is gradually writing more of her compositions in her regular classroom. The next step is beginning the assignment in her regular classroom and reviewing it in the resource room.</p>
			<p class="indent">Efforts in the resource room are also focused on ensuring that Michele’s afternoons and evenings at home are productive. In the resource room, Michele reviews all her homework assignments to ensure that she has read each correctly and knows what to do. I also recommended that she keep an extra set of textbooks at home. This allows a parent (or tutor) to follow along with Michele as she reads a passage aloud.</p>
			<p class="indent">The keystone in this entire process is a system of constant, seamless communication between her special small-group sessions, the resource room, and the regular classroom, as well as between school and home. A formal plan for such communication has been set in place. As I have emphasized, home is a place for reinforcement of skills and for pleasure reading. Michele should not have to depend on tutors or her parents to teach her <i>new</i> skills. At the same time, since dyslexic students benefit from practice, I view partnerships between school and home as a positive means of extending learning. I encouraged such a collaboration for Michele’s family. Her home reading reflects three specific goals:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_279" title="279"/>First, she reinforces what she is learning in class by practicing reading school-based materials <i>aloud</i> to her parents (or tutor).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Second, Michele is encouraged to read silently for pleasure. The Lexile Find a Book option, which matches a student’s reading level and her interests with the Lexile-determined text complexity of a book, helps her find just the right book to read for pleasure—one aligned both with what she enjoys reading and with what she is able to read without too much difficulty. Since Michele has a wonderful imagination and loves anything to do with fantasy, a list of books with a fantasy theme—at and a bit above her reading level—was easily generated, encouraging her to enjoy reading and want to read even more.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Third, time permitting, her parents read books to Michele that are above her current reading level, or she watches short videos on YouTube as introductory material to school assignments or to her own areas of interest. In this way (in essence reflecting the unexpected nature of dyslexia), Michele maintains access to information that is at her high intellectual level but above her lower reading level and that increases her vocabulary and expands her knowledge of the world around her that would otherwise be unavailable to her.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Together these home activities support her school instruction and help her develop fluency skills as well as the word and worldly knowledge critical for skilled reading. (Of course, these activities are not all carried out in the same evening. Reading school-based materials aloud should receive the highest priority.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Michele’s reading is continuously monitored. Progress monitoring is built into the Wilson Reading System. This ensures that the teacher is absolutely up-to-date and can use these data to build upon and plan and pace the next lesson. At the end of the school year Michele is given standardized reading tests to see how she is doing compared to others her age. For this purpose I recommend the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ-IV) test of achievement, the Test of Word Reading Efficiency, second edition (TOWRE-2), for single-word fluency, and aimsweb to measure fluency when reading connected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_280" title="280"/>text. (I will discuss approaches to teaching and measuring fluency in dyslexic children shortly.)</p>
			<p class="indent">The major work of learning should take place during school hours, when the child is most alert. At the same time:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>A tutor can perform a valuable function in helping to reinforce a child’s reading skills. A tutor can help the student practice reading aloud and apply her growing reading and writing skills to her homework assignments.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Tutors can introduce children to study skills, especially ways to organize their time and their notebooks, which have long-term benefits.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Michele’s family wanted to have the additional support of an after-school tutor. I urged that her efforts and that of the school’s reading specialist be closely coordinated; it is essential that they work together as a unified team. Under no circumstance should the tutor operate as a separate agent.</p>
			<p class="indent">Ten months after Michele began the program, she had increased her reading scores by almost two years. Most important, she had come to think of herself as a reader. She no longer guessed wildly at unfamiliar words. If she stumbled over a word, she eventually pronounced the word correctly—an unheard-of event just a few months before. When she could not fully decode a new word, she made a reasonable attempt to do so; she used her knowledge of how letters represent sounds and her excellent vocabulary to figure it out. She increasingly raised her hand in class and was for the first time even eager to be called on. She was focusing on reading words more fluently, learning how to pull apart long words, and learning about Latin-based word origins so that she could read the new words that were constantly appearing in her social studies and science texts. Michele was benefiting greatly from previewing her textbook reading assignments, identifying and then practicing difficult words. She was coming home from school eager to read a passage aloud to her parents. Spelling was still difficult, but she was improving. She had mastered keyboarding skills and was now writing her essays and book reports on a computer. This had relieved her of so much pressure that she could now concentrate on content rather than on letter formation. Having been doubtful that anything would or could help her become a reader, she was first relieved and then truly delighted by her progress, as were her parents and her teachers. The teachers started adapting Michele’s program for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_281" title="281"/>their other students with reading problems, who are now being evaluated for dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Successful programs like Michele’s should be the goal for just about any dyslexic child. Keep in mind that teaching a dyslexic child to read is founded on the same basic principles used to teach any child to read. However, since the neural systems responsible for transforming print into language may not be as responsive as in other children, <i>the instruction must be relentless and amplified in every way possible so that it penetrates and takes hold.</i> Earlier I told you that an effective reading program is predicated on a three-pronged approach involving reading intervention, integration of the intervention with regular schoolwork, and frequent monitoring of reading progress. Of course the key lies with the intervention, and this deserves special mention.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>ESSENTIALS OF A SUCCESSFUL READING INTERVENTION</b></h2>
			<p>Several essentials make up a successful reading intervention. The first is program content, which I will discuss in detail later. Here I want to focus on issues of implementation—when, how, by whom, and for how long the intervention is presented to the student—and the setting or environment in which the intervention takes place. These factors, often overlooked, will determine the ultimate success or failure of even the very best interventions. They reflect the components that were built into Michele’s program. You must ensure that each is made a part of your child’s reading program.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Early Screening, Early Diagnosis, Early Intervention.</i> The first two items are the essential first steps in successfully teaching a dyslexic child to read. The earlier they take place, the better. Because I have witnessed so many parents lose precious time by wanting to “wait a little longer” or to “give it time,” I want to emphasize that no amount of denial or rationalizing will change the situation; it only puts your child further behind and damages her self-esteem. A child needs help <i>before</i> she fails. Earlier I noted that since the publication of the first edition of this book, our group has published important data showing that the <i>achievement gap between dyslexic and typical readers is already present—and is large and persistent—in first grade.</i> These data provide validation for the need for early screening, early diagnosis, and early intervention to get ahead of dyslexia and not have to struggle so hard to catch up. So, to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_282" title="282"/>repeat, a major step to make early identification a reality is <i>to ensure that all young children are screened during kindergarten or first grade.</i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-139"/>The Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ is now being used to help identify those young children who are most at risk for dyslexia. Children who receive help early may become readers who develop accuracy and substantially improve their fluency so that they look forward to reading. A dyslexic child who is not identified until he is in third grade or later is already thousands of unlearned words behind, a gap that must be addressed if he is ever to catch up with his peers. Not being able to do what your peers seem to be able to do so effortlessly profoundly assaults a child’s sense of himself and his dreams for the future. The best approach is early screening leading to diagnosis and early intervention.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Intense Instruction.</i> This is essential for the dyslexic reader. It reflects the <i>dyslexic child’s requirement for more instruction, which is more finely calibrated and more direct.</i> The dyslexic student is behind his classmates and must make more progress than they do if he is even to begin to narrow the achievement gap. He must make a leap; if not, he will remain a long way behind.</p>
			<p class="indent">Effective reading instruction is responsive to the child’s unique needs, to her actions and to her behaviors. Her teacher must know to slow down, to repeat, to speed up, to change the pace, to find an alternative explanation, to stop. This means that the teacher must interact with her often enough to be able to detect change and adjust instruction accordingly.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Optimally, a child who is struggling to read should be in a group of no larger than four to five students with an instructor. And she should receive this specialized reading instruction four to five days a week.</i> A larger group will greatly undermine the possibility of success, since she will have far fewer opportunities to interact with her teacher and therefore will often lose interest or attention during the long pauses between being called on. With larger groups, a dyslexic student may be called on only once or even not at all during a reading session. Sadly, I have witnessed this situation far too often.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>High-Quality Instruction.</i> This is provided by a highly qualified teacher. To be a successful reader, the dyslexic child must become an active learner, one engaged by her teacher. Learning to read is a highly interactive process, rapidly resonating back and forth between teacher and child. Gaining the child’s attention requires constant effort on the part of the teacher. She must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_283" title="283"/>work diligently to involve her student, asking her questions or asking her to justify a response. (“Michele, I wonder why you would say that. Can you tell me? Where in the text is the information telling you this?”) Reading is extremely hard work for a dyslexic student, consuming and draining away huge amounts of her attention. The teacher must prevent her student from drifting away and daydreaming. A teacher is constantly delivering the necessary knowledge while at the same time working hard to ensure that it is accompanied by a “hook” that she thinks will be meaningful to the child. She is constantly thinking about how to convey this information to the child.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-140"/>Good evidence highlights the difference a teacher can make in the overall success (or failure) of a reading program. In one instance the same instructional method was used in two studies but with two different outcomes. According to the researcher who carried out both investigations, the study in which the program was most effective “employed highly skilled teachers who all had a number of years’ experience teaching children with reading disabilities,” while the other study “employed inexperienced teachers.” This is a powerful argument for ensuring that anyone who takes on such a responsibility must be a reading teacher or a teacher who has had recent training and experience in scientifically based—optimally evidence-based—methods for teaching reading. The <i>primary</i> job of teaching a dyslexic child to read should not be left to classroom aides, peer tutors, or teachers who do not possess the necessary knowledge or experience.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-141"/>In another study computers were used to teach dyslexic children comprehension strategies. The children seemed to learn the specific approaches very well but did not necessarily use what they had learned. When their teacher was seated alongside the student at the computer, the children applied the mastered strategy. When the children were alone at the computer, they did not appear to apply the strategies they had been taught.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> Learning a strategy and using a strategy are not necessarily the same. Computers are not a substitute for a good teacher.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Sufficient (Long) Duration.</i> One of the most common errors in teaching a dyslexic child to read is to withdraw prematurely instruction that seems to be working. Dyslexia is a lifelong condition and requires ongoing intervention and support to ensure that not only the child’s accuracy but also her fluency improves enough that she is reading accurately as well as rapidly <i>and with good prosody.</i></p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_284" title="284"/>CAUTION:</i> A child who is reading accurately but not fluently at grade level still requires intensive reading instruction.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">A child with dyslexia who is not identified early may require as much as <i>150 to 300 hours of intensive instruction</i> (at least sixty minutes, optimally ninety minutes or more, for most school days over a one- to three-year period) if she is going to begin to close the reading gap between herself and her peers. The longer identification and effective reading instruction are delayed, the longer the child will require to catch up.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can help ensure that your dyslexic child will learn to read by</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>getting help early, ensuring that your child is screened for dyslexia in kindergarten or first grade.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>maximizing instructional time with frequent sessions of long duration in small groups.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>insisting on qualified teachers.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>insisting on evidence-based reading programs.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">The key factors critical to successfully implementing an intervention program for dyslexic students—early screening, early diagnosis, early intervention, and intensive instruction of high quality and sufficiently long duration—were available to support Michele at her local school, but unfortunately that remains somewhat unusual. With increasing awareness and understanding of dyslexia, progress is being made, although we are not nearly where we need to be.</p>
			<p class="indent">That is why the environment or climate of a school becomes so important, affecting the impact of any implementation program for a dyslexic student. If you sense that the school your child is attending is not addressing his or her needs and doesn’t make dyslexic children feel welcome, you should consider alternatives if at all possible. A specialized school for dyslexic boys and girls would make a positive difference. At such schools all the necessities are typically present, with the addition of having <i>all</i> the teachers (rather than only the special education, resource room, and reading teachers) understand dyslexia. Moreover, the attitude toward the dyslexic student is one reflecting understanding and twenty-first-century scientific knowledge of dyslexia. The dyslexic student is part of a community of fellow dyslexic students and educators who both understand and embrace students who are dyslexic.</p>
