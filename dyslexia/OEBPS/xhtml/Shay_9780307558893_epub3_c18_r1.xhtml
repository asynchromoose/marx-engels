			<p>First grade is one of the most important for a child on the road to reading, building on the foundation provided in kindergarten. He has already taken the first and most profound step by breaking the reading code. Now he must learn the mechanics of reading, focusing on identifying the words on a page and understanding what those words mean.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most children enter first grade <i>ready to read;</i> they should leave as <i>readers</i> with a reading vocabulary of about four hundred words. They should be able to read easy books and even simple directions, spell many short words accurately, and self-correct their reading errors when the identified word doesn’t fit with cues provided by the letters in the word or with the surrounding context. These major accomplishments don’t occur by chance; they are made possible by well-structured and systematic activities that draw the child ever closer to understanding how words work. The most successful reading programs follow the model I told you about for teaching children how to break the reading code and include the following activities:</p>

			</div>
			<p>Continuing efforts to build self-esteem strengthen the program and hold the ultimate key to its success.</p>
			<p class="indent">In this chapter I will focus on the basic skills necessary for reading regular words (both big and small), on memorizing sight words, and on practicing reading.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>SOUNDING OUT SMALL WORDS</b></h2>
			<p>
				An early step in becoming an accurate reader, as we’ve seen, is learning to sound out words, beginning with simple two- and three-phoneme words like <i>zoo</i> and <i>dog</i> and going on to longer clusters of letters and sounds making up more complicated words such as <i>play, chick,</i> and <i>snail.</i> Children in first grade more rigorously begin to pull apart words and learn how to analyze and to decode progressively more challenging ones. They accomplish this by learning more about the relation of letters to sounds and by learning how to apply this knowledge to reading. As you know by now, this kind of knowledge is technically referred to as <i>phonics.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Because phonics has been associated with a particularly boring and repetitive approach to teaching reading, some have questioned its value as part of a reading curriculum. But the criticism of phonics was never a reflection of a lack of effectiveness in helping a child learn to read; rather, phonics was disparaged because of the way it was taught. Phonics has now had a makeover, retaining its core educational value but redesigned to draw children into the reading process. This is good news, since phonics provides the foundation for all subsequent reading. For your child to obtain maximum benefit from phonics, it is important that you are aware of some of the less visible and often overlooked aspects of its instruction.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>THE ESSENTIALS OF PHONICS</b></h3>
			<p>
				There are many phonics programs, of varying degrees of effectiveness. The National Reading Panel found that programs that teach phonics <i>systematically </i><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226" title="226"/>and <i>explicitly</i> (I will discuss this shortly) are the most effective. Systematic phonics is an organized method of teaching children about how letters relate to sounds. Children learn how to convert letters to specific sounds and then how to blend the sounds together to read a word. They learn how different patterns of letters represent different sounds. They learn rules, and then they learn exceptions to these rules. After a while a child has the knowledge required to analyze and to identify just about any word he encounters. This is the goal of systematic phonics instruction. What is so critical and so unique about learning phonics in this way is that it allows the reader to apply his accumulating knowledge to deciphering and reading words he has never seen before. No other method of teaching reading can make this claim.</p>
			<p class="indent">In general, systematic phonics programs progressively introduce the child to different letter-sound pairings, beginning with the simplest, most consistent, and most frequent combinations and then gradually expanding to cover more complex and unusual ones. A typical program might begin by teaching:</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Simple One-to-One, Letter-Sound Relationships.</i> Here the focus is on those consonants where there is a predictable one-to-one relationship between a letter and its sound (typically in the letters <i>b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, p, r, t, v, w,</i> and <i>z</i>). With rare exceptions, there is only one way to pronounce each of these letters so that they are consistently linked to the same sound. <i>Dear, sledding,</i> or <i>pad</i>—the sound <i>d</i> is always the same.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Vowel Sounds.</i> In order to read words, children need to learn about vowel sounds, too. Vowels tend to be more difficult to pronounce than consonants. They can be <i>long</i> or <i>short.</i> Children are taught that long vowels “say their names” (the <i>a</i> sound in <i>cake,</i> the <i>e</i> sound in key, and the <i>i</i> sound in time). Short vowels do not—for example, <i>cap, help,</i> and <i>t</i>i<i>p</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent">In systematic programs, specific sets of letters, generally six to eight consonants and two vowels, are taught as a unit. Once they are mastered, children go on to another set. Initial groupings typically contain several of the consonants noted above plus the vowels <i>a</i> and <i>i</i>, because the sounds of these two vowels are the easiest to distinguish from one another. Once a child knows the sounds of her first group of consonants and vowels, she is excited because she can now begin to link these letters to their sounds and then blend these sounds together and read the word on the page. These simple consonant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227" title="227"/>and vowel combinations are used to make the words in a child’s first books and are the focus of reading instruction in first grade. By the middle of first grade, a child should be able to sound out a growing number of these words.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Complex Letter-Sound Patterns.</i> Having mastered one sound-one letter linkages, the child is ready for links where letters and sounds do not invariably have a one-to-one relationship. Here the focus is on patterns where, for example, two letters may represent one speech sound; these combinations are referred to as <i>digraphs.</i> Although they sound quite technical, digraphs are very common—<i>sh-</i> as in <i>ship, ch-</i> as in <i>chip, -ng</i> as in <i>sing, th-</i> as in <i>thing, wh-</i> as in <i>when.</i> These (and other) more complicated letter-sound relationships are generally taught during first grade and continue into second. As children progress, they are surprised to learn that not only are there digraphs, there are also <i>trigraphs</i> (<i>-dge</i> as in <i>wedge, -tch</i> as in <i>itch</i>) and even <i>quadrigraphs</i> (<i>-eigh</i> as in <i>weigh, -ough</i> as in <i>tough</i>). To give you a sense of how helpful it is to learn these patterns, imagine trying to pronounce the letters <i>-dge (ledge</i>) or <i>eigh</i> (<i>sleigh</i>) if you haven’t been taught that they group together to make one pronounceable sound.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Rules.</i> Children are taught useful rules that help them figure out the correct pronunciation of different letter patterns. A child learns that <i>the pronunciation of a letter sometimes depends on what letters come after it.</i> In first grade children are taught the <i>silent e rule:</i> a vowel followed by a consonant and then an <i>e,</i> as in <i>t-ake,</i> d<i>-ime,</i> or h<i>-ome</i> is typically pronounced as a long vowel. They also learn that the letter <i>c</i> may be pronounced as <i>k</i> when it is followed by <i>a, o,</i> or <i>u</i> (<i>ca</i>ke<i>, co</i>me<i>, cu</i>p) or followed by any consonant (<i>cl</i>ap or <i>cr</i>ack), or as <i>ssss</i> if followed by <i>e, i,</i> or <i>y</i> (<i>ce</i>nt, cinema, or <i>cy</i>clone). Such rules help to encourage the rising reader to look at all the letters in a word.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Spelling.</i> Although technically not part of phonics instruction, spelling is intimately related to reading and to the relation of letters to sounds. As children learn to read words, they also begin to learn how to spell these words. In fact, a child should never be asked to spell a word she can’t read. Serious spelling instruction begins in the middle of first grade, although children are generally not held to accurate spellings until they are in second grade.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228" title="228"/>Effective spelling instruction is more than rote memorization of word lists. Spelling (<i>encoding,</i> going from sound to letter) strongly reinforces reading (<i>decoding,</i> going from letter to sound), and its instruction should be linked to a child’s reading lesson. Like reading, spelling instruction follows a logical sequence that begins with phonemic awareness and then learning which letters represent which specific sounds. As a child reads more and learns more words, he begins to appreciate that the same sound can have different spellings; for example, he learns that the <i>a</i> sound can be spelled in different ways, such as <i>mate, weight,</i> and <i>straight.</i> Through spelling lessons as well as his own reading, a child learns the most frequent letter patterns for different sounds. Initially it is best to stress the most frequent spellings and try not to overwhelm a child with every possible spelling of a sound. In this case, <i>mate</i> would be the most common spelling for the <i>a</i> sound.</p>
			<p class="indent">As children progress they are introduced to spelling strategies they can apply to help spell new words. They also learn about so-called irregular (sight) words, whose sounds and spellings don’t match the rules they have been taught (for example, <i>should</i> and <i>colonel</i>); the spelling of these words must be memorized. Children vary widely in their spelling abilities, although children who are dyslexic experience by far the most severe and longest-lasting difficulties producing accurate spellings.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>TWO APPROACHES TO IDENTIFYING WORDS</b></h3>
			<p>
				In teaching reading, <i>what</i> is taught is as important as <i>how</i> it is taught, especially for children who may be dyslexic. It is crucial for children to develop a strong foundation of understanding letter-sound relationships. This requires an early focus on phonics, knowledge that children can then apply to decode words they come across in their reading. <i>Dyslexic children require much more intense, frequent, and extended phonics instruction.</i> As I said, effective reading programs teach children about phonics not only systematically but <i>explicitly</i> as well. There is no subtle or subliminal teaching here; children are not left to their own devices. In general, systematic phonics programs also directly teach letter-sound relationships. “Synthetic phonics” is a prime example of one such program type. Children are systematically taught <i>code-based instruction</i>—that is, to transform letters into sounds and then to blend (synthesize) the sounds together to form a pronounceable word. This is in contrast to what are often described as <i>whole-language</i> reading programs, which may lightly touch on teaching phonics but not with the early, consistent emphasis on code-based instruction. Typically, within such whole-language <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229" title="229"/>programs there is not such a strong emphasis on having children systematically and explicitly work on analyzing and pulling apart words. The focus is not primarily on the sounds of language but on meaning. Early on, children are given books to “read” or to have read to them. Decoding is lightly touched on but is not a major or primary focus of instruction. It is assumed that reading is acquired “naturally,” just as speech is (as we know, an incorrect assumption). In this view, letter-sound relationships will be learned naturally, seemingly by osmosis, as children are surrounded by literature and exposed to printed materials. According to this view, there is no reason for a major focus on teaching phonics systematically or explicitly; children will figure it out on their own, or at least with small word-study minilessons rather than a full-blown emphasis.</p>
			<p class="indent">The two approaches differ markedly in how children are instructed to approach unfamiliar printed words. Phonics instructs a child to try to analyze the word and to sound it out, while whole-language emphasizes guessing the word from the context of the story or from pictures accompanying the story. In phonics, the clues to identifying the word lie <i>within</i> the word itself, and children are encouraged to attend to the finer points of the word’s structure. In whole-language, the clues are <i>external</i> to the word and are to be derived from the meaning of the story. The National Reading Panel found that children who are taught phonics systematically and explicitly make greater progress in reading than with any other type of instruction. Good evidence indicates that beginning teaching phonics in kindergarten or first grade produces the best results. Once a child demonstrates that she has some understanding of how spoken language works, it is time to learn how letters link to these sounds. In general, phonics instruction extends over two school years. All children benefit from it.</p>
			<p class="indent">First-grade instruction in phonics not only helps children learn how to sound out and pronounce words, improving reading accuracy, it also helps reading comprehension. <span id="ftn-122"/>As children reach higher grades, reading more complicated texts, phonics tends to influence reading comprehension far less. This is reasonable, since reading comprehension in lower grades involves reading very simple words that are usually quite familiar to a child. If he can decode the word, he generally knows what it means. At higher grades, reading involves more complicated and unfamiliar words. To comprehend what he is reading, the reader must not only be able to pronounce the word, he must also know what the word means, which is not taught as a major part of phonics instruction.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_230" title="230"/>Phonics also helps spelling, and the earlier it is taught, the more effective it is. This is not surprising, since phonics concentrates on how letters represent sounds in words, which, after all, is what spelling is about. As a child progresses in school, he learns new words that are more likely to contain irregular spellings; that is, their spelling is not fully predictable by phonics rules. So with time, as discussed below, children learn strategies to figure out larger and more complicated words, and as a result, phonics has less of an effect on a child’s spelling.</p>
			<p class="indent">The quality and quantity of materials available to most effectively teach reading are better than ever. As noted, teachers and parents have available many choices for teaching phonics and phonemic awareness, including programs such as Lexia, Ooka Island, and Headsprout.</p>
			<p class="indent">To repeat, a typical course for phonics instruction begins in first grade, or today increasingly in kindergarten, and continues through second grade. Once a child is comfortably able to read most one-syllable words, the emphasis switches from phonics to learning strategies for figuring out increasingly longer and more complex words. However, children will vary in their progress, so that some may experience difficulty and need phonics instruction to continue into later grades. The classroom instructional time devoted to phonics per se need not be long—perhaps fifteen to twenty minutes a day. This is reinforced many times a day through all the other activities in a child’s reading program and by encouraging the child to read and to write independently.</p>
			<p class="indent">After first grade, reading instruction systematically moves along. Instruction in the second and third grades reinforces the basic principles of teaching reading with the goal of encouraging the child to read more and to read increasingly more complex books independently. By the end of second grade, a child should be selecting, reading, and enjoying chapter books, as well as spelling words correctly and writing his own little stories.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>TAKING APART BIGGER WORDS</b></h2>
			<p>
				In third grade and especially fourth grade and higher, reading instruction adds a new dimension by focusing on big words. In the same way that a beginning reader learns how to pull apart simple words, a maturing reader requires a strategy to analyze the longer and more complicated words he encounters. <span id="ftn-123"/>A child <i>learns to read</i> in grades one through three but <i>reads to learn</i> (acquire new information) in grades four through eight. Certainly by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231" title="231"/>fourth grade a child begins to study specific subject areas and to do so in increasing depth, bringing about a sharp increase in the number and complexity of printed words he will confront in his daily schoolwork. He is now expected to read multisyllabic words, and the strategies he adopts to tackle them are straightforward, revolving around the basic idea of systematically breaking a multisyllabic word into smaller chunks. The goal is to teach a child how to figure out where there are natural breaks in a word. Once the printed word is pulled apart, the child uses his knowledge of letter-sound relationships to further analyze each smaller part.</p>
			<p class="indent">Over time children progressively learn how to tackle these longer words. This instruction often begins during first grade, when a child is introduced to compound words such as <i>inside</i> and <i>goldfish</i> and taught that they can be separated into two parts (<i>in</i> and <i>side, gold</i> and <i>fish</i>). During second grade children are taught explicit strategies for figuring out how to analyze more complicated long written words, and this is emphasized even more in third grade. The most useful approach is first to divide a word according to where its syllables naturally break. Syllables contain one vowel <i>sound</i> (although they may have more than one vowel letter, as in <i>toe</i> or <i>bait</i>). Vowel sounds are made by opening the mouth. (Because of this anatomical relationship, you can often tell the number of syllables by simply counting the number of times your jaw moves as you say a word. You can also put your fingers on your jaw and feel its movement as you articulate different words. Say the word <i>jaw</i> and you’ll note one movement; say the word <i>scarecrow</i> and you’ll sense two.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Using these strategies, a child can break apart a surprising number of words. Once a student is able to pull apart a word into its syllables, she can then analyze each syllable into its phonemes, blend the sounds together, and pronounce the word. <i>Practice is critical.</i> Children do best when they feel confident enough to take a stab at pronouncing these strange words and are able to laugh at their own errors, and at the same time work to self-correct their mistakes. There is no substitute for practice, guidance, and feedback; practice, self-correction, and more practice.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are several helpful strategies for children learning to divide multisyllabic words. Here are the most useful.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Dividing a Long Word Between the Two Consonants.</i> A word like <i>kitten</i> becomes <i>kit-ten.</i> The child sounds out each syllable, <i>kit → k i t,</i> and <i>ten → t e n,</i> and then blends the sounds together, <i>k i t, t e n,</i> and the word <i>kitten</i> is pronounced perfectly.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232" title="232"/><i>Knowing Word Derivations.</i> If a child knows how words are built, how they are put together, he will also know how to take them apart. Children progressively learn about prefixes, suffixes, and word origins—first Anglo-Saxon and then Latin roots, and still later Greek origins of English words. These forms are referred to as <i>morphemes,</i> parts of words in the English language that, although small, convey meaning. The prefix begins a word (<i>im</i> means not; impure means <i>not</i> pure). The suffix ends it (<i>-er</i> means one who does; a photographer is one who photographs). If your child recognizes a prefix or a suffix, and in some cases both, he is better prepared to unhitch the parts of a potentially unwieldy word. For example, the word <i>unsinkable</i> has two common affixes<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c18-ftn-1" id="c18-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup>: the prefix <i>un-,</i> meaning not, and the suffix <i>-able,</i> meaning having the ability to. Once your child knows frequently used affixes such as <i>un-</i> and <i>-able</i>, he can pull apart a long word like <i>unsinkable (un-sink-able)</i>, pronounce it correctly, and know that it refers to something that cannot be sunk.</p>
			<p class="indent">Knowing the etymology or the roots of a word is a very powerful aid to reading, shedding light on a word’s pronunciation, its spelling, and its meaning. For example, knowing the Latin root <i>script</i>, meaning to write, can be helpful in subdividing words like <i>manuscript</i> and <i>transcript</i> and in knowing that each has to do with writing. In the same way, knowledge of Greek stems is indispensable to those interested in science or technology. It is very useful for a student to know that <i>ology</i> (<i>ol-ogy</i>) means the study of; now he can decipher and know the meaning of a whole range of potentially difficult and academically important words, including <i>zoology</i> (the study of animals), <i>biology</i> (the study of living organisms and life processes), and <i>meteorology</i> (the study of the atmosphere, especially the weather).</p>
			<p class="indent">Even the most obscure and complicated-appearing words can be broken down into more manageable units and deciphered if the reader is aware of their derivation or roots. Without this knowledge, it is difficult for students to read any but the simplest of texts. Children who are not able to unhitch long words are forced to skip over these words or to give them made-up names, like <i>asty</i> or <i>Amy</i> for <i>astronomy.</i> Doing so allows the child to read through the text, but since he guesses a different word each time he encounters the word <i>astronomy</i>, it is as if he is seeing the word for the first time and hasn’t reinforced the neural components—representing the sounds, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233" title="233"/>meaning, and the orthographic elements—that must come together to form the word. In essence, he does not have the neural components of the word in a well-elaborated, mature, ready position to come together so that he can recognize the word when he comes across it. As a result, he will not recognize the word when his teacher talks about astronomy the next day in class or when he comes across the word <i>astronomy</i> again in a book.</p>
			<p class="indent">Children learn how to read words in a systematic, logical progression. Those who can easily read most small words and have a strategy for approaching longer, more complex ones are mature readers. They are ready to apply their skills to technical or specialized words in textbooks and to uncommon words in literature. They are also adept at using the dictionary to confirm spellings or to look up exact meanings.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP YOUR CHILD</b></h2>
			<p>Below is the most important information you will need to help your child become a reader. I’ve divided the information into a section on school—the specific questions you want to ask about your child’s reading program—and one on the home, focusing on the kinds of activities you as a parent can do with your child to encourage his development as a reader.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>AT SCHOOL</b></h3>
			<p>One of the questions I am asked most frequently concerns how to choose a reading program that works. The publication of the findings of the National Reading Panel in 2000 represented a milestone in national efforts to translate scientific knowledge of reading into practice. For example, the report includes each of the elements the panel found to be effective, including the amount of time needed to teach reading and language arts (as much as 150 minutes a day in grades one and two), and stipulates that extra time (thirty to forty-five minutes a day) should be built in to permit practice and reinforcement for those children who need extra help or enrichment for those who are ahead of the curve. Since the publication of the report’s findings, publishers have worked very hard to update their reading materials to incorporate the most effective, scientifically supported, and, most critically, evidence-based teaching methods.</p>

However, given the variability in reading skills within a class, components such as basic phonologic skills and oral reading are best addressed in smaller groups. You want to ask how large instructional groups are. Children who are dyslexic require <i>intense</i> instruction in reading. <span id="ftn-124"/>As the National Reading Panel noted, this translates into small groups, anywhere from four to five students to individualized one-to-one or one-to-two instruction. It is clear that if a student is in a larger group, she is rarely called on, perhaps once during a forty-five-minute period, if at all. When not called upon, the struggling reader begins to disconnect from the group’s goings-on because they are too difficult to follow, and she spends much of the time staring out the window or getting into trouble. The grouping should be flexible for each component of reading, so that a child can move in and out of a group depending on his progress and level of skill in that particular area. Children who are progressing more slowly will benefit from smaller groups and more intense attention to that skill. Overall, dyslexic children require a lot of individualized attention, along with repetition and practice, in order to truly benefit from reading instruction.</p>

Ideally, the teacher models reading for the child and then provides feedback and guidance as the student rereads the selection aloud. Of course, how much feedback and guidance is given and its nature are best determined by direct observation while visiting your child’s classroom.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Ongoing assessment.</i> The child’s reading skills should be assessed both by informal teacher observation and by more formal measures such as aimsweb or DIBELS (see <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236" title="236"/><a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c21_r1.xhtml#page_291">this page</a>). As I will discuss later, measuring your dyslexic child’s progress in reading needs to be an ongoing process in order to reflect his changing needs. <i>In the primary grades (one to three), his reading should be assessed at least three times during the school year</i> to monitor growth, more often if there are indications of failure to make progress.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 class="head"><b>AT HOME</b></h3>
			<p>While a parent should not become her child’s primary teacher, she can become her child’s biggest helper. With a light hand, good humor, and the suggestions I make here, you can help accelerate your child’s progress. In most instances I strongly caution parents against setting out to teach their child all the phonics rules or a complete reading curriculum. Teaching reading is a complex task, one that should be left to a professional. Keep in mind that your child is in class for perhaps six hours a day. You will see him after school, when he is tired and less receptive to learning and when you, too, are not your most energetic or patient self. I recommend that you work with your child fifteen or twenty minutes a few evenings a week; it should remain fun and not a chore for either one of you. For the most part, weekends should be left for enjoyment and not to play catch-up.</p>
			<p class="indent">Focus on reinforcement. School is where <i>new</i> learning should take place; home is ideal for <i>practice</i> and <i>reinforcement.</i> School helps him build the necessary neural components for reading; home practice strengthens and solidifies these components. Make an effort to coordinate any home reading activity with what your child is learning in school. Children do best when they can focus on one procedure, one approach at a time, so work in harmony with your child’s teacher.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reinforce selected basic skills that will make reading more understandable and ultimately more enjoyable for your child. I will give you a list of children’s books that are right for him, that he will enjoy reading, and that will stimulate him to want to read more. I will recommend activities that are easy to do and require little more than a stack of index cards, magnetic letters, a felt marking pen, and a highlighter pen. For some of the activities I recommend colored as well as white index cards. Alternatively, many students have found using electronic index cards—for example, the app Quizlet—is not only helpful but fun as well. With Quizlet you can create your own personal cards or choose one from the extremely large selection of cards other users have created.</p>

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_237" title="237"/><i>Sounding Out Smaller Words.</i> Like most other behaviors, how we read will reflect the habits we develop through instruction and practice. You can play an important role in ensuring that your child develops good reading habits by encouraging certain behaviors. One of the most important is to learn to sound out words and to do so early. Whenever your child comes across a word he is unsure of, encourage him to try to sound it out. You can begin by asking him about the first sound. For example, if the word is <i>sat,</i> you can say with some exaggeration, “The first letter is <i>sss.</i> What is the sound of <i>sss</i>?” Repeat the process with the last sound, <i>t,</i> and then the middle sound, <i>aah.</i> Once he is able to articulate <i>s a t,</i> ask him to blend the sounds together rapidly and say <i>sat.</i> Ask him if this sounds right to him. Does it make sense in the story? He will be practicing good reading habits: first decoding an unknown word and then verifying that his pronunciation is accurate. By teaching him to ask himself these questions automatically, you are also fostering his independence as a reader and building his self-confidence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Speak to your child’s teacher and ask what sounds and strategies your child is working on and what you can do to help her practice. If the teacher isn’t able to provide you with any suggestions, you can ask her about some of the activities I have listed below. I have selected several of the simplest and most useful strategies. These are relatively easy for you to practice with your child and will help her to pull apart literally hundreds of words that she might otherwise give up on. These are also helpful when you are reading with your child. If she stumbles on a word dependent on one of these strategies for its pronunciation, after you finish a page or story you can use the troublesome word as an opportunity to review the rule. These strategies will allow your child, for example, to correctly pronounce words following the <i>silent e rule,</i> so that she knows the difference between words like <i>mate</i> and <i>mat,</i> and words containing the letter <i>c,</i> to determine when a <i>c</i> is said softly, as in <i>cereal</i> and <i>cinder,</i> or makes a hard sound, as in <i>camel</i> and <i>clock</i> (I refer to this as the <i>saying c’s rule</i>).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">Below are specific details about each of the activities described above. Begin with the ones focused on short words and then, after checking with your child’s teacher, introduce your child to the strategies meant for older children with stronger reading skills in place. The most useful rule and the one taught earliest is:</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>The Secret of the Silent E Rule.</i> Focus on and reinforce the <i>silent e rule</i> more than the others. Since it affects many words, it is extremely useful to a novice reader. It is also simple to get across: (1) tell your child the rule, (2) show him several examples, and (3) practice applying the rule to different words. You will need a stack of index cards with pairs of words printed on them, words with and without the silent <i>e</i> at the end. Again, electronic index cards using Quizlet may be helpful.</p>
			<p class="indent">For step one, tell your child, “Some words have a secret code that tells you how to say them. The <i>silent e</i> code helps you to read many, many words. Listen, here is the code.” Look for a word where there is a vowel followed by a consonant and then a final <i>e</i>—which makes the vowel say its own name (vowel, consonant, <i>silent e</i>)—and write down some examples, like <i>rate, fine, same.</i></p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Sequentially, point to the vowel, the consonant, and the <i>silent e</i> at the end and then say each word.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Play a game in which one form of a word is magically transformed into another. You will need the index cards with the pairs of words (for example, <i>pan/pane</i>) printed on them.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Practice reading one form of the word and then the other. For example, first read the word <i>hid</i>, then point to its cousin with the silent <i>e</i> at the end, <i>hide</i>, and read it, <i>hide</i>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_239" title="239"/>Repeat this for each of the words, then ask your child to do the same. Once he seems to have grasped the idea, alternate, sometimes beginning with the word with the silent <i>e</i> and then reading the other word (<i>rate,</i> then <i>rat</i>). At other times, start with the short form (<i>rat</i>) followed by the word with the silent <i>e</i> at the end (<i>rate</i>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">You can then apply the rule to real-life reading. Ask your child to get a book that he is familiar with and enjoys. With you by his side, have him take a highlighter and mark and read each word following the <i>silent e</i> code. Your child will master the exercise and enjoy his ability to read the many words he can now decipher with his secret code.</p>

			<p class="indent">Let your child’s progress guide you. If your child seems to have trouble with a word, add it to the next week’s words as well. Try to point out and highlight the week’s special words whenever you come across them in books, magazines, or newspapers. These words can be put on Quizlet cards and placed in your child’s Word Bank.</p>
			<p class="indent">Since sight words are so common and so well represented among the most frequently used words in print, the best long-term approach to mastering them is to gradually help your child memorize these words, a few at a time. Here is a list of the 150 most common words found in printed English according to the <i>Word Frequency Book.</i> The words are listed in order of their frequency. As you skim them, you will immediately notice that the vast majority are sight words.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Because these words are so common, it is necessary for a would-be reader to be able to decipher these little words on sight. Reviewing a few each week should give your child a head start in reading most beginning books. <span id="ftn-125"/>More extensive word lists may be found listed as Fry Sight Words (<a href="https://sightwords.com">https://sightwords.com</a>) or in the word lists on VocabularySpellingCity (<a href="http://www.spellingcity.com">www.spellingcity.com</a>).</p>

			<p><i>Practicing Reading Connected Text.</i> One of the most important components of a complete reading program is for the child to begin to read connected text, not just words in isolation, and to do so early. Reading connected text should be considered an essential part of a lesson, not just an add-on if there is time remaining. Reading connected text provides a child an opportunity not only to increase her vocabulary and background knowledge but to improve her ability to read individual words by allowing her to see words in different contexts, which may influence both how the words are pronounced and their meaning. For example, the letters <i>gh</i> when occurring at the <i>beginning</i> of a word are pronounced <i>g,</i> as in <i>ghetto.</i> However, when <i>gh</i> occurs at the <i>end</i> of a word it can be pronounced <i>f,</i> as in <i>enough,</i> or can be <i>silent,</i> as in <i>through.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Again, practice is the key to becoming a skilled reader. Without it, a child may see a word and then have it float out of his mind forever. With it, he will be able to etch the word components—phonology, the way the word sounds; semantics, what it means; orthography, the way the word looks—into his memory circuits in ready reserve until they are needed again.</p>
			<p class="indent">Very simple principles guide the choice of reading materials your child should practice with. Beginning readers need to be exposed to books that are easy and fun to read. With these books the child is in familiar territory, since most of the words they contain are already registered in the reading circuits of his brain. These books help to consolidate reading skills already learned. Repeated practice with them is the key to reinforcing and strengthening the neural wiring for the specific components of individual words and word families. Children also benefit from reading somewhat more difficult books, especially books they choose, which reflect their interest or curiosity. With a teacher (or parent) available to provide guidance and to answer questions, reading such books allows the child to expand his knowledge of letter-sound linkages and of exceptions to the rules, and to learn new vocabulary words and concepts.</p>
			<p class="indent">In practice, a child starts with the simplest books, and as he learns more letters and sounds and more sight words, he gradually works his way up to longer and more interesting books. But at the very beginning, for the sheer pleasure of being able to read on his own—and for the confidence it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_247" title="247"/>builds—nothing works as well as the small decodable booklets and the more recently available Geode readers I mentioned earlier.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you read one to your child, chances are that he will want to reread it on his own over and over again. Children like to read these simple books because they <i>can.</i> In the previous chapter I mentioned several good series to start with, in particular Bob Books by Bobby Lynn Maslen. At the beginning, I would make it a habit first to read a book to your child and then to sit with him as he reads it back to you. This ensures that he can read the book and that you will be there to offer assistance if he comes across an unexpectedly difficult word. When you read with him, you can support him by</p>

			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248" title="248"/>To read a book with ease, a child should be able to read about nineteen out of twenty words on a page correctly. This is especially important for children in kindergarten or first grade, who are just beginning to learn to read. Views about how best to select reading materials for boys and girls in second grade and above are undergoing change from the previous belief that children in all grades should be matched to books at their instructional level—that is, that can be read with 90 percent to 95 percent accuracy—to more recent thoughts that it might be best for them to be exposed to and read texts at varying levels, giving the students’ choice and interest more weight. For their independent reading, students in fact tend to choose texts that are above their instructional level. A proponent of having students read books of varying text difficulty, from easy to difficult, Professor Tim Shanahan, Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago, argues that in selecting reading materials, students’ <span id="ftn-126"/>“curiosity about the content of the harder materials outweighs their fear of failure.” Studies have not supported the widely held belief that limiting reading materials to texts at the student’s instructional level leads to improved reading or interest in reading. However, if a student selects a book at a higher reading level, it is important for an adult to be close by to help him if he cannot pronounce a word, or to define it if he does not know its meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">During a recent summer, when my seven-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter, about to enter second grade, visited, I learned how important a child’s interest in a book’s topic can be. She had chosen a story of sisters and their relationship to one another. I read the first few chapters with her, the two of us alternating reading a few pages. She became engrossed in the story. Soon she left for home, clutching the book in her hand. I wondered if she would continue reading it after she left. Several hours later her father sent me a wonderful photo of her sitting on the couch with a big smile on her face and the book held up in front of her. She had finished the book and was now asking her dad to order another book on the same topic. Earlier I had turned the book over and had seen that it was recommended for children in the fifth grade.</p>
			<p class="indent">An unusual group of texts, Wit &amp; Wisdom<sup>®</sup>, available from the nonprofit Great Minds<sup>®</sup> organization, offer the early reader knowledge while appealing to his interest in an unusually wide range of topics. Wit &amp; Wisdom<sup>®</sup> has now joined with the Wilson Reading System Fundations<sup>®</sup> program to produce the aforementioned Readables, specifically the reading series Geodes, which provides interesting content while being aligned with the Fundations<sup>®</sup> program for teaching beginning reading.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249" title="249"/>For parents of beginning readers, it is particularly helpful to know the reading level of a book. There are aids to help you do exactly that. One, the Lexile Framework, matches students to books by using a common measure, the Lexile unit. Lexile levels extend from zero to about 1,700, with second- to third-grade students typically reading in the Lexile range between 420 and 820. In this system <i>The Cat in the Hat</i> is scored at 260 Lexile units, <i>Charlotte’s Web</i> at 680, <i>Ethan Frome</i> at 1,160, and <i>Silent Spring</i> at 1,340. Parents and others can access the Lexile Framework at <a href="http://www.lexile.com">www.lexile.com</a>. Another system, the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) (<a href="http://www.questarai.com/drp">www.questarai.com/drp</a>), lists children’s books according to their reading level. The information is available in the form of “Readability Reports” in two broad categories, “Readability of Literature and Popular Titles” and “Readability of Textbooks.”</p>
			<p class="indent">For discovering a book’s level of difficulty when you are at a library, you can turn to <i>Children’s Books in Print,</i> which sorts books by title, author, and subject matter. Libraries subscribe and are able to access this resource.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the Appendix you will find lists of books for children, including picture books, poetry, easy readers, picture books with rhymes/pattern repetition, and transitional chapter books. Consider that selection a starting point for further exploration. Your local library has a treasury of good books, and you might also want to consult the lists of recommended works in such guides as</p>

			<p class="indent">Magazines provide inviting bite-sized reading materials for every age and every interest. Providing materials of genuine interest helps to make reading <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250" title="250"/>a habit, encouraging practice that builds automatic reading systems. Beginning readers eagerly anticipate the latest arrival of their very own magazine full of simple stories that they can read, as well as fun activities and puzzles. For children three to six, <i>Ladybug</i> magazine introduces poems, rhymes, and songs. <i>Spider</i> is geared for children six to nine who are becoming independent readers. <i>ASK</i> targets the same age range but is aimed at what the publisher refers to as “curious” children who like to ask questions. <i>ASK</i> particularly focuses on the arts and science. <i>MUSE</i> has a somewhat similar focus on science and the arts but also includes technology and many jokes for children nine to fourteen. <i>Cricket</i>’s audience is nine- to fourteen-year-olds; it has wonderful stories, puzzles, and contests that are appealing to children who are now reading to learn and to enjoy themselves. CricketMedia also publishes a number of more specialized magazines for children, such as <i>Dig into History,</i> a history and archaeology magazine for children nine to fourteen. You can subscribe to any of these by contacting <a href="http://www.cricketmagazine.com">www.cricketmagazine.com</a>. <i>Ranger Rick,</i> devoted to nature, science, and the outdoors, is filled with beautiful photographs and is ideal for curious children seven to twelve, while <i>Ranger Rick Jr.</i> is geared for children four to seven. Subscriptions are available from the National Wildlife Federation at <a href="http://www.nwf.org">www.nwf.org</a>. To introduce children to current events, I suggest <i>TIME for Kids,</i> a newsmagazine geared for students in grades K–6. All editions contain feature news stories, many contributed by children. Suggested activities and subscriber information are available at <a href="http://www.timeforkids.com">www.timeforkids.com</a>. For children ages six through twelve who crave sports-related stories, <i>Sports Illustrated Kids</i> (<a href="http://www.sikids.com">www.sikids.com</a>) covers all major organized sports teams (NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB) as well as extreme sports.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even if you choose a book or magazine that turns out to be too difficult for your child, you can always do shared reading, in which you read most of the publication but pause when you come to a word your child can read, sound out, or predict successfully. Once your child learns to read words accurately, she is ready for the next step. In that phase of her reading development, she will not only read words correctly, she will read them smoothly and rapidly—without giving it a second thought. How she becomes that fluent reader and what you can do to help her achieve that is the subject to which I now turn.</p>
