			<p>In addition to providing the loving and nurturing that come naturally with parenting, parents (and teachers, too) of children with dyslexia should make their number-one goal the preservation of their child’s self-esteem. This is the area of greatest vulnerability for children who are dyslexic. Teachers and parents often hold high expectations for a child who is harboring a hidden disability and then are surprised, disappointed, or even angry when the child does not perform well in school. If he is accused often of not working hard enough, of not being motivated, or of not really being that smart after all, the child soon begins to doubt himself. The enormous effort and extraordinary perseverance he must expend just to keep up seem to have no payoff. That is why understanding by parents, by teachers, and ultimately by the child of the nature of his reading problem is critical in helping a child to develop a positive sense of himself.</p>
			<p class="indent">An unwavering commitment to the intrinsic value of a child with dyslexia is essential. Every dyslexic child is invariably going to endure ups and downs in his school experiences. So early on, each child needs to know that no matter what, he can always count on his parents for unconditional support. All dyslexics who have become successful by any account share the unfailing love and support of their parent(s) or a grandparent, teacher, or spouse. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_305" title="305"/>Parents must always be there for the child where and when he needs it: in ensuring early screening by his school, in seeking out an accurate diagnosis and then an effective intervention, in helping to make sure that school is a positive experience, in exposing him to the world, and in reading with him and perhaps for him. Those who support a dyslexic child must always remind that child of his value as a person.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are a number of specific steps you can take to build your child’s self-image. The first is to let him know the nature of his reading problem. Children are greatly relieved to learn why they have so much difficulty reading. Such knowledge brings with it the light of self-awareness and self-advocacy, which in turn build the road to self-esteem and empowerment. Fred’s story illustrates that.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fred, a middle-school student, had just been diagnosed as dyslexic. His parents worried that knowing his diagnosis would discourage Fred and somehow throw him off track and have him lose confidence in himself. They feared that knowing his diagnosis might somehow negatively alter Fred’s self-perception and disrupt his relationship with peers.</p>
			<p class="indent">I sat down alone with Fred and explained his dyslexia, reviewing his history and performance. I spoke about dyslexia in the context of what it is, what it affects, and what it does not affect (intelligence). Fred asked some probing questions, and then, with a great sigh of relief, responded, “I am still the same person. The only difference is that I now know the nature of my difficulty and its name, and most importantly, I understand myself and how I learn and what I can do to help myself.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Fred looked as if the weight of the world had been taken off his shoulders. He is doing very well at home, with peers, and in school, where he is now able to speak to his teachers about any modifications he needs, including test accommodations and not taking two finals in one day. His new self-awareness led to confidence and positive experiences and opened him to new visions of a future far beyond his previous limited dreams.</p>

			<p class="indent">After one of my patients, Phillip, shared his MRI with his third-grade classmates and told them he had dyslexia, his teacher wrote me to say the children were curious about it and had the following questions (my responses follow):</p>

				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>What is dyslexia?</i></p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Dyslexia means being smart and having a hard time learning to read.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>When you have dyslexia, will you always have it? Can it be made better?</i></p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Children who have dyslexia will always have dyslexia, but they can learn how to read. Sometimes it takes awhile for reading to get better, but it always improves a lot.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>How do you get dyslexia?</i></p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Children get dyslexia just like they get brown or green eyes or get to be short or tall—they are born with it.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Does dyslexia come from a virus?</i></p>
				<p class="list0_indent">No. Dyslexia is not catching. You cannot get it from another person.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Why is it called such a funny name like dyslexia?</i></p>
				<p class="list0_indent">The word <i>dyslexia</i> comes from the foreign (Latin) word <i>dys,</i> meaning <i>difficult,</i> and the foreign (Greek) word <i>lexia,</i> which means <i>words;</i> together the two parts add up to a <i>difficulty reading words.</i></p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Early on it is critical to help your child identify an interest or a hobby, an area in which he can have a positive experience, whether it be pure enjoyment or perhaps the ability to stand out or excel—an interest in fish or in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_308" title="308"/>rocks, a talent for baton twirling or juggling, skill in skating or swimming, a talent for acting or drawing, a propensity to understand science or computers, or a love of poetry or music. It doesn’t matter what it is. For the writer John Irving it was his involvement and skill in wrestling that helped him endure particularly harsh experiences at school. Having an interest or athletic activity often means a child’s life is not always negative or entirely about studying or catching up. It allows the child to see himself as a victor, as a competent individual who has mastery over a topic or an area; he gets to experience the feeling of winning. You must encourage him to explore a range of possibilities—in school and after school, at the Y, in sports, in music, in art, in photography—and support his participation. Not every child falls in love with an activity immediately, so it is important to expose him to different possibilities and to help get him through the initial rough spots when his first response may be to want to give up. Remember that in most areas stars are not born but made after lots of practice and hard work. Praise should not be treated as a rationed item; be giving with your praise as long as it is honestly deserved. Your child will be receiving more than his share of criticism from teachers and others. You should see to it that he knows the soothing sounds of praise.</p>
			<p class="indent">Encourage your child to view himself as a person who has something to say and whom people should respect. Discuss important decisions with him. These might involve issues that affect the entire family, like where to vacation, or issues that are more personal to him. You might talk about a current events issue, such as a national, local, or school election, or about a movie or television show. Be patient and listen as he expresses himself. Take his comments seriously and respond to them. As he gets older, there will be many occasions when he will need to speak up and advocate for himself. Getting into the habit of speaking out and being heard is invaluable preparation for that. It is important that he fully understand the nature of his reading problem and its implications, so that as he goes on in school he can determine his need for educational modifications or accommodations and feel comfortable in speaking up for himself. Role-playing with a parent or a trusted teacher or tutor can be helpful practice.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is terribly important how you as a parent view your child. If you feel that a diagnosis of dyslexia means that his future is doomed, he will come to feel the same way. Having a diagnosis of dyslexia should not preclude a child from pursuing his dreams. Given adequate intelligence, interest, persistence, and support, a child who is dyslexic can pursue virtually any area that interests <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_309" title="309"/>him. Men and women who are dyslexic have distinguished themselves in every area imaginable, including areas the uninformed might believe are not possible for a person who is dyslexic: writing, law, medicine, science, and poetry. Children who are dyslexic should not be reflexively shunted onto a path of nonacademic ambitions unless that is clearly their preference; they should at least be helped to understand that they have a much fuller range of options.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many parents of children who are dyslexic have experienced reading problems themselves. If you have, tell your child about them and about how you felt when you were growing up. Allow him to see that people whom he admires are not perfect and are able to succeed in life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Be aware that some of his behaviors, such as procrastinating with regard to reading or studying for a test, may reflect anxiety associated with previous difficulties in reading or taking tests. If these begin to interfere with his daily functioning—that is, if he always seems anxious, sad, or worried—it may be helpful to consult with a child psychiatrist or psychologist. Your pediatrician will provide you with an appropriate referral. A visit to a professional often helps you better manage a problem or prevents a more serious one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, don’t patronize a child or dumb-down his expectations. Always treat him as a person with many dimensions, not simply as a person who has a reading problem. <i>Let his strengths and not his weaknesses define him as a person.</i></p>
