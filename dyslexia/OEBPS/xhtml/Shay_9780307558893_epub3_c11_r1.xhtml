			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>SHOULD MY CHILD BE EVALUATED FOR DYSLEXIA?</b></h1>
			<p>Having described how spoken language and skilled reading develop, and how a phonologic weakness might impact each, I want to combine all the clues along with new scientific data into an early-warning system for recognizing dyslexia. This will help you answer the specific question, should my son or daughter (or I) be evaluated for dyslexia?</p>
			<p class="indent">No one wants to be an alarmist and put her child through an evaluation for trivial or transient bumps along the road to reading. Evaluations can take time, and those carried out privately can be expensive. But our children are precious, and we must always bear in mind that if a child is not evaluated and later proves to have dyslexia, we have robbed him of precious time. The human brain is resilient, but there is no question that early intervention and treatment bring about more positive change at a faster pace than an intervention provided to an older child. There is also the erosion of self-esteem that accrues over the years as a child struggles to read.</p>
			<p class="indent">Childhood is a time for learning. A child who delays breaking the phonetic code will miss much of the reading practice that is essential to building fluency. As a consequence, he will fall further and further behind his peers, begin to see himself as not belonging in school, and question his own intelligence. To see this happen to a child is sad, all the more because it is preventable.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140" title="140"/><span id="ftn-89"/>“Once children fall behind in the growth of critical word-reading skills,” says Joe Torgesen, a reading researcher who has carried out many of the critical studies on intervention, “it may require very intensive interventions to bring them back up to adequate levels of reading accuracy, and reading fluency may be even more difficult to restore because of the large amount of reading practice that is lost by children each month and year that they remain poor readers.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Most parents and teachers delay evaluating a child with reading difficulties because they believe the problems are temporary, that they will be outgrown. This is simply not true. As the participants in the Connecticut Longitudinal Study have demonstrated, <i>at least three out of four children who read poorly in third grade continue to have reading problems in high school and beyond.</i> What may seem to be tolerable and overlooked in a third-grader certainly won’t be in a high schooler or young adult. <span id="ftn-90"/>Without a specific diagnosis of dyslexia, along with proven interventions, virtually all children who have reading difficulties early on will struggle with reading when they are adults and, worse still, often feel like failures in life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Groundbreaking new longitudinal data make explicitly clear why you cannot wait or delay in having your child evaluated for dyslexia. The earlier the diagnosis, the sooner the evidence-based reading interventions can begin. These data, published in the <i>Journal of Pediatrics</i> in November 2015, demonstrate not only that most changes in reading take place from grades one to three, but that the dyslexic child is already behind by first grade. These data find that the achievement gap persists.</p>
			<p class="indent">As you can see in Figure 37 on the next page, the reading trajectories of dyslexic readers never catch up with those of typical readers. The clear takeaway is that effective reading interventions must be implemented as early as possible, when children are still developing the basics for reading acquisition, such as phonological awareness, understanding letter-sound relationships, and building a lexicon. <i>Later interventions may minimally decrease or stop the gap from widening but will not overcome the already existing differences in early grades.</i> Interventions must begin no later than first grade.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>IMPLEMENTING THE SEA OF STRENGTHS MODEL</b></h2>
			<p>
				Luckily, parents can play an active role in the early identification of a reading problem. All that is required is an observant parent who knows what she <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141" title="141"/>is looking for and who is willing to spend time listening to her child speak and read.</p>

			</figure>
			<p class="indent">The specific signs of dyslexia, both deficits and strengths, in any one individual will vary according to the age and educational level of that person. The four-year-old who can’t quite learn his letters becomes the six-year-old who can’t match sounds to letters and then the fourteen-year-old who dreads reading out loud and finally the twenty-four-year-old who reads excruciatingly slowly. The threads persist throughout a person’s life. The key is knowing how to recognize them at different periods during development.</p>
			<p class="indent">Therefore, as promised, I have gathered the clues together to provide three distinct portraits of dyslexia: first, in early childhood from the preschool period through first grade; next, in school-age children from second grade on; and last, in young adults and adults. Examine these clues carefully, think about them, and determine if any of them apply to you, your child, or someone else you are close to. Look for clues in the weaknesses <i>and</i> strengths. Identifying the weaknesses makes it possible to spot dyslexia in children before they are expected to read and in adults after they have developed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142" title="142"/>some degree of reading accuracy but when they are continuing to show the remnants of earlier problems, reading slowly and with great effort.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>CLUES TO DYSLEXIA IN EARLY CHILDHOOD</b></h2>
			<p>
				Naturally, the earliest clues involve mostly spoken language. <i>The very first clue to dyslexia may be delayed language.</i> Once your child begins to speak, look for the following problems.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent spaceabove">Parents, educators, and the dyslexic person herself may not perceive how strong her intelligence is due to the preoccupation with the impact of dyslexia in schools, where dyslexia is often neither acknowledged nor understood. Here’s what Charles Schwab has to say about how he solves problems: “I can sort of move ahead in a more radical way, to visualize what the end zone might be, where other people have to go through a sequence of various things to get there. And I know that’s frustrating to some of my cohorts here at the company. But I think in some ways that is a processing thing and so maybe I’m not burdened by this sequential thinking that so many of the people are.”</p>
			<p class="indent">If you think you or your child has some of the problems you just read about, it is important to note how frequently they manifest themselves and how many there are. You don’t need to worry about isolated clues or ones that appear very rarely. For you to be concerned, the symptoms must be persistent. Anyone can mispronounce a word now and then or confuse similar-sounding words occasionally. What you are looking for is a persistent pattern—the occurrence of a number of these symptoms over a prolonged period of time. That represents a likelihood of dyslexia.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>GETTING HELP</b></h2>
			<p>Identification of a problem is, of course, the key to getting help. The sooner a diagnosis is made, the quicker your child can get help, and the more likely you are to prevent secondary blows to her self-esteem. Here are some cautionary notes along with helpful hints to guide you as you pursue early identification of possible dyslexia in your child.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>PRESCHOOL</b></h3>
			<p>If your preschool child struggles with language, particularly with rhymes and with pronouncing words, you should not keep your worries to yourself. You need to seek help.</p>
			<p class="indent">A preschooler can be seen by her <i>general pediatrician,</i> who can consider <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149" title="149"/>her history and listen to her speak, judge her ability to appreciate rhymes and her ability to identify pictures or objects beginning with a particular sound, and then make a referral for further evaluation. Since the focus of the evaluation of such a young child is on her spoken (rather than her written) language, I often turn to a <i>speech-language pathologist</i> to carry out this type of assessment. These specialists are quite knowledgeable about early language development and are often extremely helpful in assessing phonologic skills in young children. Parents can call or visit the website of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (800-638-8255; <a href="http://www.asha.org/profind">www.asha.org/profind</a>) for the names of certified speech-language pathologists in their area.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>KINDERGARTEN</b></h3>
			<p>Parents (and teachers) must closely monitor a child’s progress in learning to read, hopefully no later than kindergarten. As I discussed earlier, a large gap between the reading of dyslexic and typical readers is already present by the end of first grade. Kindergarten is definitely a time to act.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kindergarten is in many ways a watershed in identifying children vulnerable to dyslexia. For the first time, a child is in a public environment where he is exposed to a formal curriculum geared to teaching those skills necessary for reading and he is surrounded by his peers. He is now a student, and there are expectations for what must be learned. Even acknowledging that children come from different backgrounds and may intrinsically differ in their pace of learning, the clues I have listed are important signals that reading is not progressing; they should not be ignored. The cost to your child and to you will be too great. I have yet to meet a family who feels they acted too soon.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>HELPFUL HINT:</i> If you observe these signs, I urge you to speak to your child’s teacher. Before doing so, it often helps to list your observations and your concerns. Parents are often so nervous when speaking to their child’s teacher that they forget what they want to say. The teacher will appreciate having such a list as well.</p>

			<p class="indent"><i>Don’t delay.</i> It is wishful thinking to believe there will be a sudden, magical improvement. Schools often have a tendency to want to wait, and sometimes parents have this same tendency. (<i>Why don’t we see how things go until after Thanksgiving?</i> Or, <i>We can’t spoil his Christmas.</i>) You don’t want to be like the mother of one of my patients, who was surprised to be told by her son’s teacher on the very last day of school, “I really hope he has a better year next year.”</p>

			<p class="indent">If you are unhappy after your discussion with your child’s teacher, speak to the principal or to the reading specialist (if there is one). Your concern is more likely to be taken seriously if it is expressed in writing to the school principal, along with a request for a screening and evaluation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Be persistent. Parents are often fearful of antagonizing school personnel, and justifiably so. However, the alternative—waiting—can be even more harmful to your child. Your daughter’s classroom teacher may have been worrying, too, and your interest may be just enough to jump-start the process of screening, diagnosis, and effective intervention. The most dangerous thing you can do if you suspect a reading problem is to do nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent">Under no circumstances should you allow yourself to be talked into waiting—that is not an option. Set a deadline for a response. Remember that you do not have to depend solely on your school for an evaluation. Your pediatrician can refer you for testing as well. If you would like more information, check the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity website (<a href="http://www.dyslexia.yale.edu">www.dyslexia.yale.edu</a>), the LKA Dyslexia Resource Center website (<a href="http://www.dyslexia1n5.com">www.dyslexia1n5.com</a>), the International Dyslexia Association website (<a href="https://dyslexiaida.org">https://dyslexiaida.org</a>), or the parent-based Decoding Dyslexia website (<a href="http://www.decodingdyslexia.net">www.decodingdyslexia.net</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152" title="152"/>Scottish Rite Learning Centers (a branch of Freemasonry) can be helpful, both by offering evaluations and by providing interventions, while the Neuhaus Education Center in Houston offers a range of very useful support services to both educators and parents.</p>
			<p class="indent">Don’t be intimidated. Act, and act quickly. Trust your instincts—you know your child best. With the information you have now absorbed, you are an informed parent who is an effective advocate for your child. Your child is depending on you. It is a good feeling to be in control and to know what is and what is not acceptable.</p>

			<p>Parents often ask who is capable of carrying out an informed, trustworthy, helpful examination for dyslexia and whom they should turn to for an evaluation. A major requirement is that any assessment be carried out by an individual with expertise in diagnosing dyslexia. That individual must be up-to-date on twenty-first-century scientific knowledge of dyslexia and its expression at different developmental levels from preschool through adulthood and in different contexts, including home, school, and the workplace. An evaluation is not only about administering tests; it’s about understanding dyslexia. So obtaining an in-depth history looking for the relevant signs of dyslexia across development is vitally important.</p>
			<p class="indent">Furthermore, such an evaluator should be knowledgeable about schools, have experience working with schools, understand what schools must do to support their dyslexic students, and be knowledgeable about both federal and state laws regarding dyslexia. You must ask any evaluator if he or she has diagnosed dyslexia, and how often. You will want to know what tests he or she uses to make a diagnosis. A basic test battery for dyslexia should include a test of cognitive ability (IQ); tests of reading, including real and made-up (nonsense) words; tests of reading fluency; oral reading of both single words and connected texts; tests of phonological processing; tests of vocabulary and reading comprehension; math tests, both calculation and word problems; and perhaps other tests, depending on the child’s history. I will return to this subject shortly.</p>
			<p class="indent">As I’ve said, such testing can be administered by a psychologist, a neuropsychologist, a learning-disability specialist, a reading specialist, or, especially for children under five years, a speech and language therapist. The major requirement is for the individual to have a deep understanding of dyslexia as well as training, experience with, and expertise in the measures used. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153" title="153"/>Administration of the most complex tests, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V (WISC-V) requires specific degrees, licensure, or certification.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Be aware that dyslexia can often go unrecognized even in the very best school and home circumstances.</i> The following story, Sarah’s, is about how dyslexia existed but went undetected for several years in one of the best schools in the country, with excellent, caring teachers and under the watchful eyes of highly involved, bright, doting parents who are, in fact, active in education. Sarah’s parents are sharing their story to raise your awareness, so that you will be alert to the clues, not rationalize them away, and act to have your child tested and diagnosed. Sarah’s years of struggle and self-doubt and the enduring guilt of her parents could have been avoided by early recognition and detection of signs of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sarah entered school anointed with the halo left behind by her two older brothers, ideal students, excelling in every subject. She was exceptionally bright, worked very hard, and was a pleasure to have in class. What everyone seemed to miss was that as bright as she is, Sarah is also dyslexic. In her mom’s words:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Looking back at all the things I missed, this is sort of a heartbreaking memory for me, because I consider myself an aware mom and there were all these clues before our eyes but ones that we didn’t allow ourselves to see.</p>
				<p class="indent">Because Sarah was so strong in many areas, we’d just sort of make excuses for her. There was this paradox: She was very slow to learn to read and yet she was great at memorizing—she memorized everything. And so it went for the first several years of school. Sarah worked very hard. For example, even as far back as kindergarten, at parent events where children got up on a stage and read aloud, you would not know Sarah had any problem in reading. She stood up and read to all the other kids and the parents.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Unknown to everyone listening was that Sarah had memorized everything. “And so she would do these very good readings and I thought we were right where we were supposed to be and she compensated for many, many years.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sarah was not only keeping her reading difficulty from her parents and teachers but struggling emotionally, keeping this from herself as well. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" title="154"/>result was many requests to stay home and avoid going to school. I have heard this now from so many parents that I think frequent school avoidance should set off some alarms. Be wary of a child’s repeated pattern of complaining of being ill and asking to stay home when she appears quite well, with no fever or overt signs of illness. If the child is sent to school and you receive frequent calls from the school nurse that the child claims to feel sick but doesn’t show any signs, you should also be wary. Repeated pleas to remain at or return home are a sign of the child’s overwhelming anxiety. Although her parents couldn’t understand “how someone this smart was having this much trouble,” Sarah knew. In fact, she reached a point of concern when she noticed that her classmates who were always part of her academic group doing comparable work were now ahead of her and that “something was wrong.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally Sarah said, “I think I need to see Pearl. There’s something that’s not right.” (Pearl, who performed evaluations for possible learning difficulties, was Sarah’s step-grandmother.) Indeed, something was not right. Results showed a large discrepancy between Sarah’s high intelligence, in the ninety-fifth percentile, and her reading skills, at only the twentieth percentile. Without any question Sarah had a glaring, unexpected difficulty in reading, and yet neither her parents nor her school had picked up on it. During the first three years of school, reading consists of relatively few words and much repetition of the same words, and that is convenient for memorization. But from fourth grade up there are many more words and less repetition, making memorization much more difficult to accomplish.</p>
			<p class="indent">Schools and parents must raise their antennae not to overlook students like Sarah, who despite significant reading difficulties force themselves to work, work, and work some more, so that homework begins when the child arrives home from school and goes on well into the night. This pattern results in major spillover into other aspects of the child’s life, so that there is little, or often no, time for socializing or participating in sports or other after-school activities.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sarah’s parents were overwhelmed with guilt because they had missed so many clues, and then they saw how much difference it made for their daughter to know she was dyslexic. As her dad describes the transformation following her diagnosis in ninth grade, “It was like the weight of the world came off Sarah’s shoulders. And once we knew, we all jumped into action with her and with the school.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I should have acted sooner on things that were right there,” says Sarah’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155" title="155"/>mom. “I think, too, it’s not stopping but going to the next step. For example, asking the teacher the next question when he said she needs a tutor, going to the next step and asking if Sarah should be tested to determine the source of her difficulty.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Happily, Sarah’s parents have much to say on all the positive things that have come with Sarah’s identification as dyslexic.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>What started to pick Sarah up off the floor is the idea that she can manage this. Once her dyslexia was diagnosed she took charge of it.</p>
				<p class="indent">We missed it, but what I would say to parents is don’t be afraid of it. Become empathetic, learn about it, do the best you can to help your kid understand, also, that they’re going to be fine. This isn’t the end of the world.</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>Not only is it not the end of the world, it’s a great opportunity.</i> Sarah in high school had to learn not only how to strategize for herself but also how to advocate for herself, which is good—a lot of kids get through high school without ever having to really take charge of where they are in the whole system. She would talk to teachers. She would explain—if her friends asked why she was staying later—and so she had to do all of this. So she was ahead of the game, I think, in learning how to take care of herself. And when she applied to college, she wasn’t even going to apply to very competitive ones. She was afraid she was not smart enough to get in. And then she decided to do it and she got in. She didn’t want to put herself in a situation where she was not successful. It takes her longer to do her work—she’s spending all this time in the library—but she’s doing it.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Her mother smiled as she told me: “But she’s doing it and she’s doing wonderfully.” Sarah’s proud dad added, “She has grit and resilience in addition to a brilliant mind. I think back at how many times Sarah would have to tell the teacher, ‘I need a half hour more. You have to give me a half hour more.’ She would have to do that for herself. Clearly, that’s the kind of resilience many people never learn.”</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>HELPFUL HINT:</i> Parents, too, have to think of ways to make the days go better. Here, as well, Sarah’s mom worked out a plan to focus her on the positive.</p>
				<p class="spaceabove"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156" title="156"/>Every day in fifth grade I’d pick Sarah up and she was just like mopey and depressed and upset. And she’d get in the car and I said, “Okay, the first three things out of your mouth now are what went well today.” Then she had to worry about that and focus on it during the day and that just got her through—it’s like one of my brilliant moments.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Now that you are aware of the warning signals and the urgent need to obtain an evaluation for dyslexia, I want to tell you about the evaluation itself: how we go about making a diagnosis of dyslexia.</p>
