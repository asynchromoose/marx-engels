			<p>Above all else, parents and teachers of a dyslexic child must know that he can be taught to read, though it is not easy and may take some time. But it is happening more and more. Your child’s becoming a reader should be your expectation, and your child must be made to know this, too. At the same time, most often for a dyslexic child learning to read is not a sprint but a marathon. Like a marathon, the reward at the finish line is profound relief matched with a strong, newfound sense of empowerment, a feeling for the child that he can conquer any obstacle. I have witnessed scores of hardworking, bright, dyslexic young men and women transform into readers who turn to books and magazines for pleasure, who are not put off by reading materials that are part of their work, and who continue on to the highest levels of education and succeed in their careers and professions—and in life.</p>
			<p class="indent">The approach I recommend for teaching a child with dyslexia to read follows naturally from what I have already discussed. The approach is consistent with the template I described earlier for teaching children to break the reading code, so please forgive the repetition. All children must master the same elements of reading.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-142"/>The first two elements, phonemic awareness and phonics, are often grouped together as alphabetics, and there is extensive scientific support for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_286" title="286"/>the critical role they play in early reading. The process of mastering each of these steps is much more difficult for the dyslexic reader. The principles are the same. For the dyslexic child, the approaches must be</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>TEACHING THE VERY YOUNG CHILD AT-RISK FOR DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>By now you don’t need me to tell you that as a parent you cannot and should not wait to identify dyslexia in your son or daughter. Simple, efficient, reliable screening measures (for example, the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™) are now available that will identify at-risk children in kindergarten and first, second, and third grades.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Prereading to Early Reading Programs.</i> <span id="ftn-143"/>For children in preschool or those in kindergarten who are screened and identified as at-risk, parents can consider several commercial programs, including Headsprout, Ooka Island, and Lexia Core5 Reading (which I described previously; see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page_216">this page</a>).</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Connected Text—Reading Decodable Texts.</i> It is not enough to teach a child the elements of phonemic awareness and phonics. What is important for typical readers is even more essential for those readers who are dyslexic. It is critical that <i>simultaneously with being taught these elements children begin to read connected text.</i> For the child at-risk for dyslexia, it is best for the connected text initially to be in the form of controlled vocabulary words that the child has already mastered. As you now know, these texts are referred to as “decodable texts” (containing the words with letter-sound patterns that a child has already been taught) and now also as Readables (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page_218">this page</a>). These books can help him apply his newfound skills by actually reading words in a story. The Bob Books series and Geodes are good examples (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page_218">this page</a>). Reflecting their importance in encouraging reading in dyslexic boys and girls, I want to draw your attention to these and other decodable texts, among them S.P.I.R.E. Decodable Readers (EPS Publishers) and Scholastic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_287" title="287"/>Decodable Readers (Scholastic). These reading series provide increasingly complex reading material in a very user-friendly format, incorporating both fiction and nonfiction. Alternatively, parents and children can have fun in creating their own personal minibooks. It takes little more than keeping a list of the words your son or daughter has learned and combining them into very simple sentences. (“Pat the cat. The hat is on the cat.”) As the child learns new words, you can keep adding to the series, thereby showing your child how much he has learned. Then he has his very own library to call upon when he wants to “read” a book. Generally these little books are most helpful in kindergarten and early first grade. Other strategies I discussed earlier are also used, including teaching sight words (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c18_r1.xhtml#page_245">this page</a> for a list of the most common sight words), writing letters, and spelling.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>TEACHING THE SCHOOL-AGE CHILD WITH DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>For the older child diagnosed with dyslexia, programs referred to by the WWC as “Phonological Awareness Plus Letter Knowledge Training” are effective. Common threads run through all these programs. They follow the same template I described earlier for teaching children to break the reading code.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>ALPHABETICS</b></h3>
			<p><span id="ftn-144"/>As I noted earlier, phonemic awareness and phonics are often grouped together as alphabetics, and there is extensive scientific support for the critical role they play in early reading. While many commercially available programs contain elements of these components, few provide enough scientific evidence to meet the rigorous standards developed by What Works Clearinghouse or the <i>strong or moderate</i> evidence in the guidelines in the Every Student Succeeds Act. Below I have reviewed some examples of programs that meet What Works Clearinghouse standards for effectiveness. I want to emphasize that these are just some examples. What Works Clearinghouse lists other programs that are effective and is constantly updating its roster of programs. There may be other programs that will prove effective, but at the time of this writing there is not enough evidence to declare them unequivocally effective.</p>
			<p class="indent">You may have heard reading programs referred to generically as Orton-Gillingham, a tutorial approach developed for struggling readers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_288" title="288"/>over seven decades ago by Samuel Orton, M.D., a neuropsychiatrist, and three teachers with whom he worked, Anna Gillingham, Bessie Stillman, and Beth Slingerland. It is typically taught one-to-one or in small groups. Orton-Gillingham focuses on phonemic awareness and phonics embedded within a highly structured and systematic framework that tries to engage all the senses in learning about letters and sounds. This multisensory approach embodies auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements. For example, a child taps each finger to his thumb as he sounds out a word. Orton-Gillingham is conceptualized as an <i>approach</i> with many features or principles, and many commercially available programs, including the ones listed below, use components of the Orton-Gillingham approach. At this time there is no concrete evidence that multisensory strategies significantly improve reading, though in the future evidence may emerge.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Wilson Reading System is a structured literacy program based on phonological-coding research and Orton-Gillingham principles designed for children in grades two and above. Children meet with a teacher for sixty to ninety minutes two to five times a week, individually or in a small group (up to six students) for forty-five to ninety minutes daily. A new version of the Wilson Reading System (WRS4) released in early 2018 represents a major step forward by having students begin reading connected text at the very first lesson. This represents a breakthrough for dyslexic students and places them on the path to becoming readers who not only decode well but who read fluently and with good comprehension. The Wilson program provides students with many rules and may be especially appealing to brighter students who are highly verbal. In addition to the structure and content of the program itself, what is particularly outstanding about Wilson is the range and degree of support provided to educators teaching the program. Training for teachers begins with a ninety-hour online certification course, which includes just about everything a teacher would want to know about implementing the program, including information about the structure of language, how to use curriculum materials with students, how to plan lessons, and how to make sure that each of the components of teaching reading is covered. In addition, teachers are required to carry out a supervised practicum for at least sixty lessons with a student. Each lesson is planned individually—there are no preplanned lessons, but there is a standard lesson outline that the teacher fills in for each student. Progress monitoring and assessment are built into every lesson. Students need to meet criteria for automaticity and fluency before they can move on to the next subset. <span id="ftn-145"/>Certified Wilson instructors are required to participate in an extensive professional development program. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_289" title="289"/>According to What Works Clearinghouse, this system produces significant positive effects on alphabetics.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fundations, a version of Wilson available for students in kindergarten through third grade, is designed to be used with a core literature-based language arts program for an integrated and comprehensive approach to reading and spelling. Fundations provides all students in kindergarten through grade three classrooms with a systematic program in the foundational skills for reading and spelling, emphasizing the basics of reading, including phonemic awareness, phonics-word study, high-frequency word study, fluency, vocabulary, handwriting, and spelling. Fundations is used both as a supplemental whole-class thirty-minute daily teaching program and for at-risk students in a small group for an additional thirty minutes three to five times per week.</p>
			<p class="indent">I have focused particularly on the Wilson Reading System because it contains many of the elements, in terms of both content and presentation, that along with teaching-related materials, provide an exemplar of a well-thought-out evidence-based instructional program for the dyslexic reader.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another program based on Orton-Gillingham principles is SpellRead, a small-group program for dyslexic readers in grades two to twelve. The program focuses on developing the child’s ability to automatically identify the sounds of increasingly complex letter combinations and then to effortlessly apply this knowledge to reading and spelling words. The program has positive effects on alphabetics and potentially positive effects on fluency and comprehension.</p>
			<p class="indent">READ 180 was found by What Works Clearinghouse to have potentially positive effects on comprehension and general literacy achievement in children in grades four through nine. The typical program is ninety minutes long and consists of whole-group and small-group direct instruction. The goal of READ 180 is to address gaps in students’ skills through the use of a computer program, literature, and direct instruction in reading skills.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Lindamood Phoneme Sequencing (LiPS) program also uses Orton-Gillingham principles, but in contrast to programs that teach children to focus on how the word <i>looks,</i> it encourages children to learn about how the specific sounds are articulated and how each sound <i>feels</i>—that is, to learn the <i>oral motor</i> characteristics of individual speech sounds. Subsequent activities then focus on direct instruction in letter patterns, sight words, and context clues in reading. What Works Clearinghouse found LiPS to be effective in teaching alphabetics and reading fluency.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sound Partners, a phonics-based tutoring program that provides supplemental <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_290" title="290"/>reading instruction for kindergarten through grade three, is credited by What Works Clearinghouse as having positive effects on alphabetics, fluency, and comprehension.</p>
			<p class="indent">Success for All (SFA), developed by Robert Slavin and Nancy Madden at Johns Hopkins University, was rated by What Works Clearinghouse to be an effective ninety-minute-a-day, whole-school reform model for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, comprehension, and general reading achievement.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the computer interactive category there is Read Naturally, a program that aims to improve reading fluency and uses a combination of texts, audio, and computer software. What Works Clearinghouse says that there are “potentially positive effects with Read Naturally on general reading achievement, mixed effects in reading fluency, and no discernable effects on alphabetics and comprehension for beginning readers.” Newer studies may provide additional information.</p>
			<p class="indent">Read, Write &amp; Type! is a software program developed for students six to nine years of age. What Works Clearinghouse found it to be effective in teaching beginning readers phonemic awareness and phonics through typing the words.</p>
			<p class="indent">You will hear many claims of the superiority of one program over another, but in fact all the evidence-based programs have been shown to be effective. Other variables to be considered include teacher training, availability of materials, and, most importantly, <i>time included for teacher training</i> and <i>time provided by the child’s school to fully implement the program.</i> The Wilson Reading System is designed to be completed in two to three years according to the minutes per day designated for both one-on-one and small-group lessons. This program, and indeed all other evidence-based reading programs, must be implemented as they were designed to be and should not be abbreviated, either for the time spent each day or for the duration of the program.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>A WORD ABOUT RTI</b></h3>
			<p>
				Response to Intervention (RTI) was written into the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c33_r1.xhtml#page_468">this page</a> for a detailed discussion) and has been adopted by the majority of school systems in the United States. RTI provides a range of assessment, instruction, and interventions within a tiered system offering different reading interventions depending on the child’s level of reading difficulty. Concerns about the <span id="ftn-146"/>“unappreciated paucity of empirical support for RTI and an overly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_291" title="291"/>optimistic view of its practical, problematic issues” were raised as early as 2009, especially on the “potential negative long-term impact on students with disabilities.” In fact, a very large-scale study of RTI proved that these concerns were valid, and as a headline in <i>Education Week</i> said, “RTI Practice Falls Short of Promise, First Graders Who Were Identified for More Help Fell Further Behind.” <span id="ftn-147"/>The article highlighted the results of a large federal study released in 2015 which indicated that first-grade children who received reading interventions via an RTI framework actually read less well than their virtually identical peers who did not participate in RTI. It is not clear whether the many school districts using an RTI framework will try to find more effective approaches or will simply ignore the evidence. The original intent of RTI was to serve students with relatively mild learning problems. However, currently RTI is being used to serve children who are often severely dyslexic and who, after typically six weeks or so of instruction, are funneled back into their regular classrooms, unremediated and, sadly, destined to fail.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>OTHER INFLUENTIAL FACTORS</b></h3>
			<p>As I mentioned earlier, in addition to the reading program, there are other important factors that can significantly influence your child’s eventual success in reading and in life, including the school environment (especially the school’s understanding of dyslexia), the intrinsic qualities of the child, and the significant adults who interact with him.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, the presence, severity, and effectiveness of approaches to any associated conditions, including anxiety and ADHD, will affect his future. Especially important is ongoing support and encouragement of a champion, whether it be a parent, a grandparent, or a teacher. As you will read later, through real-life examples of highly successful dyslexic men and women, the magical ingredient is often such a champion, who provides support for both the child’s spirit and his reading. Such a champion is vigilant in ensuring that the child is screened early, diagnosed, and receives the necessary instruction, at the same time nurturing the child’s self-esteem, pointing out his strengths and encouraging him to pursue his interests. The champion is often the key to giving the child hope so he can envision a bright future.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-148"/>It is important that the child’s progress be monitored and tracked using standardized progress-monitoring tools such as aimsweb and DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills). The aimsweb Reading Curriculum-Based Measurement (R-CBM) is a brief, individually administered, standardized test of oral reading fluency designed to be used <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_292" title="292"/>for progress monitoring from the beginning of first grade through eighth grade. DIBELS Next, the most recent iteration of DIBELS, is very similar to aimsweb, providing a measure of oral reading fluency from the middle of first grade through sixth grade. Each provides short passages at the child’s reading level which the child reads aloud for one minute as accurately and quickly as he can; scores are reported as correct words read per minute (CWPM). Both aimsweb and DIBELS Next are typically assessed at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. If a child performs well, three assessments are adequate. If not, each can be administered more frequently to monitor progress and to make any necessary instructional refinements.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-149"/>I am proud to say that the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ has been a game-changer in making possible the identification of children as early as kindergarten, first grade, second grade, or third grade as at-risk for dyslexia. I am referring again to the screener here because for boys and girls who are dyslexic, the cost of not being identified by schools is alarming and, I believe, unethical. As you know, schools identify about 4 percent as dyslexic, when the actual number is 20 percent. Many of these overlooked boys and girls see others learning to read, and so begins a downward spiral in feeling that they are not bright and that they can’t read, which evolves into feeling that school is not for them. This tragedy is preventable. This may well be the most important action that can significantly benefit a dyslexic child’s future. Parents should demand that schools screen children early.</p>
			<p class="indent">I receive a great many requests for information about programs teaching phonemic awareness and phonics, and that is why I am emphasizing throughout this book that teachers and parents have many available choices, including the aforementioned Lexia, Ooka Island, and Headsprout. Additional programs many have found useful in teaching the elements of phonological awareness include <i>Phonemic Awareness in Young Children</i> and Siegfried Engelmann’s <i>Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Good evidence indicates that beginning teaching phonics in kindergarten or first grade produces the best results. It is not only important to teach phonics, it is incredibly important for struggling readers to have opportunities to <i>listen</i> to books that spark their interest, books that they will look forward to hearing over and over again. I have enjoyed watching as little Ari and Eva reach for a favorite book, curl up, and smile as each listens to familiar stories and then slowly begins to sound out simple words such as <i>hop</i> and <i>pop.</i> As the child listens and reads aloud more and more, the words come sliding out more quickly and smoothly. What joy a child experiences as he discovers he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_293" title="293"/>can read many of the words on the page and he is encouraged to keep trying to decipher others. It isn’t easy, but he can do it, bit by bit.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>MOVING FROM ACCURACY TO FLUENCY</b></h2>
			<p>As you are aware, fluency is a major, critical factor facilitating reading comprehension. Reflecting its great importance, especially to a dyslexic child, I will emphasize once again the key factors to keep in mind when teaching fluency. These are to practice oral reading, practice reading connected text over and over again, and provide ongoing feedback as the child reads.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-150"/>Recent research emphasizes the importance of fluent reading of connected text, in contrast to fluent reading of isolated words, as an important element in the development of reading comprehension. Reading connected text should not be delayed, for this is what reading is all about: getting to meaning. By seeing the same word in different contexts, the child realizes that the same word he sees on the page may have several specific meanings, depending on the surrounding words or paragraph. Reading connected text increases a child’s vocabulary and background knowledge, two critical factors influencing comprehension.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is important to use a reading intervention program that rapidly gets the child into decodable texts—an entry into reading for meaning—just as soon as the child starts to learn decoding. It is critical that the child read aloud to a teacher, parent, or tutor who thoughtfully and gently provides feedback.</p>
			<p class="indent">Much has been learned about how best to implement repeated oral reading programs. Repeated reading of old materials and reading new materials both have a positive influence on word recognition and reading fluency. A child’s reading comprehension, however, profits most when he reads new materials. Simply listening to a teacher read a story does not improve word recognition, fluency, or comprehension. <span id="ftn-151"/>“While reading aloud to students is important in fostering a love of reading, learners must actively engage in the reading of connected text if they are to become skilled readers.” Dyslexic readers will both enjoy and benefit from reading books referred to as high interest, low readability (see the Appendix).</p>
			<p class="indent">If your child hates to read and doesn’t read very well, regularly reading aloud with him will quickly alert you to a problem if one exists. A child who avoids reading is among those most in need of practice and guidance and is especially helped by your reading aloud with him and your helpful <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_294" title="294"/>feedback. That will avoid a common downward spiral often observed in dyslexic readers: such children will avoid reading, and as a result they never receive practice or the helpful feedback and correction that will improve their reading. Children who become less involved with reading fall further and further behind their classmates. They never build the fast-paced neural circuits necessary for rapid and automatic word recognition. Even with the most reluctant reader, it is possible to find books that are comfortable—and interesting—to read aloud with you. The most pressing goal is to practice reading the printed word aloud and not to teach literature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reading should always be encouraged for pleasure and for knowledge. However, <i>if a child is a halting or tenuous reader, simply encouraging him to read silently to himself will not make him a better reader.</i> He may simply be repeating errors—or daydreaming. It is only by reading aloud, with feedback and correction, that real gains in reading are noted.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is important to find enjoyable ways to encourage reading aloud. Having a child practice reading poetry is an excellent method for improving his fluency. Poems are usually short, they have rhyme, and they are tailor-made for reading quickly and with expression. Some teachers stage a “poetry party.” The children select a poem and for the next several days practice reading the poem aloud again and again. The day of the party, lights are turned out and flashlights or lamps provide dim light and atmosphere. <span id="ftn-152"/>After sufficient practice, even the most disabled readers seem to be able to read their poems with accuracy, smoothness, and expression in this environment. (See the Appendix for recommended books of poetry.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, many students enjoy and benefit from staging dramatic readings of a selection from a script. They enjoy the drama and are willing participants. Dramatic readings truly improve fluency. In one recent study students participating in this approach, called Reader’s Theatre, for just a ten-week period made an entire year’s gain in improving their reading rates. Students can face an audience or simply sit in a circle and read from a script. Readers Theatre is successful with children beginning as early as second grade and continuing through high school.</p>
			<p class="indent">Students also enjoy reading and rereading (or singing) songs or limericks. Lyrics to a song can be handed out to a class or to a small group and the song can be read or sung for several days in a row. Song lyrics are particularly suitable for choral reading, where the teacher first reads the words and then she and the students join together to read along as a group, rereading the lyrics four or more times.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_295" title="295"/>Older dyslexic students serve as wonderful reading tutors for younger students. Each student benefits from reading aloud; in addition, the dyslexic student gains a rare sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from being able to help someone read.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>At Home.</i> Parents of dyslexic readers can also help to improve their child’s fluency. In Professor Tim Razinski’s reading clinic at Kent State University, parents participate with their child in a method that I mentioned earlier called <i>paired reading,</i> a variation of repeated oral reading. It requires only fifteen minutes an evening. Parents read a brief story or passage to their child, both parent and child then read the same passage together a few times, and then the child alone reads the text back to his parent. <span id="ftn-153"/>Comparisons showed that children who read aloud with their parents made substantially larger gains in fluency than those who didn’t.</p>
			<p class="indent">I urge parents of dyslexic children to make fluency training—repeated oral reading—their number-one priority. Because it involves reinforcement rather than teaching a child a new concept, it is ideally suited for the home. Fluency training is something all parents can do for their child—it requires little time and minimal expertise, and it invariably works. You are training your child’s brain and helping build the accurate neural models necessary for quick and accurate reading. There are very few activities for a dyslexic reader that provide as much improvement for the amount of time spent as guided repeated oral reading does.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>HELPING OLDER CHILDREN BECOME MORE FLUENT</b></h3>
			<p>Fortunately, it is not too late for older dyslexic students to benefit from carefully targeted fluency practice. The same principles I described for younger children apply, only adapted to the needs and interests of older students. Reading passages aloud is helpful to students of all ages, but older students have difficulty finding suitable materials to read aloud. Older students can make use of the Lexile and DRP systems for help in choosing interesting books at their reading level. Whatever the material, students should practice reading aloud passages that are relatively short, preferably less than two hundred words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Older students also benefit from reading single words aloud, especially so-called irregular words. Around the fourth grade there is a tremendous surge in the proportion of words that are irregular—those that do not follow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_296" title="296"/>the regular rules for pronunciation and do not lend themselves to sounding out. Unless a child who is dyslexic is provided with specific practice targeted to these words (words such as <i>bough</i> and <i>though</i>), she will suffer a setback. The sudden onslaught of such hard-to-decipher words may be one factor behind the well-known dip in reading performance that seems to occur around the fourth grade, colloquially referred to as “the fourth-grade slump.” Fortunately, more and more reading programs that are effective for older dyslexic readers are incorporating fluency exercises with these irregular words. For example, words such as <i>canoe, courage, promise,</i> and <i>bouquet</i> are likely to be found in reading materials meant for students in higher grades but must be learned through repeated practice as part of fluency exercises. The word lists obtained from Oxton House Publishers (<a href="http://www.oxtonhouse.com">http://www.oxtonhouse.com</a>) include more than one hundred irregular words.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some older children may gain the most from practicing relevant words—words they will need in order to pursue their studies. I recommend that they practice reading aloud words taken from their reading materials in different subjects, such as social studies and science. These words can be put on index cards or on the computer (for example, Quizlet) for practice reading aloud. Without such supports, assigning a dyslexic student reading in a textbook may lead only to frustration and disappointment.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Measuring Fluency.</i> Almost as important as teaching and practicing fluency is measuring it. There are useful guidelines to help you judge a child’s fluency relative to others his age. For children in lower grades, the expected fluency rates for oral reading of passages are</p>
			<table class="tbl1">
				<tr>

			</table>
			<p>These rates are approximations. Both aimsweb and DIBELS Next have taken the next step and set specific thresholds for oral fluency rates in the early grades.</p>
			<p class="indent">As important as measuring a child’s fluency rate is tracking his improvement on a simple graph, at least weekly, as he continues to practice. Both <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_297" title="297"/>aimsweb and DIBELS Next are very useful in monitoring progress. Keep in mind, too, that a child’s rate of reading growth follows a distinct pattern: Growth is greatest in the early school years and diminishes with each succeeding grade. Growth is most often at its maximum at the beginning of each school year and tapers off toward spring.</p>
			<p class="indent">All children do not respond in exactly the same manner to a program. Most important is the trajectory. A relatively flat line indicating little progress loudly proclaims the need for a change, just as a steep upward incline proudly trumpets progress. Happily, reading programs like those I have recommended and increased scientific understanding join together to make reading fluency more approachable.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> In reading about fluency, here and elsewhere, rate and speed of reading are frequently mentioned. These are important parameters, but I cannot emphasize enough that you must remember that the most critical factor in fluency is <i>understanding—getting to the meaning of what has just been read.</i> This is what is inferred by the word <i>prosody</i> in the definition of fluency. When you listen to a child practice reading aloud, he should be reading with prosody: inflection, speed, and tone reflecting the meaning of what he has read. His reading should not be flat or monotonic, as if he were reading an unknown language. If it is, he is not reading fluently. When a child is practicing reading aloud, listen carefully for intonation and ask him relevant questions to help ensure he is reading fluently—with meaning.</p>

			<p><i>Additional Aspects of Fluency.</i> Lack of fluency in reading is often accompanied by lack of fluency in speaking, that is, difficulty in quickly retrieving words when called upon in class to explain or describe a topic. Many of my students have found it extremely helpful to spend part of their study-hall time working individually with a teacher (or at home with a tutor), reading and then talking through the content of an assignment. Speaking and using the specific vocabulary relevant to a subject often functions to lubricate a student’s retrieval processes and enables him to access exactly what he wants to say more readily. Previewing, reviewing, and talking through are critically important for the dyslexic child if he is to participate in the class and discussion periods more fully.</p>

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_298" title="298"/><i>Building Vocabulary.</i> For dyslexic children it is especially critical to build a large reservoir of vocabulary words, so that even if the child’s ability to decode words is weak, her extensive vocabulary will enable her to figure out the word. <span id="ftn-154"/>I earlier detailed Isabel Beck’s three-tier framework for systematically building vocabulary. You will recall that Tier 1 words reflect very common words used in everyday conversations; Tier 2 words are those likely to be found in books and are extremely useful to all readers, especially the up-and-coming reader; Tier 3 words are specialized words and terms that are more often used in specialized disciplines. It is Tier 2 words that have the greatest utility and that logically form the focus of effective vocabulary instruction. It is important to keep in mind that the major focus in teaching vocabulary should be on the <i>idea</i> that the word represents, even to the point of beginning any discussion with the idea rather than the definition of a word.</p>
			<p class="indent">Both teachers and parents need to be selective about which Tier 2 words a child is expected to learn. While there is no perfect way of selecting which words to prioritize, a useful approach is to focus on those words most likely to stretch the child’s mind—those that are conceptually difficult (but not beyond his grasp)—and that he would not likely get on his own. Above all, a word should be relevant and useful. For example, you can preread an assigned book and select specific words for intensive vocabulary instruction. A child can also suggest words that give him a hard time. A word chosen for vocabulary instruction should tie into a central concept of a story or topic the child is learning. It often works best to focus on a group of words unified by a common theme or topic, so that learning each individual word reinforces learning the other words in the group as well. Words that relate to that common theme but have opposite meanings also work well.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, in one approach the theme was “fear.” The teacher and her students contributed to generating a word list based on fear, writing each of the words on the board. When a large number of words accumulated, the words were subdivided into categories. Students were encouraged to think of words that conveyed not being fearful—words such as <i>intrepid, heroic,</i> and <i>brave.</i> In this brainstorming method, several other categories were developed as well:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p class="hanging0"><i>Emotions/reactions:</i> terror, horror, fainting, quaking</p>
				<p class="hanging0"><i>People/creatures:</i> monster, ghost, bogeyman, alien, humanoid, poltergeist, Dracula</p>
				<p class="hanging0"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_299" title="299"/><i>Places:</i> cemetery, graveyard, haunted house, funeral parlor, unlit street, dark alley.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">In the process of generating these words, children engage in far-ranging discussions of their own experiences relating to fear, activating their background knowledge and relating it to the current book the class is reading. An important by-product of this activity is that the children have enriched and extended their understanding of fear. They now possess a new arsenal of words. The very act of forming categories for these words has given structure and direction in how to think about words and their potential meanings.</p>
			<p class="indent">For dyslexic readers, who benefit from more practice and more reinforcement, computer programs are helpful in supplementing vocabulary instruction. Several Internet resources are very helpful in supporting vocabulary development; see, for example, <a href="http://vocabularyandspellingcity.com">vocabularyandspellingcity.com</a> and <a href="http://vocabulary.com">vocabulary.com</a>.</p>

			<p><i>Comprehension: The Goal of Reading.</i> Never lose sight of the major goal of reading: to comprehend what the author of the text is communicating to the reader. To emphasize once again, reading comprehension is the result of a complex interplay of the child’s decoding skills and reading fluency in combination with her vocabulary, background knowledge, and reasoning ability. As important as comprehension is to all readers, it is especially important <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_300" title="300"/>to boys and girls who are dyslexic. Happily, this is an area that dyslexics typically master. As I emphasized early on, though dyslexics have problems decoding and reading slowly, these problems can be thought of as circumscribed and surrounded by a sea of strengths in higher cognitive processes such as reasoning, concept formation, critical thinking, and <i>comprehension</i> (see Figure 12, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page_56">this page</a>). Comprehension deficits are not and should not be included in the state-of-the-art definition of dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Comprehension is an area dyslexics can and often do excel in. To most fully develop the dyslexic student’s strong potential in this critical area, it is important to gain an understanding of exactly what comprehension is, along with the known paths leading to high levels of comprehension. Comprehension is often thought of as the process of making connections between new information in the text and the known information the reader brings. Rather than literal comprehension being the major focus of instruction, it is the <i>inferential</i> and <i>critical</i> levels of comprehension that should be emphasized more and more. Here the child uses her own background knowledge, vocabulary, and reasoning skills to grasp the meaning of what she has just read. The basic idea is</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>DYSLEXIA AND COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS (CCSS)</b></h2>
			<p>
				CCSS expects second-graders to read and comprehend complex expository, informational literature at the second- and third-grade levels proficiently by the end of the year. As you might expect, such an expectation significantly impacts dyslexic students, the vast majority of whom are not reading proficiently by the end of second grade. What has become abundantly clear is that the CCSS and accompanying tests such as Partnership for Assessment of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_301" title="301"/>Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), and tests developed by individual states based on the CCSS (all designed to assess whether students are meeting the CCSS) are totally inappropriate for students with dyslexia. Such tests are based on the mistaken belief that all students, including dyslexic students, will be fluent readers by the end of second grade and that all students should read at grade level and above, an expectation that clearly ignores all that has been learned about the development of reading in dyslexic children. Furthermore, CCSS is predicated on comprehension-focused reading instruction using “complex text” as its basis, ignoring whether dyslexic students can actually read those words. If this were not serious enough, tests such as the PARCC, SBAC, and other tests based on the same presumptions have the pernicious effect of encouraging schools to eliminate or drop all other reading instruction, including the much-needed decoding instruction for dyslexic students. The CCSS is wholly inappropriate for children in very early grades, especially dyslexic students, who are invariably still struggling with and working hard to master decoding. Later on I will discuss how the GED test for adults is now based on the Common Core test and may actually be harming hardworking adult dyslexic readers.</p>

			<p><i>What About Writing?</i> For the dyslexic student, direct, explicit instruction is critical for the development of good writing skills. One very effective writing program for dyslexic students is found in the aforementioned <i>Teaching Basic Writing Skills</i> by Judith Hochman, developed at the Windward School in White Plains, New York. For Hochman, <span id="ftn-156"/>“The two primary goals of this program are to raise the linguistic complexity of students’ sentences and to improve the organization of their compositions.” This is accomplished by systematically presenting goals, strategies, and activities for writing sentences, paragraphs, and compositions. Starting with sentences, the program teaches students to distinguish between sentences and sentence fragments, to sequence words correctly in scrambled sentences, to use coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, to add and move phrases and clauses within sentences, to combine multiple sentences into one, to expand sentences, and to summarize. Once the student has mastered sentences, the program advances to paragraphs and compositions, teaching students to write a topic sentence, then organize several additional sentences into a cohesive paragraph. In this component of the program, students first learn <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_302" title="302"/>to develop a quick outline and write a draft based on it. During the revising and editing process, students are taught to use transition words and to practice writing introductions and conclusions. Hochman notes that “although spelling, handwriting and related skills are important, students should be encouraged to focus on developing the higher-level skills they need to write.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Professors Steven Graham and Karen Harris at Arizona State University emphasize the importance of students’ learning to use word processing in the writing process: “Many schools still use 19th century writing tools such as pencil and paper, even though scientific studies demonstrate that students in grades 1 to 12 show greater improvement in their writing over time when they use word processing to write at school versus writing by hand…. We obviously need to move writing instruction more squarely into the 21st century, making it possible for our students to take advantage of word processing and other electronic methods for composing.”</p>

			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Accommodations: The Next Step.</i> As the child progresses in school and reaches middle school and then high school—particularly any child who has the potential to participate in demanding academic programs—the focus expands to ensuring that necessary accommodations are provided. This is important because it places emphasis not only on the child’s reading difficulty but on his strengths. It reminds everyone that the isolated phonologic weakness is only one small part of a much larger picture. Far too often the focus is only on the weakness, and the child’s strong capabilities (and potential) are overlooked. Whatever those strengths are—the ability to reason, to analyze, to conceptualize, to be creative, to have empathy, to visualize, to imagine, or to think in novel ways—it is imperative that they be identified, nurtured, and allowed to define that child. For many dyslexic children, accommodations represent the difference between academic success and failure, between having a test result reflect their ability versus being penalized for slow reading, between a growing sense of self-confidence and an enduring sense of defeat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Perhaps the most important accommodation is the provision of extra time on assignments and examinations. Dyslexics’ slow reading persists into young adulthood and beyond. One important consequence is that even though dyslexic readers are often very bright and have excellent verbal intelligence, they will appear not to comprehend printed materials unless they are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_303" title="303"/>given additional time to carry out the reading. This means that for a dyslexic to demonstrate his true understanding of written material, whether it be a homework assignment or an exam, he must be provided with additional time. Unless a dyslexic is allowed that time, his grade will be a measure of his disability rather than a measure of his ability. That’s not fair.</p>
