			<p>In this law, dyslexia is defined:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament">(1) </span>DYSLEXIA.—The term “dyslexia” means an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader, most commonly caused by a difficulty in the phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament">(2) </span>DYSLEXIA SCREENING PROGRAM.—The term “dyslexia screening program” means a screening program for dyslexia that is—</p>

			<h3 class="head"><b>2. IN SENATE RESOLUTION (S. RES.) 680.</b></h3>
			<p>IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES OCTOBER 11, 2018 Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Mr. MURPHY, Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. WARREN, and Mr. VAN HOLLEN) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to RESOLUTION Calling on Congress, schools, and State and local educational agencies to recognize the significant educational implications of dyslexia that must be addressed, and designating October 2018 as “National Dyslexia Awareness Month.” Whereas dyslexia is— (1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader; and (2) most commonly caused by a difficulty in phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell, and often, the ability to learn a second language; Whereas dyslexia is the most common learning disability and affects 80 to 90 percent of all individuals with a learning disability; Whereas dyslexia is persistent and highly prevalent, affecting as many as 1 out of every 5 individuals; Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, in that an individual with dyslexia may have both— (1) weaknesses in decoding that result in difficulties in accurate or fluent word recognition; and (2) strengths in higher-level cognitive functions, such as reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, and problem solving; Whereas great progress has been made in understanding dyslexia on a scientific level, including the epidemiology and cognitive and neurobiological bases of dyslexia; Whereas the achievement gap between typical readers and dyslexic readers occurs as early as first grade; and Whereas early screening for, and early diagnosis of, dyslexia are critical for ensuring that individuals with dyslexia receive focused, evidence-based intervention that leads to fluent reading, promotion of self-awareness and self-empowerment, and the provision of necessary accommodations that ensure success in school and in life: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) calls on Congress, schools, and State and local educational agencies to recognize that dyslexia has significant educational implications that must be addressed.</p>

			<p>Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in English and mathematics were proposed in 2009 by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, and these have been adopted either wholly or partially by most states. For reading, there is a focus on ensuring that “all students must be able to comprehend texts of steadily increasing complexity as they progress through school.” Reading comprehension, particularly of expository or informational text, is the focus of CCSS in reading, and the goal is to, “by the end of grade 12, read and comprehend literature [informational texts, history/social studies texts, science/technical texts] at the high end of the grades 11–CCR text complexity band independently and proficiently.” Text complexity is determined both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative measures include features such as structure, language, and knowledge demands. Quantitative measures of text complexity relate to factors such as word frequency, sentence length, word familiarity, words per sentence, average grade level of words, and characters per word that are more efficiently measured by computer programs. An example of a quantitative measure is the Lexile score. CCSS text complexity grade bands are available for grades two through twelve and are linked to Lexile levels, which allow teachers to select particular texts at complexity levels recommended for students at any grade between two and twelve. Standards recommend that quantitative measures such as Lexile be used to determine the level of complexity of a particular text and that results be confirmed or overruled by a qualitative analysis of the text in question.</p>
			<p class="indent">Note that the Standards’ text complexity requirements do not begin until grade two. The Standards creators were aware that students in kindergarten and grade one are just beginning to acquire the reading code and there is great variability in mastering beginning reading. Furthermore, K–1 texts are not amenable to quantitative measure. CCSS expect second-graders to read and comprehend expository, informational literature in the grades 2–3 text complexity band proficiently by the end of the year.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> At the same time, CCSS instructional guidance does not include a focus on teaching decoding skills in early grades. In fact, such instruction is relegated to an appendix, with little emphasis on the importance of such instruction at the beginning of reading instruction.</p>

			<p class="indent">You may also be given a score referred to as the Full Scale IQ, a measure obtained by an algorithm based on virtually all subtests. If there is fairly good consistency among the five index scores, it is reasonable to consider the Full Scale IQ an appropriate measure of overall intellectual ability.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p class="indent"><i>CAUTION:</i> If, as often happens, there is great variability among these index scores, then it is <i>not</i> appropriate to use the Full Scale IQ score as a valid measure of intelligence. In such cases I find it is often helpful to focus on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), which reflects language and verbal reasoning proficiency and knowledge and is often associated with academic achievement. Others may use the Fluid Reasoning or, especially if the student excels in perceptual tasks, may find it useful to turn to the Visual Spatial Index as a measure of the child’s ability.</p>

				Learning Upgrade, led by Vinod Lobo, helps students learn English through songs, video, games, and rewards and is available for both Android and iOS devices at no cost. People ForWords, led by Southern Methodist University’s Simmons School of Education and Human Development, uses a mobile game based on an archaeological adventure storyline to help dyslexic adults improve their English reading skills and is available for Android devices at no cost. AmritaCREATE, led by Dr. Prema Nedungadi, uses engaging, culturally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_535" title="535"/>appropriate e-content linked to life skills and is available for Android and iOS devices at no cost. Cell-Ed, led by Dr. Jessica Rothenberg-Aalami, offers on-demand essential skills, microlessons, and personalized coaching for any mobile device, without Internet. AutoCognita, led by Frank Ho, applies a constructivist learning approach to engage dyslexic adults to acquire basic literacy through a comprehensive curriculum. These programs allow adult struggling readers to have an app that they can use autonomously to learn to read.</p>
