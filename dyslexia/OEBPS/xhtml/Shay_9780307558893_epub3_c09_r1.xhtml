			<p>Now that you have a clear understanding of the scientific roots of dyslexia, I want to show you how to translate this knowledge into practice, beginning with how to detect the earliest clues to dyslexia. I believe the most helpful guide to accurate identification and effective treatment of dyslexia comes from Bennett’s and my Sea of Strengths model: an isolated weakness in getting to the sounds of words surrounded by an array of higher-level strengths in thinking and reasoning. Using this simple model, many parents and teachers have become experts at recognizing the telltale signs of dyslexia, and you can, too. To begin, I want to describe exactly how a phonologic weakness impacts first spoken language and then written language.</p>
			<p class="indent">Applying our model, the essential ingredients of a successful program for the dyslexic child are</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112" title="112"/>I cannot emphasize enough the importance of focusing on the strengths as well as the weaknesses. The goal is to ensure that it is these strengths, and not the weaknesses, that define a child’s life. This is how we apply the Sea of Strengths model to recognizing signs of dyslexia in our children.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>LISTEN TO YOUR CHILD SPEAK</b></h2>
			<p>
				You will discover the earliest and perhaps the most important clues to a potential reading problem by <i>listening</i> to your child speak. Listening for subtle signs that your child’s phonologic skills are not developing as they should is a lot easier than it sounds. That’s because fuzzy phonemes leave their distinct mark on everyday language in highly predictable ways, influencing how well your child is able to pronounce certain words, sing nursery rhymes, and eventually learn the names and sounds of the letters of the alphabet.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>The very first clue to dyslexia may be <i>a delay in speaking.</i> As a general rule, children say their first words at about one year and phrases by eighteen months to two years. Children who may be dyslexic might not begin saying their first words until fifteen months or so and may not speak in phrases until after their second birthday.</p>
			</div>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> A seemingly innocent speech delay may be a very early warning signal of a future reading problem. Then again, some dyslexic children may not demonstrate a speech delay, or at least it may be subtle and go unnoticed.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Once a child begins to speak, <i>difficulties in pronunciation</i>—sometimes referred to as “baby talk”—that continue past the usual time may be another early warning. By five or six years of age, a child should have little problem saying most words correctly. Attempts to pronounce a new word for the first time or to say a long or complicated word can reveal problems with articulation. It is as if there were a jam in the articulatory machinery churning out spoken language and the phonemes were literally tripping over one another as they come out of the child’s mouth. Typical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113" title="113"/>mispronunciations involve either leaving off beginning sounds (such as saying <i>pisgetti</i> for <i>spaghetti, lephant</i> for <i>elephant</i>) or inverting the sounds within a word (<i>aminal</i> for <i>animal</i>). As part of one of our research studies, a group of six-year-old children with early signs of language difficulties were asked to repeat a series of words. Looking at the words and their pronunciations, you could just feel the phonologic mayhem that was occurring as each child tried to gather the appropriate phonemes and spew them out in some perceived order: physicist → <i>sysitist;</i> specific → <i>pacific, spestickit, pacissic, spastific.</i></p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Even older children and adults are not immune to tripping over phonologic debris, as the medical student Gregory came to know as he tried to pronounce the long (anatomical) names of body parts, or as any dyslexic soon discovers as she attempts to say unfamiliar or complicated words. Gregory was having difficulties with word retrieval, as you read earlier, a common symptom of dyslexia.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Most preschoolers love to play games with sounds and with rhyming words, and indeed, much of the humor in books geared to this age level exploits the young child’s fascination with rhyme. Three- and four-year-olds derive great glee from hearing and repeating sounds: for example, <i>Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater</i> or <i>Hickory, dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock.</i></p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Sensitivity to rhyme implies an awareness that words can be broken down into smaller segments of sound and that different words may have a sound in common; it is a very early indicator of getting ready to read. <i>Dyslexic children, on the other hand, have trouble penetrating the sound structure of words and pulling words apart. As a result, they are less sensitive to rhyme.</i> Children’s familiarity with nursery rhymes turns out to be a strong predictor of their later success in reading. <span id="ftn-71"/>In England, researchers asked three- and four-year-olds, “Can you say [for example] ‘Humpty-Dumpty’ for me?” Regardless of intelligence or family circumstances, children who were the most familiar with nursery rhymes were the top readers three years later.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114" title="114"/>At age four, parents may notice that their son is still not able to recite popular nursery rhymes. He may <i>confuse words that sound alike</i> or may not even appreciate that certain words rhyme.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>By age six or so, when most boys and girls are able to judge if two words rhyme, dyslexic children may <i>still not be able to demonstrate that they detect rhyme.</i> For example, when asked, “Do <i>food</i> and <i>foam</i> rhyme?” or “What about <i>talk</i> and <i>walk</i>?” dyslexic children are often unable to tell you which word pair rhymes. They are unable to focus on just one part of a word—in this example, <i>alk.</i></p>
				<p class="list0_indent"><span id="ftn-72"/>The British researchers also compared a group of children with reading difficulties to a group of younger children who read well. Each child was asked to listen to a list of words such as <i>fun, pin, bun,</i> and <i>gun</i> and then to select which word did not belong. Here the reading-disabled child’s troubles with rhyme became apparent. Although several years older, the poor readers experienced much more trouble choosing which word in the list did not rhyme. It is not a matter of maturation, just <i>an insensitivity to the sound structure of language</i>.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Not infrequently, <i>an incorrect phoneme is accessed.</i> As I mentioned earlier, a child like Amy looks at a picture of a volcano (which she has seen many times) and the word she pulls up is <i>tornado</i>—close in sound but not in meaning.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Because of difficulties in accessing the intended phonemes, a child may <i>talk around a word,</i> as Alex did when he could not retrieve the word <i>ocean,</i> or he may begin to say a word and end up with a series of <i>um</i>’s or “Um, um, um…I forgot.”</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Such children often <i>point instead of speaking</i> or <i>become tearful or angry</i> as they become increasingly frustrated at being unable to utter the word they have in mind.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>As a child gets older, she may resort to <i>using words lacking in precision or specificity</i> to cover up her retrieval difficulties, such as constantly using vague words like <i>stuff</i> and <i>things</i> instead of the actual name of the object. Sometimes it may be hard to follow the conversation of a dyslexic because her sentences are so filled with pronouns or words lacking in specificity: “You know, I went and picked up the stuff and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115" title="115"/>took it there. The things were all mixed up, but I got the stuff anyway.” <i>It is important to remember that the problem is with word retrieval and not with thinking.</i> She knows exactly what she wants to say; the difficulty is with pulling the right word out. These word-retrieval language difficulties continue as the child matures. She <i>may be quiet, appear inarticulate, or in general experience difficulties expressing herself</i>. This is a frequent pattern, but it is not invariable, and in fact some dyslexic children may be quite articulate or fluent when they speak.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">As with Alex and Gregory, the ideas are often advanced; it is the need to produce a word on command that is problematic for the dyslexic child. Parents and teachers may become irritated with a child because he seems so bright and they cannot understand why he spits out the wrong word. As a dyslexic child matures into adulthood, his speech continues to show evidence of his difficulties getting to the sound structure of words. <i>His speech is littered with hesitations;</i> sometimes there are many long pauses, or he may talk around a word, using many indirect words in place of the single word he can’t seem to come up with (technically referred to as circumlocution). He is neither glib nor fluent in his spoken language.</p>
			<p class="indent">Given a choice, the dyslexic can almost always <i>recognize</i> the correct word. For example, if asked whether a sudden ghostly appearance is an <i>apparition</i> or a <i>partition,</i> a dyslexic will invariably choose the correct response. However, when confronted and put on the spot to recall or come up with the word for a sudden ghostly appearance, the dyslexic may reach into his lexicon and pull out a word that sounds similar to the word he intended—in this instance, <i>partition</i> instead of <i>apparition.</i> For those who do not understand the phonologic basis of this confusion, it may appear that the child guessed or is totally confused.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Parents must always keep in mind (and remind their child’s teacher) that these are phonologic slips and that the child most likely knows the meaning of the word but just can’t get it out. Commonly the child (or adult) will say, “It was just on the tip of my tongue,” or “I just can’t get the word out. It’s stuck.”</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>It is also good to keep in mind, and to remind the child’s teacher, that he understands many more words than he can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116" title="116"/>articulate well. This is why it is well known that a dyslexic child’s listening vocabulary (understanding words that he hears) is much larger than his spoken language vocabulary.</p>

This <i>is</i> the beginning of reading. It is a necessary if not entirely sufficient accomplishment that must be in place in order to read.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Conversely, difficulty in acquiring these skills is an early warning signal that your child may have a reading problem. All the clues I have discussed in this section must be followed up quickly and seriously. I cannot overemphasize that.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p>As children mature, they develop a sensitivity to the parts of language. Initially spoken language is like a strip of movie film: It appears continuous and without any breaks. With time, children begin to appreciate the segmental nature of language. Just as strips of film on closer examination are composed of individual frames, ribbons of speech can be broken down into separate words; words in turn can be pulled apart into syllables, and syllables into particles—phonemes.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">

At this stage the alphabet is really an undifferentiated string going from A to Z; children generally are not aware of the individual letters. If you stop a three-year-old child in the middle of singing the ABC song and ask what letter comes next, she most likely will have to start to sing the song all over again. This is perfectly normal. The ABC song helps a child become familiar with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117" title="117"/>the names of the letters, and it is not expected that she will be able to differentiate individual letters until she is a little older.</p>

Mastering letter-sound relationships is the focus of intense activity during the kindergarten year, and children generally leave kindergarten knowing the sounds of most of the letters of the alphabet.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Gradually and sequentially, from the time children are toddlers through their first year of formal education, they are busily acquiring these raw materials for becoming a reader: knowledge of the alphabet, recognition of individual letters, and the ability to associate sounds with letters. Failure or delay in acquiring these skills is among the earliest clues to a potential reading problem.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DIGGING INTO YOUR GENETIC ROOTS</b></h2>
			<p>
				With the remarkable progress in genetics, the initial hope that dyslexia would be explained by one gene or just a few genes has not been fulfilled. Studies in identical twins have shown that although an individual’s genetic makeup contributes to the risk of having dyslexia, other factors, such as the environment (including family, community, school, and health), likely play a major role as well. If dyslexia were entirely genetic, both members of a set of identical twins (sharing the exact genes) would have dyslexia. However, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118" title="118"/>in only 60 to 70 percent of the cases are both twins dyslexic; in 30 to 40 percent one identical twin is dyslexic and the other reads well.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition to nongenetic factors playing a role in the risk for dyslexia, it appears that the genetic component itself is quite complex and not explainable by one or even a few genes. <span id="ftn-73"/>Much to the chagrin of scientists studying the genetics of dyslexia, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found that a number of genes were involved, each producing a small effect. Recent advances in genetics have confirmed what the GWAS studies suggested. As articulated by the science writer Ed Yong, <span id="ftn-74"/>“If you told a modern geneticist that a complex trait—whether a physical characteristic like height or weight, or the risk of a disease like cancer or schizophrenia—was the work of just 15 genes, they’d probably laugh. It’s now thought that such traits are the work of thousands of genetic variants, working in concert. The vast majority of them have only tiny effects.” Distinguished geneticist Simon Fisher has commented on <span id="ftn-75"/>“the popular misconception of genes as abstract entities that directly specify traits, including key aspects of human cognition and behaviour. Actually, there’s an enormous gap between DNA and the distal outcome [e.g., reading]…there is no one-to-one mapping between a single gene and a specific neural circuit.”</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> I must share with you my deep concern with the often thoughtless embrace of genetics based on ignorance of the actual science or misrepresentation of the scientific data. I feel compelled to emphasize that current evidence suggests <span id="ftn-76"/>“that common diseases involve thousands of genes and proteins interacting on complex pathways” and that similar to experience with other complex disorders (such as heart disease and diabetes), <i>it is unlikely that a single gene or even a few genes will reliably identify people with dyslexia. Rather, dyslexia is best explained by multiple genes, each contributing a small amount toward the expression of dyslexia.</i> The search for a gene to detect dyslexia has been very disappointing. Obviously, I would not look to genetics to reliably identify whether your child is dyslexic. <i>Parents should be very skeptical about any genetic testing that claims to diagnose dyslexia, not only in infancy but at any stage of life.</i> At the same time, parents should look to evidence-based screening and diagnostic assessments that do in fact reliably diagnose dyslexia.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-77"/>As conceptualized by Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford, even if one or more gene(s) are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119" title="119"/>slightly more common in a dyslexic population, the gene or genes are still quite common in nondyslexics. Since there are so many more nondyslexics, the gene will appear in many more nondyslexics than it will in those who may be dyslexic. This means that a positive genetics test is not at all equivalent to a definitive determination of dyslexia and a negative test does not rule out dyslexia. Professor Bishop warns that <span id="ftn-78"/>“it would be ineffective to screen children for future dyslexia on the basis of these DNA variants…there are many failures to replicate findings of association in this field….”</p>
			<p class="indent">That does not mean that there is no genetic influence in dyslexia but rather that the influences are complex (perhaps many, many genes each contributing a small fraction of risk) and/or that other, nongenetic contributions play an important role. Like many common conditions (such as type 2 diabetes), dyslexia sometimes runs in families. Having a parent or a sibling who is dyslexic may increase the possibility that you are, too, but it doesn’t mean that you are going to develop dyslexia. In fact, our Connecticut Longitudinal Study data led us to conclude that family history as a screening measure is unwarranted and potentially counterproductive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Regardless of whether we can point to a familial or genetic influence on dyslexia, does this affect how we treat children with dyslexia? As if to emphasize this point, I am often asked if anything can be done to help if dyslexia is inherited. Of course it can. Many disorders that are inherited (therefore pointing to a genetic component) respond well to treatment (again, such as type 2 diabetes). Ironically, being aware of reading problems in a child may also promote increased awareness of one of his parents’ own struggles with reading; the writer John Irving and the financier Charles Schwab both discovered they were dyslexic after their children were diagnosed. Many adults often wonder if they may be dyslexic. To determine if they are at risk for dyslexia, we have developed an adult version of our screener, the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™, Adolescent-Adult Form (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c29_r1.xhtml#page_406">this page</a>).</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>MYTHS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>While being alert for clues to dyslexia, it is also important to be aware of some of the popular misconceptions and myths surrounding it. Sometimes a child’s diagnosis is wrong or delayed because she fails to demonstrate one or more of these presumed “symptoms.”</p>
			<p class="indent">One of the most enduring misconceptions is that dyslexic children see letters and words backward and that reversals (writing letters and words <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" title="120"/>backward) are an invariable sign of dyslexia. While it is true that dyslexic children have difficulties in attaching the appropriate labels or names to letters and words, there is no evidence that they actually <i>see</i> letters and words backward. In one study, primary-school children who had reading problems and a tendency to make reversals were asked to copy a series of letters and words. They had no difficulty doing so. What they did find troublesome was having to <i>name</i> the words accurately. For example, the children were able to copy the word <i>was</i> and to say the individual letters making up the word in the appropriate order. Then, typically, they would name the word as <i>saw.</i> This study confirmed that dyslexic children have problems in naming but not in copying letters. A related misconception is that mirror writing invariably accompanies dyslexia. In fact, backward writing and reversals of letters and words are common in the early stages of writing development among dyslexic and nondyslexic children alike.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because these beliefs about dyslexia are so prevalent, many dyslexic children who do not make reversals are often misdiagnosed. In the words of one frustrated father who was trying to obtain help for his daughter, “They say she doesn’t have a problem, she just has to work harder, and that she can’t have dyslexia because she doesn’t transpose letters or write backward.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Left-handedness, difficulties with right-left orientation, trouble tying shoelaces, and clumsiness have at times also been said to be associated with dyslexia. These are certainly not core findings that we would expect to observe in most people with dyslexia, but of course within the larger population of individuals with dyslexia, there are clusters of people who are also left-handed or who have difficulties with right-left orientation. Whatever subgroups of children with dyslexia may exist, it is clear that the vast majority of the dyslexic population share a common phonologic weakness (about 88 percent, our research team determined).</p>
