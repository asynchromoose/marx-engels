			<p>Virtually everyone who is diagnosed as dyslexic, whether it is a Yale student, an Uber driver, a physician, a middle-school boy or girl, a mom, or a retired senior citizen, comes with a full load of anxiety. In fact, it is rare to see a dyslexic who doesn’t also have anxiety or, for that matter, ADHD. It is important to be aware of these very common comorbid conditions, for they too must be recognized, diagnosed, explained, and treated if the dyslexic individual is to have an optimal outcome. <span id="ftn-169"/>Anxiety and ADHD so commonly occur along with dyslexia that it is critical that once someone is diagnosed as dyslexic, anxiety and ADHD must be asked about. Both anxiety and ADHD are well described and well delineated, and each can be treated effectively. In the following sections we review each of these conditions that commonly occur along with dyslexia.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>ANXIETY</b></h2>
			<p>
				Sam was a second-year medical student attending a prestigious school. He was diagnosed with dyslexia in middle school and struggled particularly with standardized tests and oral examinations. Sam was able to persevere due to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_420" title="420"/>his own resilience but also because of the incredible support he had from his family, including his mother and father and two brothers. Sam remembers his long and sometimes arduous journey to get where he is. It made him so anxious not to know when he would be called on to read aloud or when he would have to go off to a special room to take his exams. He remembers the stares of the other children in middle school and high school while he took his examinations in a separate room with extra time. He remembers hearing his fellow classmates complain to the teachers, “That is not fair. Why does Sam get extra time and we don’t?” Sam could not comprehend this, since he wished he didn’t need to take the extra time and could be like everyone else. He also remembers being told by one of his admissions counselors that he would never get into a medical school. “There are other good professions,” he was told. He remembers one of his medical school teachers patronizingly imploring the rest of the class, “Would someone please tell Sam what is going on?” Sam used all these comments for motivation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sam was diagnosed with anxiety. He was a shy child growing up but had friends and a wonderful childhood. At college, particularly in stressful situations, he experienced panic attacks. During these attacks, lasting fifteen minutes at most, he had a choking sensation, heart palpitations, and a feeling of impending doom; he felt he was having a heart attack and was going to die. The anticipation of these attacks made him even more anxious. Performance situations such as written or oral examinations would often trigger the panic attacks, as would meeting individuals in social situations. Group study projects or oral examinations or public speaking made him so anxious that at times he would try to avoid the situations altogether. When he couldn’t avoid them, his anxiety would become so great that his hands would begin to tremble, he would sweat, and he would lose his focus and concentration.</p>
			<p class="indent">When this anxiety became debilitating, Sam sought professional help from a psychiatrist. Through his discussions with his psychiatrist and through reading, Sam learned that anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and can actually be beneficial. In some situations, however, anxiety can become excessive, and while the person suffering may realize the anxiety is excessive, he may also have difficulty controlling it and it may negatively affect his day-to-day living. Sam was informed by his psychiatrist that the spectrum of anxiety disorders includes social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. He was also told that given his symptoms, he most likely had both social anxiety disorder and panic disorder (PD).</p>
			<p class="indent">Social anxiety disorder is the third most prevalent psychiatric disorder in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_421" title="421"/>the United States, following major depression and alcoholism. It is defined in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,</i> fifth edition:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span id="ftn-170"/>Marked fear, anxiety, or avoidance of social interactions and situations that involve being scrutinized or being the focus of attention, such as being observed while speaking, eating, or performing in front of others.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Fear negative judgment from others and, in particular, fear of being embarrassed, humiliated, or rejected, or offending others.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">It often first appears in adolescence, at around fifteen or sixteen years of age. A great number of people are so affected by it that they cannot work or start or maintain professional relationships. There is also a high comorbidity of social anxiety disorder with major depression.</p>
			<p class="indent">Panic disorder (PD) is also common, with a prevalence perhaps as high as 2 percent of the population. Like many anxiety disorders, a combination of biologic and environmental factors is involved in PD. The onset is often in late adolescence and early adulthood, and PD occurs more often in women than men. The core symptoms involve short, discrete periods of intense fear accompanied by somatic symptoms such as a racing heart, sweating, and shortness of breath. It is defined in the <i>DSM</i> fifth edition:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks which involve an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within minutes and include four or more symptoms (including palpitations, sweating, trembling, feeling short of breath, feeling of choking, chest discomfort, nausea, lightheadedness, fear of losing control, numbness, and chills).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-171"/>Sam’s problems with word retrieval, so common in dyslexic readers, were especially exacerbated by his anxiety. In the top portion of Figure 48, a typical reader uses his intact higher-order thinking abilities, as you have previously seen (<a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page_58">this page</a>), to develop a concept and identify the abstract semantic representation of the word that represents this concept. For typical readers the next step in this two-step process—uttering the word—is performed smoothly. For the dyslexic reader (bottom portion of Figure 48), the first step, using his cognitive ability, is performed well, but the second <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_422" title="422"/>step is disrupted and made even worse by anxiety (for further details, see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page_58">this page</a>).</p>

			<p class="indent">Sam had always been very resistant to taking psychiatric medications, believing it was a “sign of weakness” and that he should be able to “be strong and power his way through it.” However, when his psychiatrist posed the question, “Sam, if I told you that you had high blood pressure or diabetes, would you be reluctant to start those medications?,” Sam knew it was more the “stigma” of being on psychiatric medication that bothered him than the medication itself, and he agreed to give it a chance.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-172"/>The medications effective in treating anxiety (as well as ADHD) generally work by acting on neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that either stimulate or inhibit neuronal impulses in particular areas of the brain. <span id="ftn-173"/>The core first-line medications employed include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). Other commonly used medications include the serotonin and norepinephrine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_423" title="423"/>reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including venlafaxine (Effexor), the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SDRI) buproprion (Wellbutrin), and the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist mirtazapine (Remeron). These medications are all equally effective in treating anxiety; there have been no head-to-head long-term studies demonstrating superiority of one medication over another. In selecting an anxiety medication, it is important to consider the history of a family member being effectively treated on the medication, other medications the patient is currently taking (to avoid negative drug-drug interactions), the possible side effects, and how long the medication stays in a person’s system.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sam was placed on the SSRI sertraline (Zoloft). All SSRIs can take up to four weeks to become effective and have similar side effects, the most common including gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and diarrhea, and sexual side effects, including anorgasmia (failure to have an orgasm) and decreased libido. There is also potential weight gain and some sedation with this class of medications.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-174"/>Another class of medications that are employed in the treatment of anxiety disorders include the benzodiazepines. The common ones include diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and lorazepam (Ativan). In addition to concerns about tolerance and dependence, side effects include drowsiness and potential cognitive impairment at higher doses. Benzodiazepines are immediately effective, which is particularly helpful when individuals are having a panic attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">The psychiatrist discussed all this with Sam and explained another class of medications, beta-blockers, which are helpful in controlling the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as sweating, trembling, increased heart rate, and blushing when giving a talk or taking a test. These symptoms are believed to be the result of epinephrine release, which is inhibited by the beta-blockers. These medications do not affect the cognitive aspects of anxiety and affect only the physical symptoms. Propranolol (Inderal) is a popular beta-blocker. Its onset is immediate, and potential side effects include decreased heart rate, fatigue, weight gain, and depression.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sam was also informed that medications were only part of the treatment for anxiety disorders. <span id="ftn-175"/>An equally important treatment involved undergoing individual behavioral therapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). As you read earlier, CBT is aimed at changing a person’s current way of nonproductive thinking and behavior, a change that is often transformative, producing improvement in outlook and mood. It is typically provided <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_424" title="424"/>by a psychologist with special training in the methodology and is backed by evidence of its effectiveness in children and adolescents, particularly for anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>
			<p class="indent">Cognitive behavioral therapy generally involves eight to twelve structured sessions divided into exploring the patient’s cognitive thoughts and behaviors. The patient first is made aware of his distorted thinking and then taught behaviors to help alleviate them. Sam’s distorted thoughts included believing that he was always being scrutinized and was the center of attention when he entered a social situation. He believed that the other individuals in the social situation were judging him negatively. In CBT, Sam was asked by his therapist for evidence to support these automatic thoughts. Sam learned that these cognitive distortions were called “catastrophizing.” His therapy sessions also included “graded desensitization,” during which he would gradually go to different social settings with increasing anxiety potential. He initially went to a coffee shop by himself and then rated his anxiety. Several days later he went to a small party where he knew everyone, and again rated his anxiety. After several weeks he attended a large gathering where he knew no one and again rated his anxiety. The goal of this behavioral therapy was to expose Sam in a stepwise progression to gradually more unfamiliar and larger settings to decrease his anxiety symptoms.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sam underwent CBT and was started on sertraline, with the addition of clonazapam to be used as needed if he experienced a panic attack. He was also given Inderal, to be used before performance situations such as giving a presentation or taking a test. He initially found the sertraline to be sedating but after several weeks experienced no side effects from the medications. He did not like alcohol, so it was easy for him not to have to worry about not drinking while on the medications. He found the combination of the medications and CBT particularly effective for his test-taking anxiety during oral presentations and standardized examinations.</p>
			<p class="indent">Since Sam was dyslexic, his test-taking anxiety was exacerbated. At such times, he especially found practicing mindfulness, based on an ancient Buddhist concept, very helpful in diminishing his anxiety. Mindfulness can be promoted by meditation, but it is not synonymous with meditation. Mindfulness is achieved through a variety of activities, including yoga, tai chi, and meditation, which have in common the goal of trying to bring mental processes under greater personal control through training attention and awareness. The hoped-for (and often observed) result is a sense of calm, clarity, and focus. There is clinical evidence that mindfulness decreases anxiety and increases a sense of positivity.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_425" title="425"/>The principles of mindset can help ameliorate anxiety as well. <span id="ftn-176"/>As discussed in Carol Dweck’s insightful book, <i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,</i> mindset refers to your attitude about yourself, your abilities, and your future. The growth mindset championed by Dweck is based on the belief that change can be brought about by the individual, which is welcome news to dyslexics. If you harbor the belief that change is possible and that effort translates into positive change, then if you work on improving a quality or characteristic, your effort will eventually pay off. Think of the successful dyslexic writers, athletes, doctors, scientists, attorneys, public servants, and those in entertainment noted earlier, who struggled when younger and who through continuing effort are now at the very top of their respective fields. Dweck reminds us that when NASA was asking for applications for astronauts, “they rejected people with pure histories of success and instead selected people who had significant failures and bounced back from them.” Dyslexics, all too familiar with failure, have developed a growth mindset and succeeded.</p>
			<p class="indent">While anxiety and dyslexia were a part of Sam, he made sure they never defined him. He was able to graduate from one of the top medical schools in the country and is now a board-certified physician doing what he loves to do.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)</b></h2>
			<p>
				Attention is intertwined with dyslexia for two important but very different reasons. First, as you have read, dyslexic readers are not automatic; to them reading remains effortful. I have referred to them as “manual” readers. This means that they have to dip into and soon use up their reservoir bucket (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c10_r1.xhtml#page_136">this page</a>) of attention in order to read, so that they become attention-deprived. As a result they appear to have an attentional deficit, so that after reading a short time they become easily distracted. Second, there is a very large overlap or comorbidity between ADHD and dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sophia was in the seventh grade and had been diagnosed with dyslexia. Her reading had improved dramatically with the help of tutors and the provision of extra time on tests, and her grades had improved as well. <span id="ftn-177"/>At the same time, her teachers had noticed that she was becoming inattentive in class and was easily distracted. They described her as “not being focused” and “not being able to follow instructions.” These behaviors were also noticed by her parents at home. When they asked Sophia about her day, her mind would wander and she would take a long time to answer their straightforward <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_426" title="426"/>questions. Both her teachers and her parents noticed that she was often sidetracked when asked to complete an assignment and would take a long time to do it, if she completed it at all. Sophia was disorganized at home, often losing or misplacing her schoolwork. After many months without any improvement, her parents, with a recommendation from the school, sought a consultation with a child psychiatrist.</p>
			<p class="indent">The psychiatrist spoke at length with Sophia and her parents. With the parents’ consent, she also spoke with officials at the school and gave Sophia two rating scales to help with the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: the ADHD rating scale and the Conners rating scale. After reviewing all the information, she told Sophia and her parents it was most likely that Sophia had a form of ADHD, predominantly Inattentive Type. Sophia’s parents were told that the co-occurrence (or comorbidity) of dyslexia and ADHD is quite common. In our own studies, when we considered a sample based on children referred to a clinic for learning disability, 40 percent of the children with dyslexia were also found to have symptoms of ADHD, and over half the children with ADHD were found to have dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">The psychiatrist explained to Sophia and her parents that ADHD is characterized by three cardinal symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Clinicians have come to recognize that the hyperactivity and impulsivity seem to track together, and inattention often appears separately. Clinicians recognize these as three types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and combined type (children with all three symptoms). Sophia most likely had ADHD predominantly inattentive type. This type of ADHD is usually not apparent until the child is eight or nine years old and usually is lifelong. The symptoms, according to the newest <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i> (<i>DSM</i> 5), include:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">The child psychiatrist also emphasized to Sophia and her parents that ADHD is a clinical diagnosis and cautioned that at present, while rating scales are helpful, there is no evidence-based test that will reliably diagnose ADHD. They were urged to be skeptical of any measures claiming to identify ADHD, despite claims for EEG measures or experimental psychological measures such as continuous performance tests.</p>
			<p class="indent">The psychiatrist told Sophia and her parents that good interventions have been developed and there is a long and successful history of therapy for ADHD, both using medications and behavioral interventions. The main pharmacotherapy treatment options include stimulants, atomoxetine, antidepressants, and alpha-2 agonists. The behavioral treatment strategy for children and young adults with ADHD includes working with the child, the parents, and the school. The child and the parents strive to maintain a daily schedule, reward positive activities, set small but realistic goals, and use checklists to help the child stay focused. The school can help by providing accommodations, including extra time to complete assignments and taking tests in a separate room to avoid distractions. The school can also arrange to have the child sit close to the teacher and provide note-takers to help her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_428" title="428"/>organize assignments and work. Other behavioral treatment strategies for ADHD include physical activity as well as mindfulness.</p>
			<p class="indent">The stimulants begin to work immediately. They include methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamines (such as Adderall) and come in both short- and long-acting preparations. The short-acting preparations can last up to six hours, while the longer-acting preparations, such as methylphenidate ER (Concerta), amphetamine/dextramphetamine XR (Adderall XR), and lisdexamphetamine (Vyvanse), can last from ten to twelve hours. While generally safe, the stimulants can cause anorexia, growth retardation, jitteriness, exacerbation of existing tics, and increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Atomoxetine (Strattera), a <i>nonstimulant,</i> is another class of medications used to treat ADHD. Its mechanism of action includes increasing the amount of available norepinephrine, and unlike the stimulants it can take up to three weeks to begin to act. It can last up to twelve hours and can cause dry mouth, constipation, nausea, headaches, and palpitations. Antidepressants are a third class of medication options used to treat ADHD. Buproprion (Wellbutrin) is the most common among them. Its effects can last up to fifteen hours, though it can cause seizures, hypertension, and increased anxiety. The fourth class of psychotropic medications include the alpha-2 agonists, such as clonidine (Catapres), which work by indirectly increasing norepinephrine, and their benefit can last up to twelve hours. The side effects can include dry mouth, low blood pressure, and sedation. Clonidine is classified as a category C medication, meaning that there can be potential detrimental effects on fetal development.</p>
			<p class="indent">After careful consideration and review with her parents and her psychiatrist, Sophia selected the long-acting stimulant Concerta and was prescribed 18 mg/day. She found the medication very effective in helping her focus; her teachers and parents noticed a positive change in her behavior at home and at school. Sophia tolerated the medication well but noticed a decrease in her appetite and feeling “jittery” when she first started the medication. Because she took the medication in the morning, it did not affect her sleep, and she took “drug holidays” on weekends, when there was no school, which she found helpful as well. Sophia worked with her parents and the school psychologist on behavioral techniques, including setting daily schedules and making lists to help complete assignments. She was granted accommodations by the school, including extra time on exams, which she was able to take in a separate room.</p>
