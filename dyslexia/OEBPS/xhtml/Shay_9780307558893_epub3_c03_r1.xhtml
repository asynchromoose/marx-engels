			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>THE BIG PICTURE: WHO IS AFFECTED AND WHAT HAPPENS OVER TIME</b></h1>
			<p>Research over the last several decades has produced unparalleled results, particularly for our understanding of reading and dyslexia. Given that I am most intimately aware of the details of our own work at the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity, and because our center’s research strategy and findings reflect and provide valuable insights into the state of current research in the field, I will use our studies as a model for discussion.</p>
			<p class="indent">At first we focused on the basic characteristics of the disorder, designing a research study aimed at answering these questions: Who is dyslexic? How many children are affected? Are boys and girls both affected? What happens to a child with dyslexia over time, and how long does the problem last? When does the problem go away, or is it with someone for his or her entire life? Many of the answers have emerged from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study, which has been ongoing for over three decades.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE CONNECTICUT LONGITUDINAL STUDY</b></h2>
			<p>
				In 1978, when I was asked to care for patients with reading difficulties, it was unclear to me just how a physician takes care of children who are dyslexic. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26" title="26"/>There were many basic questions for which I could find no satisfactory answers. For example, is dyslexia a common problem or a rare one? Most of the information about dyslexia was based on studies of children who had already been identified—either by their schools or by a clinic—as having a reading problem. I thought there might be large numbers of children sitting at their desks in classrooms all over the country who were unable to read but who had never been accounted for in studies of dyslexia. To understand the full scope of the problem we needed to count <i>all</i> children with reading problems and not only those who were already visible and receiving help.</p>
			<p class="indent">In order to differentiate between children who were experiencing reading problems and those who were learning to read with ease, it was necessary to establish exactly what rate of reading development, what behaviors, and what characteristics are typical for children. That would require studying large numbers of children over an extended period—as it turned out, from the time they entered kindergarten well into mature adulthood and the workplace.</p>
			<p class="indent">To begin the study we selected children attending kindergartens in twenty-four randomly chosen Connecticut public schools in the 1983–84 school year. We worked with expert statisticians to select a study sample that represented the geographic and demographic diversity of Connecticut and the nation as a whole at that time. Since we wanted to develop a more nuanced understanding of each of these children, we gathered information representing a range of qualities, including cognitive ability, academic achievement, behavior at home and in the classroom, and self-perception. We obtained information from parents, teachers, and the children themselves. For the most in-depth understanding of each child, parents shared personal information about themselves, including their behaviors, family history, schooling, and employment. The criteria for those to be enrolled in the study were purposely left very broad; we did not want to influence the results by excluding any particular group of children.</p>
			<p class="indent">We enrolled 445 children in the study, representing 95 percent of those eligible. The group’s gender, ethnic, and racial composition was representative of the population of children entering public kindergarten that year. The participants have been regularly monitored since then. The boys and girls who began this study are now mature men and women. Some graduated from high school, some dropped out, some hold GED degrees; some hold college, graduate, and professional school degrees; some are working in a wide range of fields, others are not employed; some have married and are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27" title="27"/>now parents; some are in jail. Although they now live in thirty-four different states and have lived in at least seven foreign countries, the vast majority of the original participants (80 percent) continue to be committed to the Connecticut Longitudinal Study. Their experiences provide a panoramic view of the process of learning to read. Each of these young men and women is owed a huge debt of gratitude.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>MODELS OF READING AND DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>
				One of the first questions the Connecticut study addressed was the relation between good and poor readers: Do they form a continuum, or are they two distinct groups? Our educational policy for the identification of reading-disabled children in the past has often been based on the belief that there exists a gap in nature that allows us to easily separate dyslexic from all other readers. As Scottish psychiatrist R. E. Kendell said, <span id="ftn-20"/>“Classification is the art of carving nature at the joints; it should indeed imply that there is a joint there, that one is not sawing through bone.” Results of our research suggest that in dyslexia, like virtually every other biological condition occurring in nature (except for pregnancy, extra digits, life and death), there is no natural joint separating dyslexic and good readers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Evidence from the Connecticut study, as well as from Britain, Ireland, and New Zealand, provides a picture of an unbroken continuum of reading ability and reading disability, a conceptualization referred to as a <i>dimensional</i> model by researchers. The contrasting <i>categorical</i> model features discontinuity—a natural break in the linkage between good and poor readers. A dimensional model recognizes that there are no natural joints in nature to separate one group of readers from another and that while such cutoff points may be imposed, they are accepted as arbitrary.</p>
			<p class="indent">In truth, the need to refer to disorders, even those that occur along a continuum, by a specific diagnostic label often obscures the fact that many, if not most, disorders in nature occur in gradations and thus conform to a dimensional rather than a categorical model. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes represent common dimensional disorders; visual and hearing deficits also occur along a continuum. When blood pressure reaches a certain level, a patient is considered to have hypertension, but individuals just on the other side of the cutoff point, although not labeled as hypertensive, will share many traits in common with those said to have hypertension. For hypertension, as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28" title="28"/>for dyslexia, there is no natural gap separating affected people from others, and a predetermined decision is made about where to place the cutoff point.</p>
			<p class="indent">The demonstration that reading difficulties occur along a continuum brings with it important practical educational implications, especially since most current policies for the provision of educational services for reading disability reflect a different view of dyslexia—the categorical view, a cutoff point.</p>
			<p class="indent">Not recognizing shades of grey represented by struggling children who haven’t yet failed enough to meet a particular criterion, schools may be under-identifying many children who will go on to experience significant reading problems. Data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study indicate that this is more than a theoretical possibility. As I will discuss later, science has made great progress in delineating the nature of dyslexia, including the underlying difficulty, and with this knowledge, the predictable symptoms that characterize children (and adults) who are dyslexic. Thus, the most appropriate approach to diagnosing dyslexia is what is referred to as a clinical synthesis of all the relevant information about the child—obtaining developmental and academic history, listening to him reading aloud, carefully reviewing scores on a battery of tests, and determining if the child demonstrates signs of dyslexia.</p>

			</div>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE PREVALENCE OF DYSLEXIA</b></h2>
			<p>
				Figures provided by schools that indicate the number of children receiving educational services for learning disability provide only a crude approximation of dyslexia’s prevalence. While dyslexia is by far the most common and best-validated learning disability, schools are not asked to indicate how many students are identified as <i>dyslexic.</i> Hopefully this will change in the near future.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-21"/>According to the most recent U.S. Department of Education statistics, last updated on April 20, 2018, 34 percent of the 6.7 million children receiving special education services (14 percent of the total public school enrollment of children ages three through twenty-one) are receiving these services for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29" title="29"/>specific learning disabilities. <span id="ftn-22"/>Since dyslexia is estimated to comprise at least 80 percent of all learning disabilities, we can infer that about 2 million children (about 4 percent of the school population) are receiving special educational services for dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">In contrast, large-scale surveys that directly measure reading proficiency indicate that dyslexia may be far more prevalent. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), carried out by an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, tests a representative sample of over 270,000 students in reading and mathematics biannually and provides at each grade an indication of how many of these children are reading at or below a level considered to be standard or proficient for that grade. The NAEP assessment measures reading by asking students to read grade-level materials and then answer questions based on what they have read. Data from the 2019 NAEP indicate that overall less than half of all students are proficient in fourth-grade reading. Among some groups of students, the numbers are far worse. Only about one in five African American, Hispanic, and Native American students are proficient in fourth-grade reading. In a 1998 NAEP survey, 55 percent of the children of college graduates performed below proficiency levels in reading achievement in the eighth grade.</p>
			<p class="indent">Moreover, according to the 2019 NAEP data, as many as 34 percent of fourth-graders had not achieved even the most basic or rudimentary skills in reading. In some groups, particularly African American students, more than 50 percent of fourth-graders have not achieved those levels. Concern about children’s reading has a long history and led the Committee on Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children of the National Research Council to conclude in 1998 that “the educational careers of 25 to 40 percent of American children are imperiled because they don’t read well enough, quickly enough, or easily enough.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-23"/>Data from our Connecticut Longitudinal Study indicate that dyslexia affects approximately one child in five. From a national perspective, this means that there is not a family in America that has not been touched by dyslexia in some way—a child, a spouse, a grandchild, a sister or a brother, a niece or a nephew, a friend or a neighbor.</p>
			<p class="indent">There is an important difference in how children are identified as dyslexic by schools and by research studies. For example, in the Connecticut study, each child was administered a test of intelligence and a reading test individually. Using this methodology, we found that about 20 percent of children are dyslexic. Contrast this with the approximately 4 percent of children <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30" title="30"/>currently diagnosed as dyslexic and it is obvious that schools are failing to diagnose the great majority of dyslexic students, children who could be helped. This constitutes one of the great tragedies in American education in the twenty-first century.</p>
			<p class="indent">We were curious to know how many of the children identified as dyslexic by our research study had been identified as such by their schools. Accordingly, for each child in the study, we asked school personnel to tell us if that child had been identified as having a reading disability or as dyslexic and if he had received special help for a reading problem. We found that <i>less than one-third of children who were dyslexic were receiving school services for their reading difficulty,</i> strongly suggesting undiagnosed problems.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-24"/>The apparent large-scale under-identification of dyslexic children is particularly worrisome because even when school identification takes place, it occurs relatively late—often past the optimal age for intervention. Dyslexic children are generally in the third grade or above when they are first identified by their schools; reading disabilities diagnosed after third grade are often extremely difficult to remediate. This failure to identify early takes on particular significance in view of our published data indicating that a large achievement gap between typical and dyslexic readers is already present in grade one. Early identification is important because the brain is much more plastic in younger children and potentially more malleable for the rerouting of neural circuits. Equally important, once a pattern of reading failure sets in, many children become defeated, lose interest in reading, and develop what often evolves into a lifelong loss of their own sense of self-worth. Importantly, inspired by these data indicating the early presence of the achievement gap between typical and dyslexic readers, I worked toward, and have developed, an evidence-based screening instrument: The Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ is for children in kindergarten to grade three and is completed by the child’s teacher on a tablet. The result is a determination of at-risk or not at-risk for dyslexia. (For more details, see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c13_r1.xhtml#page_169">this page</a>.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Dyslexia occurs in children and adults living in northern Europe, southern Europe, Scandinavia, England, Australia, the Middle East, and North and South America. At one point it was thought that dyslexia affected only those who used alphabetic writing systems, such as English and German, and that those who used written language systems that were primarily logographic, such as Chinese and Japanese, were not at-risk for dyslexia. This assumption has proven to be false. Researchers have found comparable prevalence rates for dyslexia among American, Japanese, and Chinese children: for example, almost 13 percent in Hong Kong.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31" title="31"/><span id="ftn-25"/>In 1996 I published an article, “Dyslexia,” in <i>Scientific American.</i> In response, I heard from every part of the globe—Africa, Italy, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Israel, Thailand, England, Argentina—about children and adults experiencing problems exactly like those described in the article. Diplomats, scientists (including Nobel laureates), and CEOs have all told me about their difficulties with reading. Furthermore, the first edition of this book has been translated into many languages, including not only alphabetic scripts but also logographic languages such as Japanese, Korean, and traditional Chinese. Figure 1 is a picture of two visitors to the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity from Korean television, including the anchorwoman and a teacher who is dyslexic, who understands the cost of dyslexia and is working to increase public awareness of the condition in Korea. (My husband and colleague, Bennett, and I are also in the photo.) Clearly dyslexia knows no boundaries, neither geographic nor ethnic nor intellectual.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>WE KNOW SOME GIRLS ARE DYSLEXIC</b></h2>
			<p>
				The diagnosis of dyslexia presents a unique set of circumstances. While biologically based, dyslexia is expressed within the context of the classroom, so that its identification often depends on the school system’s understanding of dyslexia. Since most research studies of dyslexic children are based on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32" title="32"/>children who have already been identified by their schools, we wondered if school identification processes might be biased and result in the identification of certain groups of children and the exclusion of others. For example, it had been generally assumed that reading disability was far more common in boys than in girls. Could this be the result of some systematic bias in school identification procedures?</p>
			<p class="indent">The data from the longitudinal study were ideally suited to address our question. First, the sample allowed us to examine a representative sample of children rather than only a school-identified group. Second, since every boy and girl participating in the study received individual ability and achievement tests, we were able to apply the criteria for reading disability set forth in the official school guidelines. In principle, then, our identification and the school’s identification of a reading disability were ostensibly based on the same criteria. Theoretically both groups should comprise the same children. The children were in the second and third grades at the time of testing.</p>
			<p class="indent">As shown in Figure 2, we found that according to school identification procedures, the prevalence of reading disability is three to four times more common in boys than in girls. These findings are in agreement with older reports in which the ratio of boys to girls with reading disability has varied from 2:1 to 5:1. A common thread uniting these past studies is that they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33" title="33"/>were all based on samples identified through either clinic or school identification procedures. <span id="ftn-26"/>In contrast, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of reading disability in boys and girls we identified using our research-based criteria. In general, when each child in a school (or school district) is individually tested, which is what we did, researchers report as many reading-disabled or dyslexic girls as boys. Consistent, too, are findings from still other studies that indicate girls with dyslexia are not as readily identified as boys and in fact are often more severely impaired in reading before they are identified for special education services.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Teachers were asked to complete the Multigrade Inventory for Teachers (MIT), which comprises a series of scales asking about, for example, Attention, Academic Achievement, Fine Motor, Language and Behavior. Analysis of teacher ratings of the children’s behavior revealed why girls are less readily identified than boys. There are significant differences between how teachers rate <i>typical</i> boys and girls. Teachers have incorporated a norm for classroom behavior that reflects the calmer behavior of normal girls. Boys who are a bit rambunctious—although still within the normal range for the behavior of boys—may be perceived as having a behavior problem and referred for further evaluation. Meanwhile, the well-mannered little Jennifers and the shy Tanishas who sit quietly in their seats but who nevertheless are failing to learn to read are often overlooked and never, or only much later, identified as dyslexic by their school systems.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DYSLEXIA OVER TIME</b></h2>
			<p>For many years researchers and educators questioned whether dyslexia represented a developmental lag that children somehow outgrew or whether the disorder represented a more persistent deficit in reading. The question is important, for if dyslexia is simply a lag in reading development—a temporary snag—this difficulty will be outgrown and parents and teachers need not be so concerned about early reading difficulties. On the other hand, if dyslexia is not outgrown, there is real urgency in identifying children early on and, equally important, in ensuring that they receive help as soon as they are identified.</p>
			<p class="indent">Here, too, we were able to use data provided by the Connecticut Longitudinal Study. Using two complementary strategies, we determined decisively that dyslexia is a persistent, chronic condition and that it does not represent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34" title="34"/>a temporary lag in reading development. In one approach we compared individual growth rates in reading skills across grades one through twelve in two groups of readers: one a group of boys and girls who had never experienced any reading problems, the other a group of children who met criteria for dyslexia in the early grades. To no one’s surprise, we observed that both groups increased their reading skills over time. However, and most important, as shown in Figure 3, the gap in reading ability between good and dyslexic readers remains. Dyslexic readers never catch up with their classmates who are good readers. If a child is dyslexic early on in school, that child will continue to experience reading problems.</p>
			<figure class="figure figure_medium_caption">
				<div class="squeeze squeeze80">
					<img alt="" class="image" id="Page_034_img01" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_034_Image_0001.jpg"/>

				<figcaption class="figcaption dynamic_box">
					<p class="figcaption_para" id="fig-3"><i>Figure 3. Dyslexia Is Persistent</i></p>
					<p class="figcaption_para1">Over time, reading performance improves in both good readers (upper curve) and poor readers (lower curve). However, the <i>gap</i> between the two groups remains.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Perhaps of even more interest and of particular relevance, as noted earlier, a more recent (2015) examination of the CLS data revealed that the differences in reading between typical and dyslexic readers not only appear as early as first grade but, importantly, persist through adolescence. These data indicate that <span id="ftn-27"/><i>dyslexic readers do not catch up with typical readers primarily due to large differences observed as early as first grade.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">An important implication of these findings is that if this persistent gap between dyslexic and typical readers is to be narrowed, or even closed, effective reading interventions must be implemented very early, when children are still developing the basics for reading acquisition, such as phonological awareness, letter-sound understanding, and building a lexicon. Implementing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35" title="35"/>effective reading programs early, even in kindergarten, offers the potential to reduce the observed persisting disparities between dyslexic and typical readers. The earliest possible intervention is vital.</p>
			<p class="indent">One final point: About a third of the children in the longitudinal study were receiving special help, but this help was often erratic, occurring sporadically and consisting of what might best be described as a Band-Aid approach to a gushing wound. In general, we found that children received help for very limited periods of time, often from well-meaning but untrained teachers and with methods that did not reflect state-of-the-art, evidence-based instructional strategies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Now that the pernicious nature of dyslexia has been uncovered, we must ensure that our approach to identification and intervention—in terms of age of screening, definition used in identification, intensity and frequency of instruction, and content of instruction—is consistent with the seriousness and emerging scientific knowledge of the disorder. I will now detail what we have learned about the basic nature of dyslexia. This knowledge provides the foundation for the most accurate diagnosis and effective interventions for reading difficulties.</p>
