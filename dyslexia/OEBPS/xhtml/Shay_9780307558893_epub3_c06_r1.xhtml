			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>READING THE BRAIN</b></h1>
			<p>Incredible as it may seem, today we can actually see someone’s brain at work as she reads. Sophisticated imaging studies of the reading brain bring phonemes to life, allowing researchers to virtually track the printed word as it initially registers as a visual icon, then is transformed almost instantly into the sounds (phonemes) of language and simultaneously activates its meaning stored within the brain’s internal dictionary. Within milliseconds—less than the blink of an eye—assorted lines and circles in the brain’s circuitry make the vast journey to meaning, as a cacophony of abstract symbols is translated into a symphony of words. As recently as the beginning of the nineteenth century, scientists and philosophers weren’t even sure that thinking, speaking, or reading had their roots in the brain. We’ve come a long way.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-43"/>The earliest conceptions of the mind were grounded in religious and philosophical notions, often focused on the soul. By the second century, animal experiments were beginning to provide clues to the central importance of the brain. Most influential were the experiments of the Greek physician Galen which demonstrated that the brain was critical for movement, for sensation, and for thinking. This brilliant physician-scientist associated all varieties of higher cognitive activities—memory, imagination, and intelligence—with the brain, and he also related brain injury to disruptions of these processes. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62" title="62"/><span id="ftn-44"/>Galen viewed the brain as a holistic and undifferentiated organ, and this conceptualization reigned virtually unchallenged for hundreds of years.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>LOCALIZING BRAIN FUNCTIONS</b></h2>
			<p>
				In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, physicians took a great interest in the origins of human personality traits as well as mental illness and were eager for a new conceptual framework, one that continues to influence neuroscientists to this day—the fundamental notion that cognitive functions could be localized within specific brain structures. Scientists and physicians had begun trying to localize brain functions using the only method available to them at the time: studying the brains of individuals who had suffered an accident of nature, such as a stroke or a traumatic injury to the brain. After a patient died, examination of the brain revealed the area of injury, which was in turn related to the patient’s symptoms. <span id="ftn-45"/>It was just such a circumstance that allowed the first cognitive process, expressive language, to be localized in the brain.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1861 a fifty-one-year-old Frenchman named Leborgne was transferred to the clinical service of Paul Broca, a highly respected French physician. The long-suffering Leborgne had been hospitalized for at least two decades with a range of neurological ills, including epilepsy, loss of speech, and paralysis of his right side. Leborgne had been nicknamed Tan by the other patients because that was the only word he could say, and he repeated it over and over again. His ability to understand spoken language, however, was relatively unaffected. Leborgne was a patient of Broca’s for less than a week when he passed away. Examining Leborgne’s brain afterward, Broca was at once struck by a rather large irregular lesion on the surface of the left frontal region (the inferior frontal gyrus, to be precise; see Figure 14). Located just behind the left temple, this portion of the brain is now commonly referred to as Broca’s area. Today neurologists classify a loss of language as an aphasia, and the specific kind of language difficulty observed in Leborgne—a loss of fluent speech while retaining the ability to understand language—is known as Broca’s aphasia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Broca’s observation ushered in a new era in brain exploration of cognitive functions. There were to be no more quarrels over the brain’s role in cognition; loss of a highly specific cognitive function—not just any speech problem, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63" title="63"/>but the loss of the ability to express words, for example—was linked to the destruction of a particular brain region. Broca went on to define different types of speech difficulties. For example, he noted that the expressive aphasia he had initially described could be accompanied by retention of the ability to swear. In describing the case of a beleaguered parish priest decades earlier (1843), another physician, Jacques Lordat, had unknowingly provided one of the most striking cases of this dissociation. Following a stroke, the priest could say very few words, but he was able to utter “the most forceful oath of the tongue, which begins with an ‘f’ and which our Dictionaries have never dared to print.”</p>

			<p class="indent">Broca also clearly established that the roots of reading—language and speech—originate in the cerebral cortex.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c06-ftn-1" id="c06-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> As self-evident as this may seem today, the logical source of our ability to speak was long thought to be obvious—the tongue. For example, in ancient Rome, the treatment for the inability to speak was to tone and massage the tongue, like a weak or lazy muscle, and to gargle vigorously. Although perceptive physicians seemed to disentangle <i>loss of speech</i> (aphasia) from <i>loss of movement</i> (paralysis) of the tongue, the view that the tongue was the primary organ for speech was firmly entrenched and lingered through the seventeenth century at least. When <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_64" title="64"/>William Harvey, who had electrified the scientific world with his discovery of the circulation of blood, suffered a stroke in 1651 and was unable to speak, his apothecary provided this renowned physician-scientist with what he considered to be the very best aphasia treatment available. <span id="ftn-46"/>The apothecary crisply clipped Harvey’s frenulum, the thin sliver of tissue tying the tongue to the base of the mouth. The hope was that if his tongue were freed, Harvey’s aphasia would improve. Although we can surmise that Harvey’s tongue was now looser, we can also conclude with great assurance that his aphasia was not improved.</p>
			<p class="indent">The precocious German neurologist Carl Wernicke, who by the age of twenty-six had completed the three-volume <i>Der aphasischer Symptomenkomplex</i> (The Aphasic Symptom Complex), used a combination of astute clinical observation and deductive reasoning to suggest that damage to an area along the upper part of the temporal lobe (the brain region behind the helix of the ear; see Figure 15) would produce still another type of aphasia. This speech disturbance, now referred to as Wernicke’s aphasia, was almost the inverse of the expressive aphasia localized by Broca. Instead of the patient failing to get the words out but usually fully understanding language, in Wernicke’s aphasia the patient speaks with ease but does not understand language and utters gibberish.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65" title="65"/><b>HOW THE BRAIN READS</b></h2>
			<p>Broca’s discovery opened the door to learning how the brain reads. Remember, in order to read we must enter the language system; at a neural level, this means that reading relies on the brain circuits already in place for language. Although not appreciated at the time, the identification of Broca’s area as a site critical for language marked the first step in the quest to map out the neural circuitry for reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">The strategy used by Broca and legions of neurologists afterward was straightforward. After a patient passed away, areas of damaged tissue were identified, localized according to anatomic landmarks, and correlated with the patient’s symptoms. It is important to appreciate what this type of evidence can tell us as well as its limitations. To pinpoint a site that disrupts the circuitry for spoken language is not quite the same as mapping out the neural machinery responsible for language. Broca’s contemporary, British neurologist John Hughlings Jackson, appreciated this distinction when he said, “To locate the damage which destroys speech and to locate speech are two different things.” Let’s say an adult suddenly loses his ability to read. His condition, acquired alexia, typically follows a stroke, in which destruction of brain tissue produces a break in the circuitry and, one could say, causes a power outage that interrupts the pathway for reading. The wiring, originally laid down correctly, is now disrupted. Locating the area of disruption tells us that this is an area that is necessary for reading, but it doesn’t identify the complete neural circuitry responsible for reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the condition of developmental dyslexia, where reading fails to develop normally, something has gone awry right from the beginning. Consequently, we would <i>not</i> necessarily expect to find a distinct lesion, a cut in the wiring; instead, the wiring may not have been laid down correctly in the first place, a glitch having taken place during fetal or early life, when the brain is hard-wired for language. As a result, the tens of thousands of neurons carrying the phonologic messages necessary for language do not appropriately coalesce to form the resonating networks that make skilled reading possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">The enormous complexity of the brain in its initial development presents a myriad of opportunities for a misconnection or a false connection. In this case, the neural system necessary for phonologic analysis is somehow miswired and a child is left with a phonologic impairment that interferes with spoken and written language. Depending on the nature or severity of this fault in the wiring, we would expect to observe variations and varying degrees of reading difficulty.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66" title="66"/>But there are many possible scenarios for developmental dyslexia. What was needed to understand dyslexia is the ability to map out the full neural circuitry for reading. That was achieved in the 1980s. In the interim, physicians tried to make sense of dyslexia in the best way they could. Hypotheses offered by the American neurologist Norman Geschwind that dyslexia results from damage to or improper development of language regions in fetal life played an important role in focusing attention on the neurobiological substrate of dyslexia.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>A REVOLUTION: READING THE MIND</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-47"/>In 1973, with the advent of computed tomography (CT, which is a computed series of X-rays that build up a three-dimensional image of the brain), scientists could now <i>see</i> the brain for the first time. For this groundbreaking achievement, the British scientists Godfrey N. Hounsfield and Allan M. Cormack were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1979.</p>
			<p class="indent">Using CT and, later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is discussed below, neuroscientists could see the finest details of brain anatomy. These pictures, however, provide information about structure and not about function. It wasn’t until functional brain imaging became possible in the early 1980s that scientists were able to see the brain at work in a healthy person. Brain <i>function</i> could be observed as a person read, spoke, thought, or imagined.</p>
			<p class="indent">Positron emission tomography (PET) was the first technology developed to study the brain at work. It involves measuring blood flow to brain regions through the use of a radioactive compound injected into the bloodstream. Though much has been and continues to be learned about brain function from this technology, it is hampered by its invasive nature and the elaborate equipment required to make up the radioactive materials. So for the most part PET has been supplanted by a newer technology, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allows neuroscientists to visualize the inner workings of the human brain in a completely noninvasive way; there is no radiation, nor are there any injections. Currently fMRI is the most widely used method to study the brain at work.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the seminal paper “On the Regulation of the Blood Supply of the Brain,” published in 1890 in the <i>Journal of Physiology,</i> British scientists C. S. Roy and C. S. Sherrington argued for the principle of <i>autoregulation of cerebral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67" title="67"/>blood flow.</i> Basically, they provided evidence that within the brain, local blood supply varies in response to functional activity in that region. In their own words: <span id="ftn-48"/>“These facts seem to indicate to us the existence of an automatic mechanism by which the blood supply of any part of the cerebral tissue is varied in accordance with the activity of the chemical changes which underlie the functional activity of that part.”</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1981, Louis Sokoloff, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health, showed that it is changes in energy metabolism that directly influence alterations in blood flow: <span id="ftn-49"/>“It is, therefore, clear…that energy metabolism and functional activity are closely coupled in the nervous system and that local blood flow is distributed and adjusted in the cerebral tissues according to local metabolic demand and thereby to local functional activity.”</p>
			<p class="indent">This makes it possible to envision the sequence of events at the associated brain region as a person reads: increase in functional activity of local neurons → increase in local metabolism → increase in local blood flow.</p>
			<p class="indent">This concatenation of brain events makes sense. Performing a cognitive task like reading is work and consumes energy. As a child tries to determine whether two words rhyme, a chain of events is set in motion: The neural systems necessary for carrying out this task are turned on and consume energy, and to meet the increased energy requirement more blood flow is needed to bring additional fuel (oxygen) and nutrients to that location. This concept—the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow—is the underlying principle of functional brain imaging. This principle, together with the fact that increased blood flow produces alterations in the magnetic properties of blood, is what underlies the functioning of fMRI.</p>
			<p class="indent">Functional MRI is based on the magnetic properties of a basic component of blood: oxygenated hemoglobin. In red blood cells, oxygen is bound to hemoglobin and transported throughout the body for delivery to working cells. The magnetic properties of the hemoglobin molecule change depending on the amount of oxygen bound to it. Blood with higher oxygen concentrations produces a stronger magnetic signal than blood with less oxygen. As a person carries out a specific cognitive task, responsible neurons in sites distributed throughout the brain become activated, blood flow to these brain regions increases, bringing with it rich, highly oxygenated blood, and the fMRI apparatus picks up its stronger magnetic signal.</p>
			<p class="indent">Now you will learn how fMRI experiments are carried out and what fMRI is teaching us about how the brain reads.</p>
