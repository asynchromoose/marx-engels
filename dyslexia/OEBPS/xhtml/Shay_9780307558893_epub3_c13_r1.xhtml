			<p>
				As you read, Andrew was diagnosed as dyslexic after he had suffered years of frustration and had fallen further and further behind his peers. This destructive holding pattern—failing in reading, but also failing to have it recognized—is absolutely unnecessary for children with dyslexia. Today it is possible to reliably identify boys and girls at high risk for dyslexia <i>before</i> they fall behind.</p>
			<p class="indent">Earlier I discussed the general clues to dyslexia. The focus here is the specific assessment approaches that help to identify potential dyslexia in a young child—the <i>screening</i> instruments designed to identify children most <i>at-risk</i> for dyslexia. The goal, of course, is to catch the potential difficulties before they become full-fledged problems and begin to harm the child.</p>
			<p class="indent">Over the last two decades reading researchers have been trying to develop fast, efficient screeners to be able to identify at-risk children as early as kindergarten or first grade. A screener is not a diagnostic instrument; its role is to quickly and efficiently identify those children <i>at-risk</i> for dyslexia. Screeners are designed to be given to all children in the earliest grades, a process referred to as universal screening. In order to target those children who need extra help as early as possible, the screeners must be able to pinpoint the children who actually will develop dyslexia (referred to as “true positives”) while designating which children definitely will not develop dyslexia (referred to as “true negatives”).</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170" title="170"/><span id="ftn-101"/>Researchers like myself have recognized that one source of screening information that has been ignored is the <i>child’s teacher’s insights and judgment about the child’s reading.</i> In the beginning grades teachers have ample opportunity to observe their students over a substantial period of time as the students engage in relevant learning contexts. They are ideally situated to assess the early language and academic behaviors indicative of high risk for dyslexia in their students. Given the often vastly differing preschool experiences of children and where they are on the reading continuum when they first enter school, it is best to wait until the second semester before screening. At this point the teacher’s insights and judgment about the child’s reading are an important source of information. It is the child’s teacher who has spent months closely working with him and observing the daily ups and downs, the frightening frustrations, and the satisfied smiles that are all part of the process of becoming a reader. These experiences are reflected in the teacher’s responses on the screening measure. Too often his or her unique insights and depth of experience are underutilized. This is unfortunate, and we hope it will change.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-102"/>We found that using the teachers’ responses to a small subset of questions (comprising ten items from kindergarten, twelve items from first grade, ten items from second grade, and ten items from third grade) from the Multigrade Inventory for Teachers (MIT) developed at our Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity allowed them and us to predict children at high risk for dyslexia with a high degree of accuracy. <span id="ftn-103"/>This screener, the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ (Pearson, 2016; Figure 38), has a number of significant advantages compared to other screening measures: It engages the teacher, captures his or her insights about the child, is extremely efficient, is very inexpensive, is completed by the teacher who knows the child, and has very good psychometric characteristics. The screener is completed on a tablet, which reveals the results—“at-risk for dyslexia” or “not-at-risk for dyslexia”—almost immediately. Most important, this screener is evidence-based—it has been demonstrated to work. Furthermore, it does not take children away from precious <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171" title="171"/>instructional time. Indeed, the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ is enthusiastically being used nationally in diverse locations, including Palo Alto, California, the state of Missouri, and Brooklyn, New York.</p>

			<p class="indent">For the child identified as <i>at-risk,</i> there are two possible pathways: (1) immediately being placed in an intense early intervention program, or (2) having a full diagnostic assessment. I strongly recommend the latter. A diagnosis is critical for ensuring that the child receives the most appropriate intervention. A diagnosis also allows the student, his family, and his teacher to understand and be able to address his needs as a dyslexic child. For those children who are screened and identified as not being at-risk, parents and teachers can follow what should be an evidence-based reading curriculum, monitoring their child’s progress.</p>
			<p class="indent">An evaluation of the skills (especially phonologic) known to be related to reading success is appropriate for preschool, kindergarten, and first-grade children who are identified as being at-risk for dyslexia and is carried out on an individual basis by a professional who is knowledgeable about reading and dyslexia: a speech and language pathologist, a learning disabilities specialist, a reading specialist, an experienced psychologist, or even a teacher trained to recognize and understand dyslexia and to administer the tests.</p>
			<p class="indent">Pardon my repetition of something I said earlier, but it is terribly important: <span id="ftn-104"/>New data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study indicate that dyslexic readers are reading far below their typically reading peers as early as first grade, and that this gap persists into adolescence and most likely beyond. If we are to close the reading gap between dyslexic and typical readers, we must implement effective reading programs as early as possible, ideally in kindergarten and no later than first grade.</p>
			<p class="indent">Research has opened our eyes to how important it is to have phonologic skills in place during the very first years of school. To repeat: By the end of first grade, most children have just about mastered their basic phonological skills. From second grade on, a child’s development of these competencies is more a matter of refining and gaining efficiency or automaticity in the phonological skills he previously acquired.</p>
			<p class="indent">Phonological sensitivity refers to the ability to focus on the sounds rather than on the meaning of spoken words. The child can tell you what word rhymes with <i>cat</i> rather than simply whether a cat is a kind of animal. Beginning at about age four, phonologic skills develop gradually over time and in a predictable, logical sequence. Awareness of this sequence and its timing makes it possible to recognize when a child is veering off course and get her back on track before any serious damage is done.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172" title="172"/>In describing a child’s phonologic skills, two terms are often used. <i>Phonologic</i> awareness is a general and more inclusive term that includes all levels of awareness of the sound structure of words. It is also used to refer to the earliest stages of developing an awareness of the parts of words, including sensitivity to rhyme and noticing larger parts of words, such as syllables. <i>Phonemic</i> awareness is a much more specific term and refers to the more advanced ability to notice, identify, think about, and manipulate the smallest particles of language making up a word: phonemes. Phonemic awareness has the strongest relationship to later reading, and most tests focus on it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-105"/>Most clinicians and researchers have come to depend on the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing to test for the full range of phonological skills. The second edition now covers the four- to six-year-old range, an improvement over the first edition, which was normed down only to age five.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though not as robust as tests of phonological awareness in predicting whether the young child is at-risk for dyslexia, a child’s knowledge of letter names and sounds may also serve as a helpful guide to how ready to read she is. Testing letter knowledge is straightforward; it can be done informally by asking the child to name letters presented one at a time on a card. Similarly, knowledge of letters and sounds is tested by asking the child, “Can you tell me the sound(s) this letter makes in words?” Using a reading test that contains a letter-identification section—for example, the letter-word subtest on the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement-IV—is more formal.</p>
			<p class="indent">To reiterate, teachers are critical in identifying who may be dyslexic. As I noted, using the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™, we found that the end-of-year kindergarten and end-of-year first-grade teachers’ ratings were able to identify with a high degree of accuracy which children would later be diagnosed as having dyslexia.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WHAT A PARENT CAN DO</b></h2>
			<p>Here is what I believe to be the most scientifically sound and sensible approach to identifying young children at-risk for dyslexia before they experience reading failure:</p>

Be on the alert for problems in rhyming, pronunciation, and word finding (detailed on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c09_r1.xhtml#page_111">this page</a>).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173" title="173"/>Know your family history: Be alert to problems in speaking, reading, writing, spelling, or learning a foreign language. Some families with more than the average complement of dyslexics seem to have an abundance of photographers, artists, engineers, architects, scientists, and physicians (psychiatrists and radiologists). Somewhat less frequent but still impressive are the large number of families sprinkled with great writers, entrepreneurs, and jurists who are dyslexic.</p>

				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> I am often asked about delaying kindergarten for a child with indications that he may have reading difficulties. <span id="ftn-106"/><i>I strongly recommend not delaying kindergarten entry;</i> this will only delay needed help. While many parents believe that a child will respond better to the demands of kindergarten if he is a year older than his classmates, the evidence says otherwise. A group of researchers took advantage of what was in essence a natural experiment to test whether it was biological maturity or exposure to reading instruction that most influenced early reading. The researchers compared two groups of young children who were hovering on either side of the cutoff date for kindergarten entry. One group had birth dates that allowed them to begin kindergarten. A second group was similar in every way except they just missed the cutoff for kindergarten entry. They were a month younger and had to wait a year before starting. When tested later, those in the group that entered kindergarten were reading better than the delayed-entry group. They were also better off academically and emotionally. (In first grade, early starters do better, too.) Staying back did not help the children in their learning and seemed to carry an additional negative psychological burden.</p>
				<p class="indent">This should come as no surprise. Earlier I discussed data indicating that there is no such thing as a developmental lag. If a child is experiencing a problem in reading, it is not going to get better by allowing more time to pass before he receives the appropriate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174" title="174"/>help; he needs an evidence-based intervention. <i>Instruction that fails a child once is not going to help him a second time around.</i> So the evidence comes out strongly against retention. Keep in mind that if dyslexia is caught early and the child receives effective intervention, she can begin to catch up. In contrast, a child who is delayed in receiving such instruction has great difficulty in narrowing the gap, not to mention seeing herself as a success in school.</p>
				<p class="indent">The evidence seems clear that delaying a child’s entry to school does not help him become a better reader. On the other hand, early identification, when linked to effective programs of intervention, can make a difference. Such intervention can help to insure that the vast majority of children at-risk for dyslexia will never have to experience the trauma of prolonged reading failure. <i>Rather than age or “maturity,” it is reading instruction that leads to better reading.</i> Good help is available now as never before.</p>
