			<p>If what I write here is already familiar to you, please bear with me: I feel accommodations are so vitally important to the dyslexic reader that what I say about them bears repeating.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-184"/>If you are a dyslexic reader, accommodations represent the bridge that connects you to your strengths and in the process allows you to reach your full potential. By themselves, accommodations do not produce success; they are the catalysts for success. They grow in importance as a dyslexic progresses in his schooling. As he advances, his strengths—in thinking, in reasoning, in vocabulary, and in analytic skills—mature. At the same time, his academic challenges increase as well. Consequently, with time it becomes even more crucial for the dyslexic reader to access his strengths in order to compensate for his phonologic weakness.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>EXTRA TIME</b></h3>
			<p><i>The most critical accommodation for the dyslexic reader is the provision of extra time.</i></p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Dyslexia robs a person of time; accommodations return it.</i></p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_439" title="439"/>Studies carried out over the last two decades confirm a dyslexic reader’s absolute <i>physiological</i> need for extra time. For him, additional time is obligatory, not optional. It is the dyslexic’s unique constitution that makes it possible for extra time to exert a positive effect.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>For the dyslexic reader, learning capacity is intact; he simply needs time to access it.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Accumulating scientific evidence shows that typical readers and dyslexic readers follow very different pathways to adult reading. For typical readers the route is smooth and orderly: Their phonologic skills increase with age, they become more accurate and more automatic in their reading, and they generally identify words without any need to rely on context around the words. By fourth grade typical readers are no longer using context to figure out a word. The dyslexic, however, must take an alternate, indirect, and demanding route. This secondary pathway will get him to the same destination, but it will take a lot longer. He learns to read accurately, but to achieve the same level of reading as his nondyslexic classmate, he must read much more slowly and with greater effort. The automatic route to reading is unavailable to him. Consequently, if he is to identify many of the words on the page, he must pause and rely on the support of his higher-level thinking skills. He must survey the context and get to the word’s meaning by this slower and more indirect pathway.</p>
			<p class="indent">David Boies is, as I’ve said, dyslexic. He tries not to rely on notes in court, because he is not automatic in his reading. If he were to need to refer to his notes, he would not be able to capture the words on paper instantly; he would need time. This is the imprint of a lack of automaticity in reading. For others, that lack sometimes manifests itself in unexpected ways. For example, John Irving finds it frustrating that he cannot rapidly locate his flight on the departure monitor in an airport, though he tries very hard.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I look at that thing and I am the only one who is competitive about it. I think, <i>God damn it, I’m going to find that city and flight and gate number before [my wife] Janet….</i> I’m just killing myself to find the flight to Dusseldorf or Paris or Helsinki and Janet will look up and say, “Oh, it’s B-9,” like that. Instantly. I can’t do that.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>What his wife, an automatic reader, can do at a glance, Irving, a dyslexic, must do manually, and therefore much more slowly.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_440" title="440"/><b>EXTRA TIME AND THE NEED FOR QUIET</b></h3>
			<p>
				Brain imaging studies have provided us with a new level of understanding of the path dyslexic readers must take. To review briefly, when typical readers encounter a word, they automatically integrate all its features: the way the word sounds (phonology), the way the word looks (orthography), and the meaning of the word (semantics). For dyslexic readers there is inefficient functioning, particularly of those systems in the left occipito-temporal region, the word form area, and as a result dyslexics have to resort to slower, less efficient neural pathways to manually figure out the word and get to its meaning. This process takes much longer and consumes a great deal of energy. As I mentioned earlier, the results of brain imaging studies of children and adults show different brain activation patterns in dyslexic and typical readers, a pattern referred to as the neural signature of dyslexia (see Figure 23, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page_78">this page</a>). Instead of the distinct activation observed in the back of the left side of the brain in typical readers, dyslexic readers demonstrate an inefficient functioning in that region, with activation seen in the left and right frontal regions as well as the right posterior region (see Figure 25, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page_80">this page</a>). An auxiliary team of neural systems is trying to take over for the inefficient primary reading system, and it requires extra time. Dyslexic adults who are able to achieve average levels of accuracy have to do so by resorting to these backup, slower, secondary neural routes to reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">From these and other studies of students, older adults, and children, we know that, as Maggie Bruck, currently a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School, said, <span id="ftn-185"/>“The patterns of deficits that characterize dyslexic children are the very same patterns that characterize adults with these childhood histories. Despite the fact that many of the students have been educationally successful, and despite the fact that as adults they have increased their level of word recognition skills, these data suggest that the primary deficits have not dissipated.” <span id="ftn-186"/>Brain imaging studies in adults with dyslexia confirm Bruck’s clinical observations.</p>
			<p class="indent">Studies of university students who are accurate but slow readers—in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy—indicate that the phonologic deficit and the inefficient neural function persist. So, as shown in Figure 26, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page_82">this page</a> if the dyslexic reader is going to decipher the print before him, he will have to rely on higher-level sources of knowledge—vocabulary and reasoning—and slower, secondary neural pathways for reading. The equation for adult readers who are dyslexic goes something like this: <i>higher-level thinking skills + context + extra time = meaning.</i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_441" title="441"/>The bright dyslexic reader’s reliance on context is both absolute and unique. Children who are poor readers but not dyslexic—for example, those who have across-the-board language difficulties—are generally not benefited by context. They do not possess the verbal skills, particularly the vocabulary and reasoning skills, necessary to help identify unknown words. It is only the dyslexic who possesses a sea of strengths she can apply to the surrounding context to help figure out the mystery word. Since the direct route to meaning is not available to a dyslexic reader, he must apply his intelligence, vocabulary, and reasoning to the context around the unknown word in order to get to its meaning. This means taking a secondary reading pathway that requires extra time.</p>
			<p class="indent">Highly able dyslexic readers have the desire to go on to higher education, but they face the barrier of timed standardized tests, on which they more often than not perform poorly in relation to their knowledge and ability. As I said earlier, they are particularly penalized by timed multiple-choice exams, which typically provide sparse context and time constraints. These tests are not a fair measure of a dyslexic individual’s ability but rather a measure of his disability (see Figure 49).</p>
			<p class="indent">John Irving and the late Stephen J. Cannell, another writer, both scored poorly on the verbal SAT. The renowned academic physicians Dr. Delos Cosgrove and the late Dr. Graeme Hammond scored so low on their Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) examinations that if not for unique circumstances in each of their cases, neither would have been admitted to medical school. David Boies and the financier Charles Schwab join the illustrious <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_442" title="442"/>circle of highly gifted individuals whose performance on timed standardized tests vastly underestimated their abilities and almost kept each from pursuing and succeeding in his life’s ambition. Dr. Carol Greider also had an underwhelming score on her GREs, which resulted in her acceptance by just two of the thirteen graduate programs to which she applied. She carried out her Nobel Prize–winning research during her graduate years at UC Berkeley. Apparently, as you read earlier, the admissions team there wisely saw qualities in Dr. Greider that were missed by the other program administrators, who were blinded by her low GRE scores.</p>

			<h3 class="head"><b>SATISFYING THE GOALS OF A FOREIGN-LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT</b></h3>
			<p>You know by now that students who are dyslexic struggle with foreign languages. Since these students have yet to master the basic phonology of the language they have been immersed in since birth, they are hardly likely to become proficient in a new language when they are young adults. In secondary school, students can, and often do, slip by through rote memorization, diligence, and pleasant personalities, receiving passing grades without having the slightest ability to converse in that language. But in college students are expected to become proficient in a language, able to converse in it and read its literature.</p>
			<p class="indent">At times students will come to realize the futility of their quest and request a partial waiver of the foreign-language proficiency requirement. Alternatively, an experienced instructor may be the first to appreciate the degree of a student’s difficulties and recommend a waiver. As noted earlier, at Yale, after careful review, a partial waiver may be granted with the stipulation that the student is expected to take six course credits in the study of the culture, history, politics, or literature of any specific non-English-speaking culture or society. This model policy reaffirms the importance the university places on the foreign-language requirement and its desire to have students meet the spirit of the requirement rather than solely pass a course. This is a very useful and proper accommodation. Furthermore, it prevents needless suffering and waste of a student’s time and energy while allowing him to focus on courses he has a chance of mastering.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DIGITIZED TEXTS</b></h3>
			<p>Just how helpful it is for dyslexic students to be able to listen to digitized or recorded text is exemplified by stories of dyslexic students who endured years of struggle before they began using text-to-speech technology. For example, as one relieved dyslexic college senior explained:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_443" title="443"/>I could remember just about everything I heard, but read too slowly to keep up, and so much effort was put into trying to get the words out that I had little comprehension afterwards. Once I began using text-to-speech technology, everything changed. I started to feel much better about myself. I really was learning the material and I no longer made excuses to avoid doing my work because it made me feel bad. The audio changed my life. For the first time ever, I got straight A’s.</p>
				\
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Beyond schoolwork, dyslexia tears at the independence of the maturing adolescent. Having his texts digitized and available for text-to-speech technology helps give the student back his sense of independence. Accordingly, once a dyslexic child is in middle school or high school, plans should be made to have his textbooks digitized. Listening to the digitized books allows the student to participate in courses and to study at his level of understanding rather than be held back by his slow reading. Furthermore, digitized texts and text-to-speech technology introduce him to vocabulary words that he may not have encountered in his otherwise limited reading. Listening and following along with the text in front of him allows a student to actively dig into his reading, underlining, taking notes, and highlighting—important reinforcement activities that were never even considered when he was totally focused on deciphering the words on the page.</p>
			<p class="indent">Building a bridge to success for the maturing dyslexic student requires three basic ingredients:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Extra time and a quiet, separate room for examinations</i></p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">In addition, there are other useful accommodations:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Alternative testing formats</i> (short essays, oral reports, projects)</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Reliance on visualization</i> (figures, graphs, illustrations) rather than print alone</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Courses and grading that emphasize concepts versus isolated details</i> (content versus form).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_444" title="444"/>To offer practical guidance for integrating these and other accommodations into a student’s educational program, I am going to focus on Stephen and Gregory and on the plans I developed for each of them.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>STEPHEN’S PLAN (HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE)</b></h2>
			<p>Stephen Bennett was fifteen years old and about to enter his freshman year of high school. After he was evaluated at the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity and diagnosed as dyslexic, I met with him and his parents and explained his diagnosis. For adolescents like Stephen who will soon be expected to function independently while attending college, it is particularly important to understand at a very basic level what dyslexia is and how it might affect his everyday life. Gaining this awareness and knowledge, Stephen would be better equipped to figure out how to deal with the impact of his dyslexia in a range of situations. He would gain autonomy and in the process become a powerful advocate for his own needs.</p>
			<p class="indent">I gave Stephen the following summary outlining the predictable consequences of dyslexia and the most appropriate accommodations for each. Because students who are dyslexic learn best by first understanding the big picture, I began by providing Stephen with a conceptual framework summarizing the overall rationale and goals of the plan.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Understand how you learn: your strengths and your weaknesses.</i> Visualize an encapsulated, circumscribed phonological weakness surrounded by a soaring sea of strengths (excellent reasoning skills, vocabulary, the ability to understand concepts).</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Remember the goal: Maximize your strengths, minimize your weakness.</i> Your plan is based on understanding that dyslexia is a problem accessing the basic sounds of spoken language that affects reading, writing, and speaking. Here are the five basic consequences of dyslexia for you and what you should do about each.</p>
				<h3 class="head"><b>1. READING IS SLOW AND LABORIOUS</b></h3>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Request extra time on examinations.</i> Extra time on examinations is a necessity. The amount of time cannot <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_445" title="445"/>be determined from testing; it should be based on your own real-life experience. When you first request this accommodation, request time and a half. Based on how well this works for you, you can request more or less time on subsequent occasions. Since your decoding skills are not automatic, it takes you longer to read each word. In addition, many bright dyslexics like yourself use the context of a paragraph to help them identify a word that they cannot automatically decode. (See Figure 49.) This allows them to fill in what the unknown word probably means, even if they can’t pronounce it. This indirect route to word meaning takes extra time. You absolutely need this extra time if you are to show what you really know. <i>Never feel guilty about requesting extra time. A dyslexic needs extra time just as a diabetic requires insulin.</i> A quiet, separate room and earbuds help to minimize distractions and allow you to concentrate as you read the test questions. Although you read words slowly, your comprehension is at a high level, because you can apply your skills in vocabulary and in thinking to figure out the meaning of a passage.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Avoid taking too many courses with large volumes of reading.</i> You should limit yourself to no more than two <i>reading</i> courses per semester. If necessary, when in high school take summer courses. When you begin college, try to take a reduced course load the first semester (or even the first year), until you adjust to the academic and other demands of university life. You can take college summer courses or a fifth year in college as well.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Pace yourself when you read.</i> Read for twenty minutes, take a break, exercise, return to your reading. Since your reading is fragile, read in a quiet room. As noted previously, rather than being an <i>automatic</i> reader, you are a so-called <i>manual</i> reader who must use up large amounts of attention during reading. Listening to background music such as jazz or classical—as long as it does not have lyrics—helps to block out or mask any distractions.</p>

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_446" title="446"/><i>Getting the Most Information from What You Read.</i> Many students do not know how to get the most information out of a passage they are assigned to read; they focus on all the details and remember few. But one approach to getting the most out of reading has worked for many students: encouraging <i>active</i> reading, which is the basis of remembering what you have read. This approach is called SQ3R. Each letter stands for a process that will help in your reading:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>S—Survey.</i> Look over the chapter before you read it. Look at the title and subheadings of each section; read the introduction and the summary at the end. It helps to know what to expect from your reading. This puts you into a mindset for receiving the information.</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>Q</i>—<i>Question.</i> Change the headings into questions and then let these questions guide your reading. For example, in a biology textbook, if the section heading is “Functions of the Stomach,” change that to “What are the functions of the stomach?”</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>R—Read.</i> Read the text to search for answers to the questions you have created. Highlighting or underlining the key sentences helps you to recall the information. Taking <i>brief</i> notes on the highlights of each section will also help you to remember the important points.</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>R—Recite.</i> Say your answers out loud.</p>
				<p class="indent"><i>R—Review.</i> After completing a section, go over the main points of your highlighted sections or your notes by reciting the information out loud and making sure you are correct.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">This very simple process will help you organize your reading and gain more from it. There are other aids:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Dyslexic students frequently find <i>taking short notes on the computer</i> very helpful in their studying. In fact, many distill things even more, taking notes on their notes until they are left with a very small number of notes. Rewriting the notes is helpful in remembering and also creates a concise, abbreviated set of notes from which to study for a future examination. Choose from the several helpful note-taking apps (OneNote, Evernote, Notability, Livescribe).</p>
				<p class="list0 spaceabove"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_447" title="447"/><i>Active learning</i> along with <i>repetition and practice</i> is the key to remembering. Actively engaging with the material by highlighting, underlining, and even enlarging the print, if it is on a computer, are all helpful in making the material salient to you. Explaining or rephrasing specific ideas or concepts to yourself aloud and reading your notes aloud over and over again help you to keep information in your memory and to retrieve it when needed. Visualizing what you read may be especially helpful to you. Creating an exaggerated or ridiculous visual image, or any image that is meaningful to you in some way, will aid your memory. All these suggestions are consistent with current thinking about reading comprehension, which emphasizes that the goal of reading is not just to repeat by rote what the writer says but to go deeper into the text so that the reader makes inferential interpretations of what will happen and why. It is a good idea as you read to ask yourself questions having to do with your predictions of what will happen and what makes you think so.</p>
				<p class="list0 spaceabove"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Obtain books in digitized form.</i> Obtain digitized versions of your textbooks from libraries such as Bookshare and Learning Ally. In college, have them scanned in by your resource office for disabilities. Ask your instructor for a book list <i>before</i> the start of the semester so that you can be sure of having the text digitized in time for class. Use text-to-speech software to listen to as you read the text. Hearing and seeing the words help you to pronounce and to remember difficult words. Listen actively. For example, you can highlight and underline important parts as you read along. Do the same for pleasure reading. This way you can get to enjoy the stories and literature you might not read in their printed form. Magazines are also available.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Modern text-to-speech programs allow you to select the rate at which the text is read and select words, sentences, and paragraphs to highlight. Options are available to change the font style, increase the white space between lines, and move the text around. A search function enables you to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_448" title="448"/>rapidly locate a particular word within the text. Specific sections of a text can be clipped out and saved as a separate text file. In addition, these programs provide bookmarks, dictionary functions, voice notes (you can dictate short notes attached to specific text sections and play them back when needed), and spell-checkers and will create an outline from any text. They also link up to and read Web-based emails and other Internet text.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Speech-to-text programs have options to read aloud and pronounce words that you have said or typed, so you can make sure you typed the word you intended. Other options include homonym support; for example, if you wrote, “I want to <i>heel</i> the sick,” the program will read aloud the definition of <i>heel</i> and provide the spelling and definition of other like-sounding words. Once you see and hear the word <i>heal</i> read aloud with its definition, you can correct your spelling. There is a learning curve associated with text-to-speech and speech-to-text programs, and it may be helpful to locate someone you can turn to for expert advice.</p>

			<p><i>Find Alternatives to Reading the Originals.</i> If you have to read a book for a literature class, you might try to find an alternative version. For example, Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> and Theodore Dreiser’s <i>An American Tragedy</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c32-ftn-1" id="c32-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> have been made into movies. Many students know that a very useful website for movies is <a href="http://www.imdb.com">www.imdb.com</a>, which provides a complete catalogue of just about every film ever made so that you can check to see if an assigned book has been made into a movie. (Ideally you will watch the movie version as a preliminary to reading the novel, although there may be times when the text is so difficult or lengthy and your time pressure is so great that you are not able to read the novel in its entirety.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Both Charles Schwab and David Boies told me that they learned a great deal from Classic Comics when they were younger. Now there are graphic novels and other graphic books that can serve the same function as comic books did for these two dyslexic readers.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, a number of other options are available to the dyslexic reader. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_449" title="449"/>For example, earlier I mentioned materials referred to as high interest, low readability, such as the Oxford School Shakespeare series available from Amazon. This series includes not only the complete Shakespeare plays but also clear explanations of difficult words and passages, a synopsis of the plot, summaries of individual scenes, and notes on the main characters. A similar series, Streamlined Shakespeare, is available from the publisher Gander (and via Amazon) and features works of Shakespeare rewritten so that someone reading at a fourth-grade level or higher will be comfortable. Many other high-interest, low-readability texts are available from a number of publishers, including High Noon Books, a division of Academic Therapy Publications (<a href="http://www.highnoonbooks.com">www.highnoonbooks.com</a>). These series provide increasingly complex reading material in a very user-friendly format, incorporating both fiction and nonfiction. Using Lexia reading levels, your local library staff should be a great source of high-interest books at your readability level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Watch the news on television, listen to it on the radio, and visit museums. In museums you can rent audio guides and listen to minilectures about the art. Even if you don’t read a lot, there are alternative ways to get information and to learn about the world.

Most text-to-speech software includes a dictionary. Many dyslexics get into the habit of using this dictionary to learn not only the meaning of unfamiliar words but their pronunciation as well. This is particularly important in courses such as biology and chemistry, where complex new terms often appear (such as <i>oxidative phosphorylation</i>).</p>

Using new terms in such a dialogue allows you to get to know unfamiliar words and to recognize each more easily the next time you see it in print or hear the word <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_450" title="450"/>in a lecture. You often will remember what you have <i>heard</i> much better than material you have <i>read.</i> In addition, try to join a study group when preparing for a test.

			<h3 class="head"><b>4. GIVING ORAL RESPONSES ON THE SPOT IS SLOW AND LABORED</b></h3>
			<p>
				The same phonologic weakness that affects your reading can also affect your ability to come up with spoken words quickly. Oral language, too, depends on phonologic ability: You must go into your internal dictionary, access the appropriate phonemes, put them in the correct order, and then these will activate the muscles of articulation to form and then express the word. Ironically, the most difficult step, using higher thinking abilities to develop a concept and identify the abstract semantic representation of the word, is not a major problem. Rather it is the lower-level component, accessing and ordering the units of sound that represent the word and programing the articulatory muscles that utter the word, that is the troublesome component. The result is many <i>um</i>’s or misspoken words, along with much embarrassment on the speaker’s part. (See Figure 13, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page_59">this page</a>, and Figure 48, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c30_r1.xhtml#page_422">this page</a>.)</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">If you have these kinds of issues, technically referred to as word-retrieval difficulties, that explains why you cannot come up with the exact answer when called upon in class, even when you think you know the answer. Once you understand the basis for your problems answering oral questions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_453" title="453"/>quickly, you can take steps to remedy the situation. Your teacher is an important partner in this; you must explain to her that your dyslexia impacts how you respond in class. Share the suggestions below with your teacher.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Give Prepared Short Oral Reports Rather Than Instant Oral Responses in Class.</i> Given time, dyslexics can prepare and deliver excellent oral reports. Technology can help in an almost unending number of ways, especially in organizing and delivering such presentations. For example, you can learn to use <i>PowerPoint</i> slides to prepare reports. This allows you to take advantage of your strong visual and thinking skills as well as to use the slides as an aid during the presentation. You will have to practice at home. Preparing a PowerPoint presentation (or simply making an outline on the computer) is also an excellent exercise in organizing large amounts of material and learning how to select the most salient points.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Phonological Slips Should Not Be Mistakenly Interpreted as a Lack of Knowledge.</i> Knowing that you are dyslexic and understanding the impact of dyslexia on you as well as why you are experiencing difficulty can be enormously helpful. For example, if your oral response sounds off the mark, suggest to your teacher that it may be a phonological error and she should consider allowing you to explain. Dyslexics often have difficulty in finding the precise or specific word. You should be asked to elaborate or more fully describe what you are trying to say. Tell your teacher, “I misspoke. Let me explain what I mean.”</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Your Written Work Should Be Graded on Content Rather Than on Form, Especially Spelling.</i> Many dyslexic readers conceptualize at a very high level, but as a result of a phonologic weakness they experience difficulty with handwriting and spelling. The same difficulties decoding words (going from letters to sound) show up when you try to carry out the reverse process, spelling, which relies on encoding sounds and transforming each sound into letters. Because you are unable to encode the exact model of a written word (that is, its spelling), you will also confuse homonyms. You will not notice that you wrote <i>heal</i> for <i>heel</i> or <i>sail</i> for <i>sale.</i> As mentioned earlier, many of the text-to-speech <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_454" title="454"/>and speech-to-text programs offer homonym help. Spell-checkers are also a great help. Even with the clever software packages currently available, it still may be helpful to have someone proofread your written work. Because spelling errors reflect your dyslexia, essays should be graded for content and grades should not be lowered because of spelling errors.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>5. FOR DYSLEXICS, LEARNING IS MOST OFTEN A TOP-DOWN APPROACH, GOING FROM MEANING TO FACTS</b></h3>
			<p>Select courses where the emphasis is on concepts, not on details. You will do much better in courses where the emphasis is on your strengths—understanding broad concepts and ideas, using reasoning and analytic skills—rather than on memorizing isolated bits of information. Rote memory requires strong phonologic abilities. Dyslexics best remember information that is attached to meaning. Before selecting a course, find out if you are expected to memorize specific facts or instead to demonstrate your knowledge through projects and reports. The latter will usually be much better for you. Before the course begins, don’t be afraid to discuss with your instructor how you will be evaluated. Be your own advocate: Explain what you need and why.</p>

			<p>Stephen and his parents met with the principal of his high school and presented the results of my evaluation and recommendations. They were pleasantly surprised by the principal’s positive reaction. He seemed relieved; we had given him a plan of action.</p>
			<p class="indent">The new information produced a significant turnaround for Stephen at school. He and his teachers were surprised and pleased at what a difference extra time and a quiet room made in his test performance. Some of his teachers now offered to provide Stephen with copies of their own lecture notes for him to preview before class, and his classroom contributions improved significantly. He substituted a course in French culture as a partial waiver of the foreign-language requirement. In high school he used his laptop for all his courses and was amazed at how helpful it was to type all his work. Seeing Stephen use his laptop in class resulted in several of his nondyslexic classmates also using laptops. Stephen was pleased, because this made him stand out less. Like many other dyslexics, Stephen wanted more than anything to appear like everyone else and not be noticed.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>GREGORY’S PLAN (MEDICAL SCHOOL)</b></h2>
			<p>
				You already know about Gregory, the bright young man whom I wrote about in <i>Scientific American.</i> He was experiencing frustration in medical school and knew it didn’t have to be that way. I met with the dean of student affairs and told him that a few critical steps would make a significant difference. Operationally, this meant that Gregory’s professors had to recognize and attempt to accommodate rather than penalize Gregory. In words that are now familiar to you, I told the dean that a dyslexic like Gregory cannot provide instant answers, but he can learn and learn very well if given the opportunity to do so. I said it was <i>important to separate the learning process from the evaluative process.</i> For example, during clinical clerkships, a first attempt or response is often regarded as the final evaluation. But Gregory had to be given an opportunity to learn without fear; if he responded hesitantly or incorrectly on the first try, it should not be taken as an indication of a failure to learn. <i>His evaluation must not confuse oral language facility with ability.</i> Accordingly, <i>Gregory must be evaluated on the basis of his knowledge and reasoning skills, not his glibness or speed of verbal response.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">I said that for each course Gregory needed to meet regularly with someone knowledgeable with whom he could preview and talk through the content. This would help overcome his problem with rapidly retrieving words. Faculty members, fellows, senior residents, and retired faculty members have served effectively in this capacity. I said it was critical that this individual <i>not</i> be a part of the evaluative process.</p>
			<p class="indent">I also said it would make a real difference if there was an individual who would function as a faculty advocate and mentor to Gregory, someone who would represent his needs to the clinical course directors. Such a person should be a member of the academic faculty who carries the authority and respect of the institution, has an understanding of the nature and consequences of dyslexia, and is genuinely supportive. Having a respected faculty member run interference for the student makes a world of difference. The student may say the same things but with little effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_456" title="456"/>Finally, I said that the evaluative process must be a reflection of Gregory’s ability and not a measure of his disability. I told the dean about how unfair multiple-choice examinations were for Gregory and why. This had been demonstrated during Gregory’s obstetrics/gynecology rotation. During the six weeks of this course, his performance was observed around the clock by a range of attending doctors and team members; the consensus was that he performed at an honors level. In stark contrast, he failed the multiple-choice written examination—a result he had anticipated and spoken to the course director about. The extreme disparity between his excellent clinical performance on the wards and the multiple-choice examination speaks for itself and clearly documents the inappropriateness of this type of examination to measure Gregory’s knowledge.</p>
			<p class="indent">A dyslexic medical student like Gregory who has had to adapt to and successfully cope with a chronic disability for virtually his entire school career clearly has a great deal to offer as a physician, including many of the most meaningful yet least teachable qualities: compassion, empathy, and sensitivity as well as intelligence and motivation. With the kind of support and understanding I indicated, Gregory would thrive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most of my recommendations were adopted, and Gregory graduated. He was then accepted into a very competitive residency, which he easily completed. He received the accommodation of extra time to take his specialty board certification and is currently director of a large medical unit in his specialty. He reads voraciously, not only professional journals but newspapers and many periodicals, including <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The Economist.</i> All the challenges posed by dyslexia and his overcoming them have made him an exceptionally strong leader. He is both a great problem-solver and fearless.</p>
			<p class="indent">Our new level of understanding of dyslexia (and learning) and of the importance of accommodations is now being transformed—through the requests of individual students, through the insights of perceptive teachers, and through changes in public policy—into real and lasting changes in educational practices and policies. The scientific basis of, the urgent need for, and the life-transforming difference made by the provision of accommodations have been proven and are rapidly taking root in classrooms across the country. As a result of these much-needed adaptations, dyslexic students will now have the opportunity to develop their full potential. Not only will the individuals benefit, but society as a whole will be a winner, too.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_457" title="457"/><b>ANSWERS TO THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT ACCOMMODATIONS</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>HOW IS DYSLEXIA IDENTIFIED IN COLLEGE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS?</b></h3>
			<p>Dyslexia is a clinical diagnosis; it must be made by a clinician who knows the student and who is able to thoughtfully synthesize the pertinent historical information, clinical observations, and results of relevant testing. The diagnosis is based on a pattern of findings; it should never be made or ruled out on the basis of an isolated test result. Tests are just proxies. A person’s lifelong history and the reality of how that individual reads, especially how he reads aloud, should not be neglected.</p>
			<p class="indent">The hallmark of dyslexia is an <i>unexpected difficulty</i> in reading in relation to the person’s other cognitive and academic abilities. In college (and beyond), the most valid approach relies on the person’s accomplishments—academic performance (outstanding grades in math, philosophy, or chemistry), educational status (attending or a graduate of a competitive college, graduate, or professional school), or professional status (attorney, physician, writer, engineer, or successful businesswoman). Within this context, a college student, a law school graduate, or a physician who reads slowly and with great effort is manifesting an unexpected difficulty in reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reading accuracy should not be used as a measure of reading proficiency in a bright, educated adult. By adolescence, a student who is dyslexic often will improve his ability to read words accurately so that measures of word accuracy are expected to be in or to approach the average range. Consequently, the finding of average word-reading skills in an educated adult dyslexic is not very helpful in determining if he is experiencing difficulty in reading. Scientific evidence shows that adults with childhood histories of dyslexia who appear to be able to identify words accurately are reading those same words differently from others; they are reading them more slowly and using different brain systems.</p>
			<p class="indent">Lack of fluency is the only true index of dyslexia in a bright adult. How the person reads <i>aloud</i> is a critical measure of fluency: Does he stumble over words, hesitate, mispronounce, omit, or add words as he reads? Does he read with <i>prosody</i> (expression)? Prosody is a key criterion for fluency, often overlooked and underappreciated. Prosody provides insight into how well the reader <i>understands</i> what he is reading. Does he adjust his reading to reflect the meaning, reading faster or more slowly, raising his voice or whispering, depending on the message being conveyed by the words on the page?</p>
			<h3 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_458" title="458"/><b>ARE THERE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD BE CONFUSED WITH DYSLEXIA?</b></h3>
			<p>In a bright postsecondary school student or an accomplished adult, very few problems can reasonably be confused with dyslexia. If the pattern I have outlined in this book has been established in someone, she is dyslexic. Only dyslexia produces the clinical syndrome characterized by the paradoxical pairing of a phonologic weakness and higher-level cognitive strengths expressing themselves throughout the person’s life. If a person has a history of phonologically based speaking, reading, and spelling difficulties going back to childhood and now reads very slowly despite signs of her cognitive strengths, that person is dyslexic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sometimes ADHD is confused with dyslexia; it shouldn’t be. As you know, dyslexia reflects difficulty getting to the basic sounds of language; ADHD reflects problems with the modulation of attention and activity. The symptoms, the neurobiology, and for the most part the effective treatments differ. However, at times a person who is dyslexic may appear not to be paying attention to her reading because it is so demanding for her to decipher the words on the page. It’s not that she has a primary attention problem but rather that reading, for her, requires an unusual outlay of attention. Having said this, it is important to remember that there is a very large co-occurrence of dyslexia and ADHD. (See <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c30_r1.xhtml#page_425">this page</a> for a more detailed discussion of ADHD and dyslexia.)</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ESTABLISH HOW MUCH EXTRA TIME IS NEEDED FOR AN EXAM BY A PERSON WHO IS DYSLEXIC?</b></h3>
			<p>The only valid gauge is the person’s own life experience. There is absolutely no test that can provide this information. Each accomplished dyslexic has developed her own route around her phonologic deficit. The specific strategies or alternate pathways that she has perfected over the years and found to work for her will determine how much extra time she requires.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>HOW OFTEN SHOULD A PERSON BE TESTED?</b></h3>
			<p>
				Dyslexia is a persistent, lifelong condition; it is not outgrown. Once a student has been identified as dyslexic and has received accommodations, there is no logical reason to believe that there will come a time when he will not require this accommodation for timed tests in order to access his cognitive strengths. Scientific studies have clearly demonstrated that the thread of the phonologic deficit persists throughout a person’s life; imaging studies demonstrate that even so-called compensated dyslexic students continue to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_459" title="459"/>call upon secondary neural routes to read, and these result in reading more slowly than their peers.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>There is absolutely no evidence to indicate that a person who is dyslexic as a child will as an adult magically metamorphose into a person who is a fluent reader and uses traditional primary brain systems for reading. Requests for repeated assessment are without merit. There is no evidence of benefit from asking students past high school who have recently been appropriately assessed and diagnosed as dyslexic to go through the expense and the psychological trauma—and the potential for misinterpretation—of a new series of evaluations.</i></p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Many believe that the request for frequent testing of the dyslexic once he has completed high school represents an artificial barrier raised to discourage students from applying for accommodations. The requirement for additional time for a dyslexic reader is so fundamental that there is no tenable counterargument. There is no plausible rationale for believing that a person who is dyslexic will no longer require extra time.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DO ACCOMMODATIONS POSE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE?</b></h3>
			<p>
				Researchers have compared the performance of dyslexic and typical-reading college students on timed and untimed tests. The results were consistent: <span id="ftn-187"/>Only students diagnosed as dyslexic actually showed a significant improvement in test scores with additional time. Those who worry about the “advantage” of extra time for a person who is dyslexic fail to appreciate that even with additional time, this individual will continue to feel rushed. <i>Extra time is not an advantage; it is an attempt to level the playing field.</i> Even with the additional time, a slow reader will continue to feel at least the same or more time pressure compared to the ordinary reader. No one wants to feel different, including dyslexic boys and girls, and if not absolutely necessary, they would much rather not require accommodations. For the most part, being treated differently brings about embarrassment and shame. Students request and accept accommodations because they have no choice if the exam is to be a measure of their ability rather than their slow reading.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DO PEOPLE FAKE DYSLEXIA JUST TO GET THE PERKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT?</b></h3>
			<p>
				The belief that somehow parents, particularly middle-income parents living in the suburbs, are seeking a diagnosis of dyslexia to gain some imagined <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_460" title="460"/>advantage for their child is insidious, unfounded, and malicious nonsense. Such harmful attitudes create a backlash that is harmful to children who are struggling to learn to read, and to their parents, who are struggling to help them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-188"/>The Blue Ribbon Panel, appointed to examine flagging on accommodation test results for standardized tests (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c33_r1.xhtml#page_485">this page</a>), concluded that <i>rather than overidentification of suburban students as dyslexic, the problem was the relative underidentification of disadvantaged, especially minority, children.</i> The panel strongly urged that the major testing agencies make proactive efforts to inform these disadvantaged dyslexic students of their rights to testing accommodations.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>HOW EARLY SHOULD ACCOMMODATIONS BEGIN?</b></h3>
			<p>Once a child is expected to write, to complete time-consuming class or homework assignments, and/or to take standardized tests, consideration should be given to providing accommodations.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Teachers should be encouraged to grade a student who is dyslexic on the basis of her thinking and not her spelling.</i></p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>If homework seems to go on for hours, the student should be allowed to reduce her homework assignment.</i> For example, she could complete every other question.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Reducing the time required for completing assignments is critical; it is demoralizing and self-defeating for a student in third or fourth grade to spend hour after hour struggling to complete her work at home. While text-to-speech technology is a helpful accommodation for older students, it must be used very cautiously and sparingly in younger children, who must be encouraged to read as much as possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">When providing accommodations, a child’s dignity and sense of privacy must be considered. Providing accommodations most sensibly and most effectively should become part of the planning discussions routinely held within each school, and not carried out as a spur-of-the-moment, and sometimes thoughtless and hugely embarrassing, gesture.</p>

				Because of the all-too-frequent misunderstanding associated with the diagnosis of dyslexia, most adults and children prefer to keep their dyslexia private. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_461" title="461"/><span id="ftn-189"/>In a recent article my associates and I discussed the pros and cons of asking for accommodations in professional school:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>The medical student with dyslexia is frequently faced with what seem to be two very poor choices: if the student self-identifies as having dyslexia and asks for what he physiologically requires—the accommodation of extra time—his instructors and other students might think he is not very smart or is trying to game the system. However, if the student does not self-identify, he will not receive accommodations to which he is entitled by law and will not be able to demonstrate his knowledge.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 class="head"><b>HOW DOES THE NEED FOR ACCOMMODATIONS ON EXAMS INFLUENCE THE KINDS OF WORK THE DYSLEXIC PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO DO ONCE HE IS OUT OF SCHOOL? WILL HE BE ABLE TO DO “THE JOB”?</b></h3>
			<p>Most dyslexics can and do succeed on the job. A dyslexic generally does not have a problem practicing medicine or law or engineering or writing novels or plays—if he can survive the hurdle of timed multiple-choice tests. These tests tap a dyslexic’s weakness.</p>
			<p class="indent">Having said this, dyslexics will be relatively more successful at some occupations than others. The jobs with which they will have difficulties tend to involve dependence on lower-level skills, with very little requirement for higher-level thinking abilities. A person who is dyslexic would not enjoy work entirely centered on clerical or filing duties.</p>
			<p class="indent">In law, the ability to read quickly or to carry out rote mechanical skills is often confused with the ability to think and reason. Early on, few would have predicted that David Boies, who did not learn to read until third grade, would become the leader in a field that seems to be so dependent on reading. Yet Boies’s life experience reinforces the dictum that it is not how fast you read but how well you <i>think</i> that counts. Boies’s approach is to skim through the text until he recognizes what is important; then he slows down, hones in on this material, and carefully reads the critical facts. He has an uncanny ability to grasp exactly what is important. Once he has set his sights on the most meaningful target for further analysis, he can concentrate on this much-reduced volume of material and carefully analyze it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Earlier I mentioned dyslexic physicians, including surgeons, who have thrived. What flies in the face of so much that we assume to be related to surgical expertise is that some of the most renowned surgeons failed anatomy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_462" title="462"/>in medical school. One of those surgeons told me that anatomy as usually taught in the first year of medical school is not related to surgical skill. “It actually has little to do with the practice of surgery,” he told me. “Performance in a first-year anatomy course has more to do with the ability to memorize the names of assorted body parts by rote.” Most surgeons are in agreement that “surgery has to do with thinking, with judgment, with knowing what to do, and not with knowing the names of particular structures.” Hopefully, this information will caution medical educators to be more thoughtful in their career counseling. They should not assume that dyslexic medical students who have trouble memorizing anatomic labels cannot become outstanding surgeons.</p>
			<p class="indent">Slow-reading lawyers, poor-spelling writers, and surgeons who struggled with anatomy in medical school—they all flout conventional wisdom. From these individuals we learn that reading slowly tells nothing about the ability to comprehend, that poor spelling has little to do with one’s ability to write creatively, and that an inability to memorize or rapidly retrieve the names of anatomical structures does not portend one’s skills in operating on those same body parts. Many school advisors would have counseled each one of these individuals against pursuing their chosen career, in which they have found such fulfillment while also contributing to society. I hope that educators and parents alike will encourage children who are dyslexic to pursue their dreams.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>A CAUTIONARY TALE</b></h2>
			<p>I want to share with you what a wonderful young woman, Skye Lucas, whom you met earlier, when she was a yet-to-be-identified dyslexic struggling reader, learned about the importance of accommodations in higher grades. Skye sought to enroll in a high school that had some understanding of dyslexia, especially accommodations. The school she chose had indicated to Skye and her mom during a preselection interview that it was very dyslexia-friendly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Virtually from the moment she arrived at the school, she was struck by how homework-heavy it was. She spoke to her teacher, explaining that she was dyslexic and asking, “What should I do if forty minutes go by and I haven’t finished the reading due for tomorrow?” The response: “Just try to get it done in forty minutes. I don’t see why you wouldn’t.” “That was really <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_463" title="463"/>the first time I noticed that, basically, I was lied to about whether or not this school was actually friendly toward dyslexics about accommodations,” said Skye. (Assurances cannot always be trusted. Parents of dyslexic children must always dig deeply.)</p>
			<p class="indent">Skye was disappointed by the school’s approach to spelling errors on history tests and the like. “Even if I had the correct answer, points were taken off if I spelled <i>separate</i> with an <i>e</i> instead of an <i>a.</i> It was very demoralizing…. I told my teacher, ‘I’m not supposed to get points taken off for spelling. It’s part of my accommodations.’ As soon as I said that, she snapped back at me, ‘Just because it’s part of your accommodation sheet doesn’t mean that I have to give it to you.’ ”</p>
			<p class="indent">For Skye, extra time was critical, and knowing that her school had a policy that students had to request additional time at least two days before the actual exam, she always made sure to do just that. However, other dyslexics at the school at times were so filled with anxiety about their upcoming exam that they occasionally forgot and did not request the accommodation in time. Amazingly and sadly, they were refused additional time, although they had been approved for this accommodation and school personnel knew it was necessary. More often than not, these students could not finish the test and failed. You can only imagine how heartbroken and fearful they became.</p>
			<p class="indent">The school also promised a learning specialist to help Skye, and she was understandably excited about this. “There was a learning specialist in the school—Merle,” said Skye. “Her office was a closet hidden in the art room, separate from the school. It was difficult to get there, and it seemed that this was a covert thing that the school was trying to hide. Predictably, I pretty much had to explain to Merle what dyslexia was as well. This was kind of frightening and a presage of what my school year was going to be like.”</p>
			<p class="indent">This school wasn’t going to work for Skye. The need to memorize dates and facts and to spell words exactly right left this very bright student feeling dumb. She and her family set out to find a school that understood both dyslexia and accommodations. This time they found it: Dwight School in New York City.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					They have a learning center called Quest. It is not in a closet; it’s actually a full room of teachers who work with students, one that is located pretty central, next to classrooms. And best of all was the head of Quest, who really understood and strongly supported accommodations; he also knew how to speak about dyslexia <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_464" title="464"/>and talk with a dyslexic. Both he and the teachers at Dwight weren’t clueless about accommodations; they didn’t try to fight me on accommodations. They were actually very friendly about my accommodations and didn’t make me feel bad about needing them. They were understanding, which really made a difference. I received extra time on testing quizzes and I didn’t have points taken off for spelling. You don’t know how important something like accommodations are until you don’t have them or [they] are given to you with visible resentment.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Skye is precise in what she would tell her old school she wished they knew:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I would tell them that they really need to be more emotionally supportive, especially in understanding what dyslexia is and understanding why a dyslexic would need certain accommodations. When I was at the other school, I really felt emotionally attacked by teachers 24/7. I think I was attacked because of my accommodations. I really feel my current school understands me, not only academically or in terms of accommodations, but also emotionally.</p>

			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_465" title="465"/>Listening to Skye and so many others I have spoken to, there can be no doubt of the critical importance of the school’s understanding of dyslexia and the importance of accommodations, provided with emotional support. Yet even at this new, more understanding school, Skye was advised not to apply to the University of Pennsylvania because she would “never get in.”</p>
			<p class="indent">In the fall of 2017, Skye Lucas entered Penn as a freshman and was invited to become a member of the very special literary space known as the Kelly Writers House. As Skye’s mother, Geralyn, shared with me, “Who ever thought a dyslexic who failed first grade would be recruited to the Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania?”</p>
			<p class="indent">At the beginning of 2018, I was attending a birthday party for one of my grandchildren when my cell phone rang. Much to my happy surprise, it was Skye, who was calling to tell me two things. First, as she has done many times, she shared how she thinks of me very often and how my unwavering confidence in her has made such a positive difference in her life, propelling her to go forward fearlessly, and how my caring so much about her was the subject of her Bat Mitzvah speech. Second, Skye told me that despite her high school counselor’s warning not to apply to Penn because she would never get in and, on the low probability that she were to be admitted, she would never be able to do the work at such a rigorous college, she was doing beautifully at Penn, and she joyfully added that she had received her first-semester grades: Her GPA was a robust 3.8.</p>
			<p class="indent">Skye’s story is one each reader of this book must keep in mind, whether you are dyslexic or a parent or a teacher of a dyslexic student.</p>
