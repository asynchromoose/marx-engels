			<p>
				I want you to meet two of my patients, Alex and Gregory. Alex is ten years old; <span id="ftn-28"/>Gregory, a medical student, just celebrated his twenty-third birthday. Their experiences are typical of children and young adults with dyslexia. You will learn how Alex’s and Gregory’s seemingly diverse symptoms—trouble reading, absolute terror of reading aloud, problems spelling, difficulties finding the right word, mispronouncing words, rote-memory nightmares—all represent the expression of a single, isolated weakness. At the same time you will learn that other intellectual abilities—thinking, reasoning, understanding—are untouched by dyslexia. This contrasting pattern produces the paradox of dyslexia: profound and persistent difficulties experienced by some very bright people in learning to read. I am emphasizing the strengths of the dyslexic because there is often a tendency to underestimate his or her abilities. The reading problem is often glaringly apparent, while the strengths may be more subtle and overlooked. As I discuss later on, new insights into brain function in dyslexia tell us that it represents a very isolated weakness. The neural systems involved in thinking and reasoning are intact and perhaps even enhanced.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37" title="37"/><b>ALEX</b></h2>
			<p>
				In his first years of life, Alex was so quick to catch on to things that his parents were surprised when he struggled to learn his letters in kindergarten. When shown a letter he would stare, frown, and then randomly guess. He couldn’t seem to learn the letter names. In first grade he was struggling to link letters with their sounds. By the third grade Alex continued to stammer and sputter as he tried to decipher what was on the page in front of him. Language had clearly become a struggle for him. He seemed to understand a great deal, yet he was not always articulate. He mispronounced many words, leaving off the beginning (<i>lephant</i> for <i>elephant</i>) or the ends of words, or inverting the order within a word (<i>emeny</i> for <i>enemy</i>). Alex had trouble finding the exact word he wanted to say, even though it seemed he could tell you all about it. One evening he was trying to explain about sharks living in the ocean: “The water, the water, lots of water, salty water with big fish, it’s a lotion. No, no, that’s not what I mean. Oh, you know, it’s on all the maps, it’s a lotion—ocean, that’s what it is—a sea, no big sea, it’s an ocean, an ocean!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Looking at this handsome, very serious little boy who could spend hours putting together complex puzzles and assembling intricate model airplanes, his father could not believe that Alex had a problem. Alex, however, became increasingly aware of his difficulty reading, asking more and more frequently why all his friends were in a different reading group. He practiced, he tried, but it just never seemed to come out right.</p>
			<p class="indent">His parents brought him to the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity for evaluation. We learned that Alex was extremely smart, scoring in the gifted range in abstract reasoning and in logic. His vocabulary was also highly developed. Alex could learn, he could reason, and he could understand concepts at a very high level. Despite these strengths, his performance in reading words was dismal; for example, he was able to read only ten out of twenty-four words on a third-grade level. What gave Alex the most difficulty, however, was nonsense words (made-up words that can be pronounced; for example, <i>glim, rold</i>). He struggled to decipher these words. Sometimes he used the first letter to generate a response (such as <i>glim</i> for <i>gern, rold</i> for <i>ruck</i>); at other times it seemed as if he just gave up, making seemingly random guesses. In contrast, he was able to read a short passage silently and answer questions about it far better than he had been able to read and pronounce isolated single words. In reading silently he made good use of clues, such as pictures in the book and surrounding words that he could read, to help get <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38" title="38"/>to the meaning of sentences and passages that contained words he could not read. “I picture what it says,” he explained. However, Alex sparkled when asked to <i>listen</i> to a story and then respond to a series of questions, scoring significantly above average. Reading aloud was particularly painful for Alex: He was reluctant to read in front of the class, and it was easy to understand why. His reading was labored; words were mispronounced, substituted, or often omitted entirely. Words that he correctly read in one sentence would be misread in a subsequent sentence. He read excruciatingly slowly and haltingly. Increasingly Alex would ask to go to the bathroom when it was nearing his turn to read. If called upon, he often acted silly, making the words into a joke or tumbling himself onto the floor and laughing so that he would have to be sent out of the room.</p>
			<p class="indent">Poor spelling skills were compounded by his almost illegible handwriting. Letters were large, misshapen, and wobbly. In contrast, Alex’s math skills, particularly problem-solving and reasoning abilities, were in the superior range. At the close of the testing, Alex diagnosed his own reading problem: “I don’t know the sounds the letters make.” Furthermore, he told the evaluator that it bothered him that his friends were in a different reading group. Sometimes, he said, this made him very sad. His one wish was to be a better reader, but he didn’t know exactly how that would happen.</p>
			<p class="indent">When I met with Alex’s parents, they had many questions: Does he have a problem? If so, what is the nature of the problem? What could be done to help him? Above all, they asked, “Will he be all right?” I reassured them that not only would Alex survive, he would thrive.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>GREGORY</b></h2>
			<p>In the course of my work, I have evaluated for reading disabilities not only hundreds of children but also scores of young adult men and women. Their histories provide a picture of what the future will be for a bright child like Alex who happens to be dyslexic. Gregory, a medical student in his early twenties, was a grown-up Alex. He came to see me after experiencing a series of difficulties in his first-year medical courses. He was quite discouraged.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although he had been diagnosed as dyslexic in grade school, Gregory had also been placed in a program for gifted students. His native intelligence, together with extensive support and tutoring, had enabled him to graduate from high school with honors and to gain admission to an Ivy League college. In college Gregory had worked hard to compensate for his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39" title="39"/>disability and eventually received offers from several top medical schools. Now, however, he was beginning to doubt his own ability. He had no trouble comprehending the intricate relationships among physiological systems or the complex mechanisms of disease; indeed, he excelled in those areas that required reasoning skills. More difficult for him was pronouncing long words or novel terms (such as labels used in anatomic descriptions); perhaps his least well developed skill was that of rote memorization, for example, of dates and names of places.</p>
			<p class="indent">Both Gregory and his professors were perplexed by the inconsistencies in his performance. How could someone who understood difficult concepts so well have trouble with the smaller and simpler details? I explained that Gregory’s dyslexia (he was still a slow reader) could account for his inability to name tissue types and body parts in the face of his excellent reasoning skills. His history fit the clinical picture of dyslexia as it has been traditionally defined: an unexpected difficulty learning to read despite intelligence, motivation, and education. Furthermore, I was able to reassure him that scientists now understand the underlying nature of dyslexia that forms the basis for highly effective strategies to help those with the disorder.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>WHY ALEX AND GREGORY HAVE TROUBLE READING</b></h2>
			<p>
				Explanations of dyslexia put forth beginning in the 1920s and continuing until recently held that defects in the visual system were to blame for the reversals of letters and words thought to typify dyslexia. Eye training was often prescribed to overcome these alleged visual defects. Subsequent research has shown, however, that in contrast to a popular myth, children with dyslexia are not unusually prone to <i>seeing</i> letters or words backward, and that the deficit responsible for the disorder resides in phonology, a specific component of the language system. These poor readers, like Alex, do have significant difficulty, however, in <i>naming</i> the letters, often calling a <i>b</i> a <i>d</i> or reading <i>saw</i> as <i>was.</i> <span id="ftn-29"/>The problem is a linguistic one, not a visual one.</p>
			<p class="indent">As noted earlier, dyslexia represents a specific difficulty with reading, not with thinking skills. Comprehending spoken language is often at a very high level, as it was for Alex, as are other higher-level reasoning skills. Dyslexia is a localized problem.</p>
			<p class="indent">Understanding that dyslexia reflects a problem in a specific component of the language system and not a general weakness in intelligence or a primary visual impairment represented a major step forward. Further advances <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" title="40"/>have clarified the nature of the language impairment. Dyslexia does not reflect an overall defect in language but rather a localized weakness within a specific component of the language system: the phonologic module. The word <i>phonologic</i> is derived from the Greek word <i>phone,</i> meaning <i>sound</i> (as in <i>phonograph</i> and <i>telephone</i>). The phonologic module is the language factory, the functional part of the brain where the sounds of language are put together to form words and where words are broken down back into these elemental sounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">Over the past two decades a model of dyslexia has emerged that is based on phonological processing—processing the distinctive sounds of language. The phonological model is consistent both with how dyslexia manifests itself and with what neuroscientists know about brain organization and function. Over the past three decades, researchers at the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity and elsewhere have had the opportunity to test and refine this model through reading and, more recently, brain imaging studies. We and other dyslexia researchers have found that the phonological model provides a cogent explanation of why some very smart people have trouble learning to read.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE PHONOLOGICAL MODEL</b></h2>
			<p>
				To understand how the phonologic model works, you first have to understand how language is processed in the brain. <span id="ftn-30"/>Think of the language system as a graded series of modules or components, each devoted to a particular aspect of language. The operations within the system are rapid and automatic, and we are unaware of them. They are also mandatory. For example, if we are seated at a table in a dining room, we <i>must</i> hear what the person at the next table is saying if she is speaking loudly enough. It is nearly impossible to tune language out. That is why it is so difficult to study when others nearby are speaking.</p>
			<p class="indent">Scientists have been able to pinpoint the precise location of the glitch within the language system (Figure 4). At the upper levels of the language hierarchy are components involved with, for example, semantics (vocabulary or word meaning), syntax (grammatical structure), and discourse (connected sentences). At the lowest level of the hierarchy is the phonological module, which is dedicated to processing the distinctive sound elements of language. Dyslexia involves a weakness within the language system, specifically at the level of the phonologic module.</p>

				The phoneme<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c04-ftn-1" id="c04-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> is the fundamental element of the language system, the essential building block of all spoken and written words. Different combinations of just forty-four phonemes produce the tens of thousands of words in the English language. The word <i>cat,</i> for example, consists of three phonemes: <i>k, aah,</i> and <i>t.</i> Before words can be identified, understood, stored in memory, or retrieved from it, they must first be broken down into phonemes by the neural machinery of the brain. Just as proteins must first be broken down into their underlying amino acids before they can be digested, words must first be broken down into their underlying phonemes before they can be processed by the language system. Language is a code, and the only code that can be recognized by the language system and activate its machinery is the phonologic code.</p>
			<p class="indent">This is critical for both speaking and reading. Let’s first consider speaking (Figure 5). If I want to say the word <i>bat,</i> I will go into my internal dictionary or lexicon deep within my brain and first retrieve and then serially order the appropriate phonemes—<i>b, aah,</i> and <i>t</i>—and then I am ready to say the word <i>bat</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent">In children with dyslexia, the phonemes are less well developed. Think of such a phoneme as a child’s carved letter block whose face is so worn that the letter is no longer prominent. As a consequence, such children when speaking may have a hard time selecting the appropriate phoneme and may instead retrieve a phoneme that is similar in sound. Think of Alex’s experience <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42" title="42"/>in retrieving the word <i>lotion</i> when the word he was reaching for was <i>ocean.</i> Alex knew exactly what he wanted to say but could not retrieve the exact word, so instead he picked a close but incorrect phoneme. Alternately, a dyslexic might order the phonemes incorrectly, and the result might be, just as Alex said, <i>emeny</i> instead of <i>enemy.</i> Such sound-based confusions are quite common in the spoken language of dyslexics. For example, a child looking at his perspiring mother as she struggled in a traffic jam remarked, “You know, Mom, it’s not the heat, it’s the <i>humanity</i>.” (The intended word, of course, was <i>humidity.</i>) On another occasion a politician greeting his supporters said, “Welcome to this lovely <i>recession</i>.” Of course he meant to say <i>reception.</i> In each instance the confusion was a phonologic one (that is, based on the <i>sound</i> of the word) and did not reflect a lack of understanding of the meaning of the word in question. Unfortunately, such phonologic slips roll off the tongues of dyslexics fairly regularly and are often (incorrectly) attributed to a lack of understanding. In the next chapter I review what science has taught us about why some very smart people have trouble retrieving words as they speak.</p>

			<p>Reading is the converse of speaking. In reading we begin with the intact printed word on the page—the blocks representing phonemes are all lined up correctly. The reader’s job is to convert the letters to their sounds and to appreciate that the words are composed of smaller segments or phonemes (Figure 6).</p>
			<p class="indent">Dyslexic children and adults have difficulty in developing an awareness that spoken and written words are composed of these phonemes or building blocks. Think of the little boy who got his first pair of glasses and then said, “I never knew that building was made of red bricks. I always thought its wall was just one big smudge of red paint.” In the same way, while most of us can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43" title="43"/>detect the underlying sounds or phonemes in a word—for example <i>b, aah,</i> and <i>t</i> in <i>bat</i>—children who are dyslexic perceive a word as an amorphous blur, without an appreciation of its underlying segmental nature. They fail to appreciate the internal sound structure of words.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="indent">The phonologic model tells us the exact steps that must be taken if a child is to go from the puzzlement of seeing letters as abstract squiggly shapes to the satisfaction of recognizing and identifying these letter groups as words. Overall, the child must come to know that the letters he sees on the page represent, or map onto, the sounds he hears when the same word is spoken.</p>
			<p class="indent">The process of acquiring this knowledge is orderly and follows a logical sequence. First, a child becomes aware that words he hears are not just whole envelopes of sound. Just as the little boy noted the bricks in the wall, the beginning reader starts to notice that words are made up of smaller segments—that words have parts. Next the child becomes aware of the nature of these segments, that they represent sounds. He realizes, for example, that in the word <i>cat</i> there are three segments of sound, <i>k, aah,</i> and <i>t.</i> Then the child begins to link letters he sees on paper to what he hears in spoken language. He begins to realize that the letters are related to sounds he hears in words and that the printed word has the same number and the same sequence of phonemes (sounds) as the spoken word. Finally he comes to understand that the printed word and the spoken word are related. He knows that the printed word has an underlying structure and that it is the same <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44" title="44"/>structure he hears in the spoken word. He understands that both spoken and written words can be pulled apart based on the same sounds, but in print letters represent these sounds. Once the child has made this linkage, he has mastered what is referred to as <i>the alphabetic principle.</i> He is ready to read.</p>
			<p class="indent">Now I will consider the fundamental difficulty that is at the heart of dyslexia and why so many children have problems mastering the alphabetic principle. Later I will focus on how to teach these children most effectively to overcome their difficulties in reading.</p>
