			<p>One of the most rewarding experiences I can imagine is seeing a child who once was sad and defeated in school transformed into one who glows with an eagerness to learn. The new scientific breakthroughs in the teaching of reading are responsible for exactly that, in case after case. Talia Matthews is one of these happy children.</p>
			<p class="indent">When I first got to know Talia, she was a bright, bubbly, red-haired nine-year-old who radiated self-confidence. It had not always been that way. She was identified as dyslexic in third grade as part of one of our research projects. “Before, no one had said anything—not one word to even suggest that Talia had a reading problem,” her mother told me. “But the other children knew. They’d say, ‘Loser. You can’t read.’ ”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked Ms. Matthews if she had spoken to the school or if the school had spoken to her.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					Oh, yes. They told me, “We think it would be good if she buckled down and tried harder…. Maybe she just isn’t as smart as you think she is.” I can still hear them say, “Parents tend to think all kids are geniuses—when they are not.” And then after her testing I was told, “Your daughter is extremely smart. Her IQ is very high. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_198" title="198"/>Talia has a reading problem.” When I heard that, I cried. I said, “Oh, my God.” And they said they had a possible way they could work with her and teach her.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Talia was identified as dyslexic and placed in a reading program for one hour a day, four days a week for a year.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I noticed a real change in Talia. I saw her being interested in coming home and wanting to do her homework. It just came together. They taught her a new way.</p>
				<p class="indent">She did exactly what they were showing her. It was completely different from what they were teaching her in school. And if she didn’t know a word, she didn’t want any help from anyone. And that was a big difference. Before, she would beg someone else, “Please just do it for me.”</p>
				<p class="indent">It’s unbelievable how this has affected our family. Before, we felt so much guilt for how we had been treating her. I would say, “What’s wrong with you? Your brother has his homework done. And we can’t even get you to do two answers.” We were grilling her, you know, like in her face. So my husband and I had a lot of guilt about how we were treating her until she was diagnosed with dyslexia and went into the reading program.</p>
				<p class="indent">Life is better in our family; it’s normal. And [Talia] has friends and she feels better about herself. She has girls call her, and she says, “Mom, they think I’m really cool.”</p>
				<p class="indent">She tells everyone, “I couldn’t read. And I was tested. And there was actually a problem with me, and they taught me how to fix it.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">I asked Ms. Matthews what she wanted to tell other parents whose children might have dyslexia.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>There is a way to teach your child. You just have to find the right method. Reading can be the most important thing in the world because it affects everything—everything. I would say don’t give up. Try to find someone who can evaluate your child and see what way she needs to be taught.</p>
				<p class="indent">Now Talia can do anything. She already has a vision of what she wants to do with her life. She wants to be a veterinarian.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199" title="199"/>Your dyslexic child can become a reader just like Talia did. Rather than a magic wand, such a transformation requires early screening, which leads to early diagnosis <i>and</i> effective treatment. I’ve already told you how to identify a reading problem early; now I want to focus on what to do once a child is identified. I will provide you with the basic principles to guide you and allow you to determine what is best for your child. They are the same principles that are helpful in identifying dyslexia; now you can apply these to obtain the most effective treatment.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE YOU</b></h2>
			<p>An effective program is tailored to a child’s specific developmental needs. As you now know, what works best for a six-year-old is not going to be the most helpful approach for a sixteen-year-old. Accordingly, the first step in designing an effective reading program is to determine where your child is on the developmental continuum. Within such a framework, there has been a major change in emphasis. To repeat:</p>

			</div>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> <span id="ftn-115"/>Strong scientific data show that Response to Intervention (RTI) is not an effective approach. As I will discuss in detail later, a large federal study released in 2015 indicated that <i>first-grade children who received intervention using an RTI approach actually read less well than their peers who did not receive RTI.</i></p>

				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>As the child progresses in school and reaches middle school and then high school—particularly those who have the potential to participate in demanding academic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200" title="200"/>programs—the focus expands to ensuring that necessary accommodations are provided.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">To soften the impact of the phonologic weakness, focus on fluency and vocabulary and access the child’s higher-level thinking and reasoning strengths (through accommodations). This is important because it places emphasis not only on the child’s reading difficulty but on his strengths. It reminds everyone that the isolated phonologic weakness is only one small part of a much larger picture. Far too often the focus is only on the weakness, and the child’s strong capabilities (and potential) are overlooked. Whatever those strengths are—the ability to reason, to analyze, to conceptualize, to be creative, to have empathy, to visualize, to imagine, or to think in novel ways—it is imperative that these strengths be identified, nurtured, and allowed to define that child. Accommodations represent the difference between academic success and failure, between having a test result reflect ability rather than slow reading because of dyslexia, between a growing sense of self-confidence and an enduring sense of defeat.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are some other important factors that can significantly influence your child’s eventual success in reading and in life. They can be seen in Figure 41.</p>
			<p class="indent">Considering solely the <i>child’s qualities,</i> his long-term outlook will mainly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_201" title="201"/>reflect the severity of his phonologic weakness and the degree of his cognitive strengths. Not surprisingly, children with milder phonologic difficulties and higher intellectual capacities tend to do better. <span id="ftn-116"/>There is now evidence that children all along the continuum of dyslexia can benefit from <i>evidence-based</i> reading programs. In addition, the presence, severity, and effectiveness of approaches to associated conditions such as anxiety and ADHD will affect his future.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">The significant adults in a dyslexic child’s life—typically her parents and teachers—play an enormous role in determining her future outlook. While this would seem to be self-evident, I have witnessed far too many instances where the most loving and well-intentioned parents or teachers have taken an uncharacteristically passive stance and assumed that somehow “things will work out.” It is not easy to be the parent of a vulnerable child, and particularly a child with a hidden disability that can escape diagnosis, as Talia’s mother so poignantly demonstrated. But the reality is that in the overwhelming number of cases, the only way things will improve is if a knowledgeable and caring adult, a patient, persevering, and positive parent, takes the lead and <i>actively</i> creates change.</p>
			<p class="indent">A child with dyslexia is in need of a champion, someone who will be his support and his unflinching advocate, his cheerleader when things are not going well, his friend and confidante when others tease and shame him, his supporter who by actions and comments expresses optimism for his future. Perhaps most important, the struggling reader needs someone who will not only believe in him and take positive action but who understands the nature of his reading problem and then relentlessly works to ensure that he receives the reading help and other support he needs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Experience has shown me that if a child receives such help, she will succeed. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202" title="202"/>David and Phyllis Lapin of Los Angeles, who have worked incredibly hard and been persistent in trying to understand dyslexia and to use that knowledge to support their very bright dyslexic daughter, Emma, can serve as models. Their strong belief in their daughter and desire to ensure she reaches her potential and feels good about herself have influenced virtually everything they do as parents.</p>

				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>They encouraged her to be able to express what it feels like to have difficulty with reading.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>They investigated and found an effective reading program for her.</p>

Although not “horse people,” her family embraced Emma’s desire to have a horse when, following a visit to a dude ranch, they saw how much confidence her riding skill gave her and how it helped her maintain her sense of self.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Emma met with a tutor regularly; she was designated as the tutor’s “senior research assistant” and her father the “junior research assistant” who was to attend all the lessons. As a result, David was able to practice with his child on the days she was not scheduled to see her tutor, so rather than receiving one lesson per week, she received three.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Early on, when their daughter had a great deal of difficulty reading, her parents read most books before she did, often taking notes.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Emma attended a rigorous independent school for girls. As a senior there, she gained early admission to Washington University, from which she graduated with honors and a 3.85 GPA. She is now a proud alum entering Washington University School of Law and looking forward to a career as an attorney.</p>
			<p class="indent">A child who has such champions will not only succeed academically but will maintain her sense of self and the possibilities for a happy future. This book is meant to give parents who want to be champions for their children the confidence and know-how that will allow them to make a real difference in their child’s life—because they can. Not only parents but other adults as well can be champions who make a significant difference in a struggling dyslexic child’s life.</p>

			<p>Our knowledge of what works in teaching reading has come to us through science. My goal is to align teaching reading with twenty-first-century science. This new knowledge can be put to use to provide a sensible and successful approach to teaching children to read—children without reading difficulties, children who are at-risk for reading problems, and especially children who are known to be dyslexic. Constantly bombarded by information about different approaches to teaching reading and about new “miracle” treatments for dyslexia, some parents (and teachers, too) are confused about reading instruction. How do you know how to determine what is the best reading program for your son or daughter? The good news is that data coming in from laboratories all over the world are providing an increasingly deeper understanding of the process of learning to read. At long last, scientific evidence is replacing anecdotes, myths, and ingrained belief systems lacking in evidence.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-117"/>For the first time ever, there is now an evidence-based guide to what elements are necessary in teaching children to read. By <i>evidence-based,</i> I mean that in a <i>clinical trial</i> comparing two different methods of teaching reading, one method has actually <i>proven</i> to be superior. This means that there is actual evidence of the effectiveness of this method. Evidence-based interventions differ substantially from <i>research-based</i> interventions, those that in theory should work.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Evidence-based means that the intervention has proven to be effective in a rigorous clinical trial,</i> the gold standard for which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which the potential intervention is tested head to head with another intervention. In medicinal trials we test against a placebo; in education trials we test against what the school has typically used.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Randomized</i> means that the children participating are randomly assigned to the treatments. This ensures that the researchers prevent potential bias that could occur if more good (or more struggling) readers were intentionally assigned to one group rather than another.</p>
			<p class="indent">In medical trials, <i>double-blind</i> refers to the fact that neither the doctors testing a medication or treatment nor the patients receiving the medication know whether the patients are receiving the medication or a placebo. In trials of potential reading interventions, it is very difficult to keep everyone—the teachers, the school administrators, the children, the parents—in the dark about which intervention they are receiving, so the investigator modifies <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204" title="204"/>the experimental design, which is referred to as <i>quasi-experimental.</i> The key point is that the intervention is compared to another one in the same exact time frame.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>THE REPORT OF THE NATIONAL READING PANEL</b></h2>
			<p>
				The National Reading Panel emerged as an outgrowth of a grassroots concern that while a substantial number of children were failing to learn to read, little was available to help parents and teachers make important choices among different approaches to reading instruction. So in 1997, as I mentioned earlier, Congress directed the creation of the National Reading Panel of experts to objectively and comprehensively review the existing research relating to the teaching of reading. As a member of the panel, I can attest to how seriously the group took its mission, traveling across the country listening to parents, teachers, and others; developing rigorous criteria to review the existing research; and identifying thousands of studies and then subjecting them to careful analysis. On April 13, 2000, after more than two years of effort, the panel released its findings in the <i>Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction.</i> It was with great pride that I along with the panel chair, Dr. Donald Langenberg, and then director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Dr. Duane Alexander, presented the report to Congress. The report, the most thorough ever to be undertaken in American education, provides a road map to guide parents and teachers to the most effective, scientifically proven components for teaching reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">The findings of the panel signal a critical first step in a revolution in how children are taught to read, ensuring that every child is provided with a reading program that works. It is an important step in our goal of aligning education with science. The National Reading Panel made a major contribution by employing a rigorous scientific process to identify these essential components in any effective program to teach reading:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_205" title="205"/>Now we need to determine through rigorous studies what the optimal combination and timing of these elements is.</p>
			<p class="indent">The establishment of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the Department of Education reflects an important positive development. Within medicine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) serves to protect the consumer by ensuring that medications and medical devices must have evidence of safety and efficacy before they are approved for sale. There is no equivalent organization in trials of potential reading interventions. Though the WWC has no enforcement power, it rates evidence behind various programs and textbooks, using criteria similar to the ones researchers use to assess the effectiveness of medical treatments. This represents a significant potential aid to educators and parents in selecting effective programs. Though the WWC is a major step forward, it remains a work in progress.</p>
			<p class="indent">Caution is indicated. In a <i>New York Times</i> story about the WWC, Gina Kolata wrote in 2013 that there has been a paucity of <span id="ftn-118"/>“solid answers [about what works in education], just guesses and hunches, marketing hype and extrapolations from small pilot studies.” She further pointed out that the selection of materials such as reading programs “can affect achievement as profoundly as teachers themselves; a poor choice of materials is at least as bad as a terrible teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">All who care about reading and dyslexia should be aware of the caveats noted in this piece. According to Kolata, this new-to-education scientific approach and the evidence-based data it brings with it are unknown to most educators, including principals, superintendents, and curriculum supervisors. Says Kolata, educators don’t know that the data exist, “much less what they mean.” Often claims of effectiveness made by program developers, when carefully examined, have “no evidence behind them. And when rigorous studies were done, as many as 90 percent of programs that seemed promising in small, unscientific studies had no effect on achievement or actually made achievement scores worse.”</p>
			<p class="indent">In programs intending to teach teachers how to improve their students’ reading achievement, data may indicate that the teachers’ knowledge of the subject has improved but <i>without</i> a comparable improvement in their students’ achievement. <span id="ftn-119"/>During the time I served on the board of directors at the Institute for Education Sciences, I listened to a review of a highly touted professional development program for teaching reading and heard how teachers improved but their students did not. This taught me a lesson about the strong need for large trials before accepting that a program can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206" title="206"/>help the students it is meant to help. According to Jon Baron, vice president of evidence-based policy at Arnold Ventures, “Most programs claim to be evidence-based but have no good evidence that they work.” As Robert Slavin, director of the Center for Research and Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University, says, educators “too often…are swayed by marketing or anecdotes or the latest fad. And invariably, folks trying to sell a program will say there is evidence behind it,” when the evidence is not rigorous at all, or in fact is lacking.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the discussion that follows of what approaches to teaching reading are most effective at different points along the reading continuum, you may notice that, based on the newest data available, I have removed some of the programs mentioned in the first edition. I also question some of the recommendations of the WWC, reflecting inadequacies in the studies relied on or subjective decisions by WWC evaluators to include programs where sufficient evidence does not appear to exist. I indicate where this is the case.</p>
			<p class="indent">Breaking the reading code is the most critical, and for many children the most difficult, step, and I will devote great attention to that. Then I will focus on how to ensure that a child becomes a skilled reader—that is, a reader who reads accurately and rapidly and understands what he reads. I will also discuss what to do for the child who continues to experience difficulties.</p>
