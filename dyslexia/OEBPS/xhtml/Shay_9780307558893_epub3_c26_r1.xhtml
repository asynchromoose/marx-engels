				Each of these people experienced early difficulties involving reading. So the question is, how do you get from <i>here</i>—a dyslexic student entering high school—to <i>there</i>?</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>IT BEGINS WITH A PLAN</b></h2>
			<p>Just as when you want to build a house, you have to start with a plan and then go on to build a strong foundation, in making a successful journey from high school to college and a career, each dyslexic student has to make a plan that best suits his or her specific needs, skills, and hopes for the future. Planning for college begins years before the application process kicks in. It should start in ninth grade, and no later than tenth grade. Consider the planning process from the perspective of three broad areas:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_361" title="361"/><i>Academics,</i> including developing resiliency and the level of confidence and knowledge of dyslexia to comfortably and effectively self-advocate</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Organizational skills,</i> including actions and activities to undertake to sharpen a child’s skills and attitude</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Personal focus,</i> especially on the inner self and possible conditions that might impact, and indeed impinge on, optimal learning.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 class="head"><b>ACADEMICS</b></h3>
			<p>Recommended academic-related considerations and goals:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Increasing independence.</i> Once your dyslexic child is in high school, gradually encourage him to assume more responsibility for <i>increasing independence in decision making,</i> the sort he will require in college. His increased autonomy will reflect a growing base of solid knowledge of his dyslexia.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">This is an ongoing process and not an arbitrary, sharp line of demarcation announcing immediate or sudden change. Rather, the goal is gradually, over time, to impart the knowledge of dyslexia along with the confidence in your child in order for her to be empowered to understand dyslexia and its impact on her, her strengths as well as the areas of difficulty. Together, along with thinking about her dyslexia, she should think about her interests, her areas of enjoyment, her ideal future career, and the implications of each.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Developing self-confidence leading to self-advocacy.</i> As a dyslexic student gets to know who he is, feels comfortable in his own skin, knows that while he may not be a fast reader or a super speller, he is bright and has much to offer the world, he grows in his self-confidence, his independence, and in his ability to self-advocate.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">The goal is for these elements to come together while the student is still in high school, if not before. I have met many dyslexic students who have shared with me powerful, and often painful, stories of their experiences of being <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_362" title="362"/>misunderstood and criticized by well-meaning but ignorant teachers. All of these students light up when they recount the moment when they felt not only comfortable but impelled to stand up and advocate for themselves.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Having endured much during their school years, dyslexics develop <i>resilience</i> that many of their classmates who sail through school often lack. It can emerge in many forms, as Izer’s mom describes:</p>
				<p class="list0_nonindent spaceabove">Izer has an incredible belief in himself, which he has earned. At Gow, the specialized boarding school for dyslexic students that Izer attended, he would be up until three or four in the morning his whole senior year, working very hard. He does that, puts the time into it. When others in his frat are partying, he buckles down and does what he needs to do. Reflecting what he learned before coming to college, Izer realizes he has to work harder than the other kids to get through…. His experience working incredibly hard and succeeding established a work ethic that served him extremely well throughout college at the University of Pennsylvania and will continue to serve him as he now pursues graduate study and throughout life.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent spaceabove">The positive role of resilience in a dyslexic person’s life was crystallized for me by Adam, a young neurosurgery resident. Bennett and I were just closing the last slide of a PowerPoint lecture on dyslexia one sunny afternoon in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, when one of the attendees shyly came up to the podium. He wanted us to know that he was dyslexic and that without question he was confident in succeeding. As Adam explained, a neurosurgical residency, which requires eight very intense years, has perhaps the highest dropout rate in all of medicine. Adam shook his head and uttered with calm assurance, “Not me. I know I will be there to receive my certificate as a graduate of the neurosurgical residency program. Why? As a dyslexic, I have met and had to conquer and climb over so many obstacles put in my way, I have developed what I can only describe as resolute resilience, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_363" title="363"/>and honestly, nothing stands in my way now. If I take on something, I will succeed. It’s a good feeling.”</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Sharpening academic skills.</i> Review your child’s reading fluency, vocabulary, ability to write essays and reports, math skills—anything he will need when you are not there to coach him and review assignments with him. Ask yourself, what skills does he still need to improve so that he is able to function more independently in college? Depending on the college, there will probably be some support, but not nearly as much as most dyslexic students receive when they are living at home during their high school years. Speak to his teachers, analyze his report cards, review any testing carried out by the school or privately. Ask yourself, would he benefit from more support, for example, in math or writing? Ask your son’s teachers if they think there are things your son or you can do to help solidify his academic skills.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Learning about assistive technology.</i> Would he benefit from any text-to-speech, speech-to-text note-taking? Are there software and apps that might help? Technology requires time to harness; a learning curve is associated with using different apps, and glitches will occur. So it is best to begin practice or tryout periods with any technology the summer before the senior year of high school, so together you and your child can determine if it is really helpful and if the time required outweighs potential benefits.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Receiving appropriate accommodations.</i> Given that your child is dyslexic, there is an extremely high probability that he is a slow reader despite having good, and often very high, intelligence. Is he receiving all the necessary <i>accommodations</i> that will level the playing field—extra time on tests, exams given in separate, quiet rooms, use of a laptop in class and on tests? See <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c32_r1.xhtml#page_438">this page</a> for a discussion of specific accommodations and their roles in supporting a dyslexic student.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">In order for your child to request the most appropriate and effective accommodations in colleges and universities, she must be aware of her diagnosis of dyslexia, understand <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_364" title="364"/>how it impacts her, and know that dyslexia is persistent. It does not go away over time. Your child will go away to college; her dyslexia will go with her. A common complaint from many college resource offices is that students come to see them later than they should. The student’s explanation (or hope): “I thought I no longer had dyslexia.” They arrive on campus magically thinking they no longer require support, or saying that they want a fresh start and will not use accommodations. Most people don’t realize how much students who are dyslexic wish they did not need to use accommodations. The persistence of dyslexia in virtually everyone who has the condition, including bright college students, means that it is essential that they know what support and accommodations they will require in college, knowledge best acquired prior to college entry.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Focusing on high school course selection.</i> Your child needs to develop an awareness of what the prerequisites are for areas of academic specialization. Is she prepared? Is she going to, and is she ready to follow a high school path focused on AP courses such as English language; English literature; U.S. history; biology, chemistry, or physics; or calculus AB or calculus BC? It is never too early in high school for your child to speak to her advisor and to make contact with a college advisor (if your school has such an individual) to discuss plans and prerequisites and her readiness (and desire) to pursue these pathways. If your child chooses to take AP courses followed by the AP exam, she must apply for accommodations in a timely manner. The college advisor should be helpful in this regard.</p>
			</div>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> Be aware that school personnel often underestimate a dyslexic student’s ability to pursue advanced work in certain areas, misjudging the student’s high intellect.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Higher-Level Mathematics.</i> If your child expresses an interest in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) but seems to have had trouble with early arithmetic or learning, consider highly regarded economist Diane <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_365" title="365"/>Swonk’s experience in math. Early on in school, Swonk, who is dyslexic, couldn’t memorize the multiplication tables or add a column of figures, but later on, calculus and algebra were, as she describes it, “a piece of cake.” For Swonk and many other dyslexics, difficulties in performing early calculations or memorizing the times table are poor indicators of later ability to carry out complex mathematical analyses. Parents should not allow schools to prevent their dyslexic child from pursuing higher-level academic classes in a range of disciplines because of misunderstandings of aspects of dyslexia. For example, some educators have mistaken the term <i>slow,</i> as in slow reading (lack of fluency), to indicate overall slowness in mentation, which is typically not the case. One dyslexic student I know of was not allowed to take advanced algebra because she required extra time. The child changed schools and went on to excel in advanced math classes.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Creative Writing.</i> At times a teacher may confuse a dyslexic child’s poor spelling with an inability to write sophisticated essays or highly imaginative stories. John Irving was a C– student in English who struggled to produce a final draft that reflected his imagination and writing, rather than his poor spelling. Too often teachers, and parents, as well, see what is easy to see, pouncing on spelling errors that seem to leap off the page, and allow that to deter any focus on or consideration of the deeper, less visible, complex creative elements making up the child’s essay. Don’t allow this to happen to your child. Children should be judged separately for spelling and grammar and for creativity and imagination. Such an approach encourages the teacher to appreciate the rich creative thought that often lies just beneath the typos and spelling errors.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Medicine.</i> As a middle-school student, Dr. Tyler Lucas met with his eighth-grade advisor, who asked what Tyler was interested in as a career. The response was quick and clear: “I want to be a doctor.” The teacher shook his head, looked Lucas straight in the eye, and declared, “No, Tyler, medicine is not for people like you, people who are dyslexic.” Dr. Lucas knew better than to accept the biased view of his teacher. Although I’m not sure what his advisor is doing today, I do know that Tyler is now a well-respected and highly successful orthopedic surgeon practicing in New York City.</p>
			<p class="indent">In thinking about your child’s future, keep in mind the whole child. Try <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_366" title="366"/>to see beyond the glaring misspellings, bad penmanship, and awkward typos and look at her ability to reason, connect the dots, ask out-of-the-box questions, and create highly imaginative stories, characters, and games. If you or her teachers limit your vision to the superficial, you will restrict her opportunities and relegate your child to a lesser life than she deserves. In reviewing many dyslexic Yale students’ personal histories, I am struck again and again by how a given successful student struggled and was often underestimated but, most typically with the strong support of her parents or a teacher who became her unwavering champions, went on to accomplish what years earlier would have been deemed the impossible. Don’t underestimate your child’s ability. Don’t relegate her to second-class status when she, with your ongoing support, could excel at high academic levels.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Foreign-Language Courses.</i> Dyslexia genuinely and powerfully interferes with a student’s ability to master foreign languages. As I’ve noted, having to learn a foreign language involves a dyslexic’s weakest area: getting to the sounds of spoken language. Much depends on the nature of the foreign language offered by the school. For example, Spanish, having a much more predictable linking of sounds to letters, may be more palatable to dyslexic students than French, in which, as in English, a letter can have multiple pronunciations. Some students find learning Latin prefixes and suffixes (which are also used in English) helpful in enriching their English vocabulary. Important, too, is <i>how the language is taught</i> and <i>what the expectations are.</i> For example, is English spoken in the class, with the focus mainly on learning vocabulary and watching films in the second language, or does the course accelerate rapidly to the point that the class is conducted almost entirely in the new language?</p>
			<p class="indent">To try to accommodate a dyslexic student’s predictable difficulties in foreign-language learning, you might ask if the course can be taken pass/fail. If this is not the case, I would strongly recommend requesting a partial waiver of the foreign-language requirement in favor of taking a course in the culture or history of a country that does not speak English. While this accommodation is becoming more common in colleges, high schools, for the most part, are still lagging behind. Hopefully this will change in the near future.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> Be aware that students enrolled in an International Baccalaureate program in high school must take a foreign language <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_367" title="367"/>(excluding Latin) and typically are not permitted language waivers.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">In my experience, the initial offerings of a foreign language in high school are often approachable and not very demanding, even for dyslexic students, but again, this very much depends on the school. Many students have found it best to take the language course during the summer, when it is the only course they have to focus on, but only after first making sure that the school will accept this for credit.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>ASL.</i> An alternative that some students have pursued is to take American Sign Language (ASL), if offered by their school or elsewhere during the summer, when the time required is not an issue. CJ, a ninth-grader with dyslexia, was required to take a foreign language. Thinking that not taking a foreign language in high school would limit his college options, he searched for an alternative. He found an ASL summer course offered at a local community college and decided to enroll. Each class was held for three hours, three times a week, for six weeks. Only ASL was used in class.</p>
			<p class="indent">CJ found learning ASL fairly easy. In each class he was given forty-five to fifty vocabulary words to learn. His teacher would sign in front of the class and he would write down the word or phrase that was signed. The next time the class met, these words were reviewed and then a new set of forty-five to fifty words was introduced. This pattern of instruction was fairly consistent, and CJ learned over eight hundred words during the summer. He found learning sign language easier than learning English vocabulary because ASL is so visual: hand gestures depict words and their meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">While CJ completed the course with an A, he is not able to sign fluidly. He is capable of expressing his ideas if he signs slowly, but he struggles to keep pace with anyone who knows sign language well. He believes that his ability to sign can be equal to that of his classmates and he plans to take ASL again next summer, and the one after that, in the hope of receiving a foreign-language credit.</p>
			<p class="indent">CJ’s experience with ASL stands as a positive recommendation for those students who are considering a foreign-language option. Some students who enroll in ASL courses actually find they enjoy it and soon find themselves thinking about minoring in ASL, along with a future career that would take advantage of their knowledge.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_368" title="368"/>To sum up, when considering academic planning, none of us has a crystal ball to guess our child’s or student’s future. In thinking about a child’s potential, what we can and should do, however, is not give credence to misleading and superficial clues and ignore more powerful but often less visible clues. Here, I am referring to a child’s ability to think, to reason, to generate great ideas. As children, economist Diane Swonk and financier Charles Schwab were not linear but more abstract thinkers—a rare and enviable ability, which may be lost on many, including parents and teachers. Don’t underestimate your child or his or her future possibilities. Aim high, have confidence in your son or daughter, convey that belief, and make sure that any academic paths are not prematurely closed off in high school.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beware of well-meaning schools and faculty who may prematurely lower expectations and route children to a less challenging and ultimately less rewarding pathway. <span id="ftn-157"/>Instead, share with your child the stories of the many successful adults who also struggled early on in school and who, through belief in themselves, hard work, and persistence, were able to gain confidence in themselves and go on to realize their dream. View the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity’s public service announcement (PSA) and smile as you learn how a very special sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Bennewitz, was able to recognize her student Patrick’s dyslexia as well as his high ability and gave him that confidence. As a result, Patrick graduated from Georgia Tech, formed his own successful company, and now holds more than twenty-five patents. (Link to the PSA at <a href="http://dyslexia.yale.edu/dyslexia/dyslexia-psa/">dyslexia.yale.edu/dyslexia/dyslexia-psa/</a>.)</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>ORGANIZATION</b></h3>
			<p>The transition from high school to college can be a shock to the system if a student is not prepared for the new responsibilities, not only in academics but those that are part of living on his own without parental support and reminders. Because the student is the active participant in this, I’m going to address her directly.</p>
			<p class="indent">You might consider this your <i>Personal College Prep 101.</i> All students experience a kind of disequilibrium when they first enter college, and dyslexic students often more so, because for the first time they are truly on their own, without the physical presence of parents and obvious school support. Happily, much of this can be prevented and certainly lessened by preparation that goes on during high school. You might even think of high school as a prep school in this regard.</p>
			<p class="indent">How you manage your time and work as a college student, how you make <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_369" title="369"/>sure to organize and prepare for both the academic work and the activities of daily living, is vitally important. If it seems I am veering from the subject of dyslexia, it’s only because time management is a part of overcoming it. To begin at the beginning, let’s take a look at getting up in the morning. Now is the time to practice getting up on your own on school mornings, if you don’t do so already. Alarms are easy to access on your smartphone, and many students find this works well for them. The important thing is to figure out what works for you.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">

Develop a model that you are comfortable with and will use.</p>

Having a constant look-forward-to time to get away from the anxieties and worries and be free to let loose and do something for yourself should be part of a daily routine. Getting into the habit of taking time to go out of your room and exercise will be welcome, indeed essential, once you are in college and you find yourself sitting in a room or library with hours of work to do. It will allow you to relax, feel better, and work more efficiently. Start doing this in high school.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Try to master large, long-term projects.</i> The reports and projects you do in high school will become even more complex and expansive in college. High school offers a terrific opportunity to learn and become more adept at the organizational skills needed to approach and master such projects.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">A major principle here is to think about the goal of the project and the components needed to complete it. Think of taking one bite at a time. I refer to the process as <i>thinking</i> and <i>doing</i>. A useful approach is first to conceptualize the project and divide it into meaningful components, listing each section or topic. For the <i>doing</i> part, make a time line and mark on your calendar proposed dates for completing each section. For each step you want to list <i>what</i> needs to be done, <i>when</i> it will be done, and <i>how</i> it will be completed. <i>As the project moves along, any external support should begin to be phased out.</i> Note-taking programs (described on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c31_r1.xhtml#page_432">this page</a>) can make a major difference. OneNote or Notability allows you to easily group notes relating to specific topics. As each stage of the project is completed, treat yourself to some reward, like a favorite snack or time to play a computer game or briefly shoot hoops or do yoga.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Use flash cards.</i> Here’s a suggestion that Allison, a brilliant dyslexic young woman, shared with me: She uses <i>flash cards to help plan and organize</i> her work. You can use Post-its or index cards for the same purpose. One approach is to divide the topic into major areas and have a flash card for each and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_371" title="371"/>then arrange below each major card a series of cards, each containing a different subcomponent of that specific area. Once you’re in college there are going to be lots of reports to do, and if you have already mastered the approach, you’ll have a template to work with no matter what the topic is. Many dyslexic students also find making the flash cards and then reviewing them over and over again very helpful in making material stick.

			<h3 class="head"><b>PERSONAL</b></h3>
			<p>Switching back to parental concerns, high school is an ideal time to clarify and resolve any remaining issues concerning your child’s acceptance and understanding of her dyslexia, and that it is a lifelong condition.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Understanding the benefits of an early diagnosis.</i> Be reassured that your child brings with him to college the major advantage of early identification. He knows who he is and has adapted to his dyslexia. This typically means he has had support not only to learn but also to try out and optimize helpful learning strategies. While he is still in high school, he has the opportunity to work on activities that will build his confidence and chances of success in college. Earlier-identified students enter college having learned that they are not dumb. Most important, they have the benefit of having growing confidence in their abilities, a confidence that makes a world of difference once they enter college. They embrace the mantra <i>This is the way the world is, and this is the way I have to operate</i>—and they do!</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Fully understanding dyslexia.</i> Talking about dyslexia should be an ongoing conversation over time. Make sure your child understands what dyslexia is, that it is an unexpected difficulty, that dyslexia is a paradox with both weaknesses and strengths, and that it is a lifelong condition. Reviewing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_372" title="372"/>the yellow card (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c08_r1.xhtml#page_98">this page</a>) detailing the contrasting symptoms of dyslexia when your child is still in high school is often a great conversation starter. You also want to make sure she has her copy of this card.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Many have found it helpful to role-play, with the child and parent taking turns asking each other about how dyslexia has affected them. This helps to solidify the student’s understanding of herself, providing very helpful practice in answering a question she will be asked on many occasions when she is in college—by the disability office staff or a professor—and even afterward, perhaps when applying for a job. At these times, she will be glad to have a high level of understanding of her dyslexia.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Clarifying any other diagnoses or concerns.</i> It would be wise to make an appointment for your child to have a complete physical examination, including vision and hearing tests, during her junior year in high school. In this way, if a problem is detected, it can be addressed and treated prior to her going to college. The fewer the distractions, the better.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Clarifying psychological issues.</i> There are several conditions that co-occur frequently with dyslexia, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorder. This is the time to be sure of the presence or absence of these conditions, and if present, to ensure optimal intervention, including</p>
				<ul class="ul">
					<li><i>reviewing medication your child is taking</i> for ADHD or anxiety to make sure it is necessary and that she is on an optimal dosage. This is a time when medication adjustments can be made, their effects observed, and any needed changes implemented before college. Of course, any changes should be discussed with the prescribing physician.</li>
					<li><i>considering nonpharmacological therapies.</i> If your son is anxious, you may want to consider whether other treatments may be helpful, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is aimed at changing a person’s current way of nonproductive thinking and behavior, a change that often is transformative, producing positive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_373" title="373"/>improvement in his outlook and mood. <span id="ftn-158"/>If your child appears stressed, another approach is “mindfulness”—basically a state of awareness, of paying attention to what is happening at the moment without being judgmental. (See <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c30_r1.xhtml#page_424">this page</a> for a more in-depth discussion of anxiety and mindfulness.)</li>

			<p class="indent">As you get ready to leave for college, you may want to keep in mind the thoughts of a wonderful, brilliant young woman, Hallel, as she prepared to leave for her freshman semester:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Next week I will be going to college and the person that is going could only be at the place she is with your help and diagnosis. [Hallel was recently diagnosed at our center.] Thank you so much again. You and your husband helped me change my story. Thank you doesn’t really begin to describe how thankful I am that you came into my life. With your diagnosis, I was able to stop telling and believing a story that I felt was true at its very core. I was able to believe that another story could be told. You have changed my life and allowed me to see a different future—a future I am so excited to discover. Thank you for helping me to see myself. Now at the edge of the next adventure it’s really nice to be reminded of the steps, challenges, and triumphs it has taken to get here.</p>
