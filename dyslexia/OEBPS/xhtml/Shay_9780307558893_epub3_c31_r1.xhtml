			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY</b></h1>
			<p>
				Critical for the dyslexic child using technology is his or her facility in inputting and accessing digitized text.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c31-ftn-1" id="c31-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> <i>Teach your child to touch type as early as possible. First grade works for many children.</i> This means that the child must be adept at keyboarding. Arizona State University professors Steven Graham and Karen Harris, in the context of teaching writing, emphasize the importance of the student learning to use word processing: <span id="ftn-181"/>“Many schools still use 19th-century writing tools such as pencil and paper, even though scientific studies demonstrate that students in grades 1 to 12 show greater improvement in their writing over time when they use word processing to write at school versus writing by hand…. We obviously need to move writing instruction more squarely into the 21st century, making it possible for our students to take advantage of word processing and other electronic methods for composing.” A number of good programs are available to teach keyboarding to children, including <i>Typing Instructor for Kids,</i> available from Amazon for both PC and Mac systems. It uses games to motivate children as they learn to type. Once the dyslexic child has mastered keyboarding, he will</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_431" title="431"/>have at his disposal a number of programs for note-taking, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the same vein, since text-to-speech is perhaps the most ubiquitous of the technologies offered to all students, especially dyslexic students, it is important to recognize the logical and sequential steps necessary for its use. These are:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Obtain digitized text or have text of interest digitized</p>

				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>Apply text-to-speech app to read digitized text of interest</p>
			</div>
			<p>Knowing these steps should help students to understand the various technological fixes or apps described in the subsequent sections.</p>
			<p class="indent">While there are many advantages for the dyslexic child in using technology, there are potential downsides as well. This is especially important to remember when the child is using text-to-speech software. <span id="ftn-182"/>In studies of eighth- and ninth-graders, poor readers presented with text bimodally (onscreen, highlighted, while being voiced) improved in comprehension compared to students who were presented with the text visually. <span id="ftn-183"/>But a negative effect of text-to-speech software on reading was demonstrated in fourth- and fifth-graders, presumably as the consequence of passively listening to the auditory presentation rather than actively reading the text. These data support what I always tell my patients and their families: Text-to-speech software is often very helpful to older children and young adults in high school, college, and graduate school but must be used cautiously and sparingly in younger children, who must be encouraged to read as much as possible. As I have already said, the way children improve in their reading fluency is to read connected text as much as possible. Text-to-speech technology can limit the practice in reading that dyslexic children need so critically.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>You and your child must grasp that, no matter what the technology, there is a learning curve associated with its use.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">A speech-to-text tool such as Dragon, for example, requires a fair amount of practice and patience before it can be of help. Note-taking software and text-to-speech software—the most commonly used technologies—are usually much easier to learn. It is crucial that the dyslexic child not be discouraged. That’s why I think it is so important for him to begin to take ownership of the use of the technology while he is in high school, or even before. Parents often assume a great deal of responsibility for their dyslexic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_432" title="432"/>child’s high school work. They will not be there in college, and it is a good idea for the dyslexic child to become familiar with and use the technology on his own while still in high school.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE</b></h2>
			<h3 class="head"><b>NOTE-TAKING</b></h3>
			<p>For dyslexic students in middle school, high school, and especially college, note-taking is of great concern. As I’ve said, students in the class are often paid by the college to take notes, which are then disseminated to dyslexic students, whose identity is kept confidential. Some popular examples of assisted technology for note-taking follow.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Livescribe Smartpen.</i> This device uses a special pen housing an infrared camera which, when coupled with the special dot-matrix paper supplied by Livescribe (which acts like a GPS for the pen), allows the smartpen to capture everything the student writes or draws on the dot-matrix paper. These notes can be uploaded directly to a computer, tablet, or smartphone, where additional software can translate the student’s written notes to digitized notes that then become searchable. A built-in microphone on the Livescribe Echo or, using Livescribe 3, the microphone on a tablet or smartphone, allows the student to record a lecture while taking notes. The recorded lecture is synchronized via Bluetooth with the student’s written notes so that the student can refer to the audio if he has missed something in the lecture. Livescribe is compatible with Mac, PC, iOS, and Android systems.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>OneNote.</i> This is another popular note-taking program that many dyslexic students use. OneNote is free and packaged with Microsoft Office for PC, Mac, iPad, and Web versions, so it is readily available to most students. It was designed for students to take notes and has a number of very useful templates, including simple lecture notes, detailed lecture notes, lecture notes and study questions, math/science class notes, and history class notes. OneNote includes text-to-speech (<i>Immersive Reader</i>) and speech-to-text (<i>Dictate</i>) as well. OneNote backs up to the Web so notes should be accessible from any device.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_433" title="433"/><i>Evernote</i> (<a href="https://evernote.com">https://evernote.com</a>). This is a popular note-taking program, too, that is accessible on any device. It is maintained in the cloud so that notes are available at all times, and it is very easy to learn. There are no predefined templates for students to use in class, but the program is so versatile that students should find it easy to create their own.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Notability.</i> This is another good choice (download at the App Store), though at the time of this writing it is compatible solely with Apple products. A nice feature of Notability is that students can record a lecture as they take notes on it and the audio is synced with what’s written. If the student has missed something, she can tap on the text input and access the recorded portion of the lecture. Notability allows inputting with both typing and handwriting using the Apple pencil.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>LIBRARIES OF DIGITIZED BOOKS AND PERIODICALS</b></h3>
			<p><i>Bookshare</i> (<a href="https://www.bookshare.org/cms">https://www.bookshare.org/cms</a>). This library has the largest collection of accessible titles—at the time of this writing, over 500,000—and is entirely free to students with dyslexia. Students register with Bookshare and then can download the books they need for school using any number of text-to-speech platforms, including a platform provided by Bookshare. Using these programs, dyslexic students are able not only to listen to books with high-quality text-to-speech voices but at the same time see highlighted words, sentences, or even whole paragraphs onscreen.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, dyslexic students who have an individualized education program (IEP, see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c33_r1.xhtml#page_469">this page</a>) are eligible to apply for digitized textbooks and other school material through Bookshare (and other libraries, including Learning Ally) from the National Instructional Materials Access Center (NIMAC), a federal agency established by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that serves as a national digital-format repository for all K–12 textbooks, workbooks, and other classroom reading materials published after 2007. NIMAC is limited to K–12 textbooks, so it does not include textbooks for college, graduate, or professional schools.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Learning Ally</i> (<a href="https://learningally.org">https://learningally.org</a>). Started over sixty years ago to help blind World War II veterans, this resource now offers the largest collection of <i>human-narrated</i> audio textbooks and literature. At one time <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_434" title="434"/>human-narrated tapes were the only source of text-to-speech, and some students still prefer the human voice. Learning Ally has more recently expanded its repertoire to include computer-generated voices, in what it refers to as VOICEtext Books. Learning Ally has a library of over 80,000 titles, mostly human-narrated books, and charges parents, college students, and adults $135 a year.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Project Gutenberg</i> (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>). This library offers over 60,000 free ebooks that can be read online or downloaded to Kindle. All books are out of copyright or in the public domain. Over time more and more books become available, and so the library is constantly expanding.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p><i>Google Books.</i> Another very important source of digitized books, this project hopes to digitize the holdings of many university libraries and began with the digitization of the University of Michigan library. Over time all books out of copyright or in the public domain will be digitized and available via a Google search.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>TEXT-TO-SPEECH</b></h3>
			<p>
				As you have learned, once a dyslexic student has accessed the digitized text he needs, the next step is to use one of the many text-to-speech apps designed for reading the texts. Previously, I mentioned the text-to-speech capability <i>Immersive Reader,</i> built into OneNote. It is now accessible on all Microsoft programs, including Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Teams, Forms, and Flipgrid, and is available on all PC, Mac, iOS, and Android systems. Some of the libraries, including Bookshare, offer free readers that can be accessed on either Apple or Windows platforms, including Android devices. One of the most popular text-to-speech apps that many dyslexic students find helpful is <i>Voice Dream Reader</i> (<a href="http://www.voicedream.com">www.voicedream.com</a>), available to both Apple and Android users. Voice Dream Reader is very versatile, can automatically download from libraries, including Bookshare, and uses a large number of increasingly humanlike digitized voices. A very nice feature of Voice Dream Reader is synchronized highlighting of words, sentences, and paragraphs, depending on the reader’s preferences. It will also look up words in a dictionary. As noted earlier, it is possible that in middle school and high school, seeing the words smoothly synchronized with speech improves <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_435" title="435"/>comprehension and knowledge retention. Similar to other text-to-speech programs, Voice Dream Reader allows the reader to pause and rewind; to change speed, font, size, spacing, and color for optimal readability; to highlight; and to take notes. Voice Dream Reader can read just about anything that contains text and loads from anywhere, including note-taking programs and any website. A companion app, <i>Voice Dream Scanner,</i> will digitize to your smartphone any document and make it available for text-to-speech.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another very popular text- to-speech is <i>Kurzweil firefly</i> (<a href="https://www.kurzweiledu.com/k3000-firefly/overview.html">https://www.kurzweiledu.com/k3000-firefly/overview.html</a>). Kurzweil was one of the first systems developed to convert text to speech, and has been made more accessible using the Web. Kurzweil will operate on all Mac and PC devices, including iOS and Android systems. Many voices are available here as well. The system is quite expensive for an individual to purchase, but many high schools and universities have the system in place and make it available to dyslexic students at no charge.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other text-to-speech programs that many dyslexic students have found helpful are <i>Read &amp; Write Gold</i> (<a href="https://www.texthelp.com/en-us/products/read-write">https://www.texthelp.com/en-us/products/read-write</a>) and <i>Read: Aloud</i> (<a href="https://learningtools.donjohnston.com">https://learningtools.donjohnston.com</a>). Many high schools and colleges have purchased one of these programs, which have many similarities to Kurzweil, and each can be used on Apple, Windows, and Android systems. Another popular text-to-speech is <i>Natural Reader</i> (<a href="https://www.naturalreaders.com/software">https://www.naturalreaders.com/software</a>), used on PC, iOS, and Android systems. One version of the system is free, and more versatile versions cost about $10. Upgrades of the voices are more expensive. The program is very popular with college students.</p>
			<p class="indent">For dyslexic students, it is often helpful to use speech-to-text programs to get oral material into a digitized text format. Many cell phones use programs like this to answer emails and seem to work reasonably well. <i>Dictate,</i> packaged free with the Microsoft Office suite of programs including Word, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Outlook, is now available for use on Apple, PC, and any device using iOS or Android systems. Another commonly used speech-to-text program is <i>Dragon,</i> from Nuance, which has a number of versions, some with very specialized vocabularies for professional use, such as medical and legal. Read &amp; Write Gold and Voice Dream also have speech-to-text capability. Even newer speech-to-text programs may change the landscape dramatically. Programs such as <i><a href="http://Otter.ai">Otter.ai</a>, Descript,</i> and <i>Rav</i> now offer speech-to-text transcription very rapidly and very economically with a high degree of accuracy. Though the learning curve for speech-to-text programs <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_436" title="436"/>may be intimidating, know that it is surmountable, and the programs may be helpful for dyslexic students.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>OTHER HELPFUL APPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DYSLEXIA</b></h3>
			<p><i>Quizlet,</i> basically an electronic version of flash cards, is very helpful for learning math, foreign languages, geography, and many other subjects. It’s very easy to make your own set of flash cards for subjects you or your child might need, but a major advantage of Quizlet is that other users of it, primarily teachers, have made their flash-card sets available for anyone to use. As one very successful dyslexic college student told me, “Flash cards help so much, especially if you write them yourself, because it creates an image in your head. When I’m in an exam, if I don’t remember it, then sometimes I’m able to close my eyes and re-picture the card, and that helps a lot.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>CliffsNotes</i> are known to all students, especially dyslexic ones. Now owned by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, these study guides are available for numerous books and topics. Helpful for dyslexic students, the text that is downloaded is already digitized and can be inserted into any of the text-to-speech programs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another useful group of programs are those relating to <i>schedules and to-do lists,</i> and these are readily available on both Outlook and Google platforms. <i>Wunderlist</i> (<a href="https://www.wunderlist.com">https://www.wunderlist.com</a>) is another app that students find helpful to organize all their to-do lists. This free app works with Apple, Windows, and Android devices.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>SensusAccess</i> (<a href="https://sensusaccess.com">https://sensusaccess.com</a>), which is free, allows students to automatically convert documents into a range of alternate media, including audiobooks (MP3 and DAISY), ebooks (EPUB, EPUB3, and Mobi), and digital Braille. The service can also be used to convert inaccessible documents such as image-only PDF files, JPG pictures, and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations into more accessible formats. The student loads the file he wants converted, sends it off, and receives the converted file via email.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Textbook scanning</i> services are of great help to many dyslexic students in high school and college. At the college level, this service may be performed by the office of disability services. Otherwise, a number of private vendors (for example, <i>Blue Leaf</i> book scanning, <a href="http://www.blueleaf-book-scanning.com">www.blueleaf-book-scanning.com</a>) will scan the textbook or chapters so that the digitized book or chapters are accessible on the text-to-speech programs noted above.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, especially for younger children, an increasing number of apps that help students learn <i>common words</i> are available. I am indebted to Professor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_437" title="437"/>Emerita Elaine Cheesman, who noted many of these on her <i>App Chat</i> blog. The apps listed below are all downloadable from the App Store for iOS devices. They include apps such as <i>Fry words</i> and the more difficult <i>Fry words Ninje,</i> which help children learn the thousand most commonly used words in written text. An additional list of 220 commonly used words, excluding nouns, is featured in <i>Sight Words by Photo Touch.</i> Dr. Cheesman also noted several apps that are designed to help teach preschoolers the fundamentals of reading. These include <i>Handwriting Without Tears: Wet-Dry-Try, Partners in Rhyme,</i> and <i>OG Card Deck.</i> Just as a reminder, parents may want to consider the computer interactive programs effective for very young at-risk readers: <i>Headsprout, Ooka Island,</i> and <i>Lexia Core5 Reading.</i> These programs are more fully discussed on <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page_215">this page</a>.</p>
