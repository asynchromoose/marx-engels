			<p>
				Breaking the reading code allows a child to cross the threshold into the world of reading. But learning to read marks only the beginning of a continuing process. Just as we now understand how a child first learns to read, a clear picture has emerged of how a child becomes a <i>skilled</i> reader. Surprisingly, it involves increasing focus on the details—the letters making up a word.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-79"/>When a child first begins to read, the so-called <i>logographic stage,</i> he does not use knowledge of letter names or letter sounds to “read” a word. We are all familiar with four- and five-year-olds “reading” familiar signs, like <span class="smallcaps">STOP</span> or <span class="smallcaps">MCDONALD’S</span>, or words on boxes of breakfast cereal. <span id="ftn-80"/>We now know that these very young children are simply relying on visual cues of various sorts, like the shape of the red stop sign or the famous golden arches. In one study, although researchers had pasted a <i>Coca-Cola</i> logo over a Rice Krispies box, the majority of preschoolers continued to “read” it as Rice Krispies. This level of reader will recognize only a few words, invariably associated with a highly distinctive visual cue, which they have memorized. Using such arbitrary cues is obviously of limited value. <span id="ftn-81"/>Children can memorize hundreds of words, but by the time a child reaches fifth grade he will come across as many as ten thousand new words as he reads during the school year. At that point, relying on memorization simply won’t do. To make progress in reading, he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122" title="122"/>must learn how the alphabetic code works. Linking letters to sounds and then sounding out words is the only guarantee of being able to decode the thousands of new words a reader will encounter. This is exactly what primary-school children do.</p>
			<p class="indent">Generally during kindergarten, or as early as nursery school, as children learn letter names, a type of early or primitive reading becomes evident. <span id="ftn-82"/>If a child knows the letter names <i>j</i> and <i>l</i>, she can <i>read</i> the word <i>jail</i> by just saying the first letter name (<i>jay</i>) and the last (<i>ell</i>). This kind of reading is considered primitive because the reader is not paying attention to the full complement of letters in the word; she is relying on letter names, not letter sounds. To read effectively, a child needs to pay attention to all the letters in a written word so that she can link them to the sounds she hears in the spoken word and then decode the word. Otherwise she will confuse words that have the same initial and final consonants but differ in their interior vowels (such as <i>book</i> and <i>beak</i>). As children progress in learning to read, they rely more and more on trying to relate letters and groups of letters to the sounds they hear in spoken language.</p>
			<p class="indent">One group of researchers discovered how important it is for early readers to try to match letters to sounds even if the children don’t always succeed. They found that the kinds of errors children make while reading in the first grade offer important clues to their ability to use the phonologic code and ultimately to become proficient readers. Children whose reading errors reflected an attempt to match letters to sounds (for instance, reading <i>big</i> for <i>beg</i>) tended to be good readers at the end of the school year. Conversely, children whose errors indicated a lack of awareness of the relation of letters to sounds typically ended the year as poor readers. <span id="ftn-83"/>Such children might read <i>like</i> for <i>milk,</i> words that have some letters in common but do not sound the same. These children were not flexing their phonologic reading muscles. Parents should be concerned when their children do similar things. Above all else, the transition to being a skilled reader requires a child to focus her attention on the <i>internal</i> details of the word—on the specific letters making up the word and the sounds they represent.</p>
			<p class="indent">But reading is more than associating letters with sounds. The aspiring reader must build his reading vocabulary so that eventually he can read complex, long, or unfamiliar words. Since he has created specific neural pathways linking letters to their sounds, he has accumulated within his brain a broad range of letter-sound representations. If our young reader were to stop here, his reading would be very slow and laborious, since he would have to read <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123" title="123"/>letter by letter. But as a child reads, he builds up his vocabulary and with it enriches the neural connections linking the sounds, the letters, and the meaning of more and more words, and now things really begin to accelerate. You will recall the interactive theory I presented earlier: that the neural mechanisms for the elements of reading (phonology, orthography, semantics) can be thought of as distributed patterns of neural activity representing each of these elements. In other words, multiple neural pathways must be activated and then joined together in order to recognize a word. The more the child reads, the more he develops each of these pathways, so that they are not only robust but can now rapidly come together to identify a word.</p>
			<p class="indent">The child goes from linking images of individual letters associated with specific sounds to linking larger and larger chunks of printed material—common letters that frequently go together (<i>-at, -gh, -th</i>) and larger groups of letters that recur (<i>-ight, -eight, -ought</i>). With time, after the child has read many, many books and come across and successfully decoded hundreds of words again and again, he has created increasingly stronger linkages for more and more words. All the child needs to do now is to look at the printed word on the page and well-developed neural linkages are activated so that the sounds, letters, and meaning of the word are instantaneously integrated and the word identified. As I noted earlier, as a person becomes proficient in reading, the different kinds of relevant information—the word’s spelling, its pronunciation, and its meaning—are more tightly linked together as part of the same resonating neural circuit. Once you plug into the word, the whole circuit lights up and the word is immediately recognized and understood. A skilled reader has a huge internal dictionary of words whose features are rapidly integrated so the word is identified.</p>
			<p class="indent">The beauty of this process is that it allows the reader to decipher and read a word that she has never before encountered. She sees a word, scans all the letters, and in essence asks herself, <i>Do any of the letters fall into a familiar pattern? Do they resemble letter groups—parts of words—that I’ve encountered?</i> If so, she is able to take these letter patterns and connect them to a known pronunciation. For example, if she sees the unfamiliar printed word <i>architect,</i> she may know that the letters <i>t-e-c-t</i> go together and how they are pronounced. She may also know from experience that the letters <i>a-r-c-h</i> are often grouped together and that <i>arch</i> sounds either like the arch of your foot or like Noah’s Ark. She tries to pronounce the unknown word both ways, <i>arch-itect</i> and <i>ar-ki-tect,</i> and uses the surrounding text to judge which pronunciation fits. From the context she realizes that the word is <i>architect</i>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124" title="124"/>meaning a designer of buildings, and is pronounced like <i>ark (ar-ki-tect).</i> Once she has successfully decoded this word, it joins the other words in her lexicon. Each time she reads the word again, the connections between how the word sounds, how it looks, and what it means become more integrated and more quickly recognized. After correctly reading it several times, she will activate the linkages connecting its spelling, pronunciation, and meaning, instantly adding it to the growing list of words she reads fluently.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fluency—reading words quickly, smoothly, and with good expression—is acquired by practice, by reading words over and over again. This is consistent with what we know about neural circuits that are reinforced and strengthened by repetition. A reader must have four or more successful encounters with a new word to be able to read it fluently. (As I will discuss later, I use the term <i>fluent</i> to describe how a skilled reader reads; I reserve the term <i>automatic</i> for describing the neural processes that underlie fluent reading.) Once a word can be read fluently, the reader no longer has any need to rely on context. Fluency does not describe a stage in which a reader is able to decode <i>all</i> words instantly; rather, we become fluent word by word. Studies in which the eye movements of readers are tracked have shown that a skilled reader pauses at between 50 and 80 percent of the words in a text. He needs to fixate on the word, essentially to scan the word in, but does so very, very quickly, because the words—their spelling patterns and pronunciations—are well known to him. If you meet someone on the street you don’t know well, you may continue to stare at him until some shred of recognition appears; however, if you know someone well, a glance is enough.</p>
			<p class="indent">Initially, small common words are the ones read instantly. As the reader progresses, larger and more complicated words, including words that may appear infrequently, join the words read at a glance. Although children’s books may contain thousands of words, only a relative few of them make up most of the text. In the primary grades, about one hundred words make up 50 percent of the entire text, one thousand words 75 percent of the text, and five thousand words about 90 percent of the text. The remaining 10 percent of the words occur infrequently. Since as few as one hundred words make up half of the words in a typical book for schoolchildren, you can understand how boys and girls who are good readers can become fluent quite quickly and are soon reading books with relative ease.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition to reading words accurately and quickly, a skilled reader understands what he reads. <span id="ftn-84"/>Reading comprehension develops gradually, so that over time the balance tips from learning mostly from listening to learning <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125" title="125"/>through reading. Thus the beginning reader learns much more from what he hears than from what he reads in print. This gap narrows in the primary grades as the child becomes a better reader. By seventh grade the balance begins to favor reading; at this point the reader is said to have <i>mature</i> reading comprehension. Gradually the student gains more and more from reading, so that by the time he is in college most knowledge and vocabulary is acquired through reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">A large vocabulary is a key element in facilitating reading comprehension; in turn, reading itself is a powerful influence in developing a child’s vocabulary. Indeed, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of reading to a child’s intellectual growth. <span id="ftn-85"/>Reading researchers Anne Cunningham and Keith Stanovich have emphasized how dependent a child’s vocabulary is on reading. A child learns about seven new words a day, which amounts to a staggering three thousand words a year. To acquire a new word for his vocabulary, a child must scrutinize the inner details of the word and not gloss over it. For the most part, analyzing each letter and letter group in a word is the way an accurate representation is formed and the means of having a new written word become a part of the child’s reading vocabulary.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-86"/>Books offer almost three times as many interesting or complicated words—words outside the general vocabulary of a sixth-grader—compared to even the most educated speakers. Books for adult readers have about fifty rare words for every one thousand words; the spoken language of a college graduate has only about seventeen rare words per one thousand spoken words. Children’s books, too, “have 50 percent more rare words in them than does the conversation of college graduates.” So simply relying on alternatives, ranging from even the most sophisticated conversations to the very popular YouTube videos to increase vocabulary, falls short of what can be gained through reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">The powerful influence of early reading on later reading and vocabulary growth was demonstrated when researchers had children keep diaries of how they spent their time when they were not in school. As shown in Figure 35, the very best readers, those children who scored better than 90 percent of their peers on reading tests, read for more than twenty minutes a day (about 1.8 million words a year), while those at the fiftieth percentile read only 4.6 minutes a day (282,000 words yearly). The poorest readers, those children reading below the tenth percentile, read less than <i>one minute</i> each day (a meager 8,000 words a year) and would require one year to read what the best readers read in two days.</p>

			</figure>
			<p class="indent">Given such worrisome consequences of poor reading, is it possible to identify early on a child who is not on track to becoming a skilled reader? Fortunately, the process of becoming a skilled reader is well mapped out. It consists of a series of discrete and discernible accomplishments, ones you can look for and monitor to determine if your child is on track. To help you do this, I’ve included a chart laying out the expected developmental sequence and timing of specific reading-related skills or <span id="ftn-87"/>benchmarks. Keep in mind, though, that these are general guidelines for the typical child, and they are certainly not written in stone. Each of these expected steps represents a single point. What we are looking for is a series of points that together, over time, can help to affirm that your child is on course or to alert you early on that there might be a problem. Because teaching and learning experiences influence phonologic skills, the child’s level of schooling, rather than age, may at times be the more appropriate guide to expectations.</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>DYSLEXIC READERS</b></h2>
			<p>For dyslexic readers the process of learning to read and of becoming a skilled reader is torturously slow. Benchmarks are significantly delayed. At the beginning, difficulties linking letters to sounds interfere with learning to read. Over time, as the dyslexic learns to read, she, too, begins to build up her neural pathways linking the way the word looks and sounds and what it means. Unfortunately, the dyslexic reader may correctly connect only a few of the letters in a word to their sounds. As a result, the neural connections for that word are imperfect and incomplete. Later on, when she comes across that printed word again, she struggles to recognize it.</p>
			<p class="indent">As I said, part of the process of becoming a skilled reader is creating more detailed and robust linkages representing each of the elements making up a word. Dyslexic readers generally require many more exposures to a printed word over a much longer period of time before the neural pathways are well <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131" title="131"/>developed and come together each time they encounter that word. In some instances, these connections continue to be less than robust, impeding the ready retrieval of words. As a result, even when dyslexic readers are able to decode words accurately, they are still not quick in their reading of these words.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a further consequence of their imperfect connections linking each of the elements of a word (the way the word looks, the way it sounds, and what it means), dyslexic readers often have to continue to rely on context to get to a word’s meaning. This means that the identification of the word is limited to that particular context and cannot be generalized to other situations. Because a dyslexic reader often gets to the meaning without having first fully decoded the word, the linkages between the way the word looks, the way it sounds, and what it means are not reinforced and remain imperfect. Next time he comes across that word, it is often as if he has never seen it before, and he will have to go through the same exercise of using context to get to the word’s meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">Context also explains a common puzzling symptom of dyslexia. Many dyslexic readers complain of difficulties in reading the little words, such as <i>in, on, the, that,</i> and <i>an.</i> The parents of a nine-year-old dyslexic boy, Noah, described his peculiar difficulty with reading small words while at the same time “reading without apparent hesitation longer, more difficult words, such as <i>museum</i> and <i>Metropolitan Opera</i> and shorter words representing <i>things,</i> such as <i>tree, bat,</i> etc. Our son, a baseball fan, when in third grade could read <i>Metropolitan Stadium,</i> but the word <i>on</i> gave him real difficulties.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Since dyslexic readers rely so much on context, it is often difficult to figure out a small, so-called <i>function</i> word, whose meaning cannot be gleaned from the context. For example, a ball could be <i>on, over,</i> or <i>under</i> the table, which makes it difficult to decide which of these choices is the one the author intended. For the same reason, a dyslexic might be able to read words such as <i>tree</i> and <i>bat</i> because they represent concrete objects that can be predicted from the text as well as visualized. The small function words are so neutral that it is difficult for the dyslexic child to find something in the text to help him anchor and remember the word.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, the ability of a child—say, one who is an avid baseball fan—to read the name of a local baseball stadium and not simpler words argues for the importance of reading material that is relevant and meaningful to the reader. Rather than having to be pushed, he finds the content so inherently interesting that he is pulled into the reading material. Whether it’s science <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132" title="132"/>or baseball, even those with the most severe dyslexia can learn to read, not only decoding isolated words but comprehending the materials—for after all, this is the pull. After Charles Schwab and I gave a joint talk on dyslexia at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, he responded to a question about how he reads. To paraphrase Mr. Schwab, “I take a book, <i>Shogun,</i> with me when I go on vacation. I haven’t made much progress getting through it. You give me <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and I eagerly go through it cover to cover, and pretty quickly.”</p>

			<h2 class="head"><b>JUDGING YOUR CHILD’S PROGRESS</b></h2>
			<p>Knowing how skilled reading develops and when to expect the successive milestones characteristic of skilled reading demystifies reading; it allows you to observe your child’s reading in a new, informed way. You know when to expect your child to walk and to talk, and now you will be able to know the milestones of reading—what to anticipate in your child’s reading development and when to expect it. You will also learn how to recognize the danger signs—the specific clues that should alert you that reading is not progressing smoothly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Just as a parent would not think of ignoring her child’s scheduled physical with his pediatrician, every parent should regularly observe her child reading. Given the high prevalence of dyslexia, it is much more likely for your child to have a reading problem than almost any other physical problem for which he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" title="133"/>is being checked. I recommend reading with your child as often as possible, at least several evenings a week. Part of that time should be devoted to hearing your child read to you. Listening to your child read prevents a problem from developing without your knowledge; moreover, it’s fun. I have wonderful memories of reading with my children, and although they are now adults, they often surprise me with details of stories we read together years ago.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="indent">While most children with dyslexia are not identified until third grade, the ideal time to identify and help a child is during the very first few years of school, which is why I have concentrated so much on clues that are easy to observe during kindergarten and grades one and two. As I have already noted and will elaborate on, good data show that an achievement gap between dyslexic and typical readers is already present and detectable by the end of first grade. This adds even more incentive to screen for and identify dyslexia as early as possible. I developed the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ in response to the finding that the achievement gap is present so early, which brought home to me the critical need to determine if a child is at-risk for dyslexia. Given the availability of a rapid, evidence-based screener and the high cost of not identifying dyslexia early, waiting is no longer acceptable. Not only is the achievement gap evident as early as first grade, but reading intervention studies have documented over and over again that while improvement in decoding can occur, there is little improvement in reading fluency the longer one waits to begin intervention. The message for parents is: If you suspect your child has dyslexia, act now.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>THIRD GRADE AND ABOVE</b></h3>
			<p>
				As your child progresses through third and higher grades, your focus shifts from wondering if she is learning to read to wanting to know if she is learning to read a critical core of words fluently. Reading is changing in character now. Words are more complicated, and there are many more of them. In class the emphasis is less on teaching reading than it is on using reading to gain information. <span id="ftn-88"/>So it is easy to understand why dyslexia is so often noticed and diagnosed for the first time in third grade.</p>
			<p class="indent">Since dyslexic readers often do not use a decoding strategy to identify a word and instead rely heavily on the surrounding context to figure out its meaning, you should notice if your daughter uses word substitutions. These replacement words make sense in the context of the passage but do not resemble the pronunciation of the original word. For example, a child might <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135" title="135"/>read <i>car</i> for <i>automobile.</i> Making repeated substitutions is a sure sign that the reader is using context to guess at the meaning of words she has been unable to decode. Because these substitutions often make literal sense, you may find it helpful to obtain a second copy of the books your child is reading so that you can look at each word as she reads it. Otherwise you may not always notice that she is substituting one word for another.</p>
			<p class="indent">Pay attention to the overall rhythm of her reading—is it smooth or hesitant? She should be reading most of the words on the page fluently, with appropriate expression. Does she tend to trip over the words instead? Slow, choppy oral reading with words omitted, substituted, or misspoken are important clues that a third-grader is not on track for becoming a skilled reader. Such children are in terror of being called on to read aloud and often go to great lengths to avoid such embarrassment; they often stay home, ask to leave the room, or act out and have to be sent out of the room. I’ve heard from more than a few dyslexic students that they would rather be sent to the principal’s office for bad behavior than have to stand up and struggle through reading a passage aloud and face embarrassment and the taunts of classmates.</p>
			<p class="indent">Poor spelling is very often a sign of dyslexia. Spelling and reading are intimately linked. To spell correctly, a child relies on the neural connections he has formed between the word’s letters and sounds, and, as you have read, these are imperfect in dyslexia. Spelling difficulties may be an indication that the child is not forming robust connections between the letters and sounds of that word. As a child who is dyslexic goes on in school, difficulties with spelling persist. In fact, spelling errors may remain long after a dyslexic child (or adult) has learned to decode most words accurately. Analysis of spelling errors often reveals omissions of entire blocks of sounds or confusion of the order of sounds. Mark, a thirtysomething Canadian, reflects the experience of many dyslexics when he says, “My spelling is atrocious…. So often I compensate by using a smaller word or words [often a poor compromise]. Spell-checkers are a great help, but not always. Often the spelling is mangled so much that the spell-checker can’t find a match.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Children who are dyslexic frequently have abominable handwriting—a problem that continues into adulthood. Word processing is often a relief to dyslexic children and adults alike (perhaps it is the freedom of not actually having to form the letters that is so liberating). Bruce Miller, who is dyslexic and head of his own computer programming company, describes his experiences with the keyboard: “None of my friends type as fast as I do. I think it’s because I memorize the words, not the parts. So I’m just reproducing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136" title="136"/>words. I guess I’m really just memorizing all the words and using them as tokens both for input and output.” I think Bruce is absolutely right. He is not interacting with the word, nor is he sounding it out; he is acting as a pass-through—just lifting the word as a whole (think of a pdf) and placing it onto the page via the keyboard.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p>The inability to read fluently leaves its mark on young adults who are dyslexic. By adolescence, good readers have created strong neural connections linking the elements making up each of thousands of words, allowing them to read each of these words fluently. The connections are there and ready to go. Reading is now a pleasure. Decoding is not a problem for them, so their energies can be devoted to thinking about what they are reading. Bright dyslexic adolescents love to think, but for them it’s hard to take in the raw material—the printed words—that serve as the source of inspiration for new ideas. They must devote their full concentration to decoding words. As noted previously, many are surprised that in dyslexia, comprehension is typically good. (In fact, some children may have adequate decoding but impaired comprehension; this is not dyslexia but rather a separate entity, Specific-Reading Comprehension Deficits [S-RCD].)</p>
			<p class="indent">However, accessing comprehension may be quite hard work, since so much of the dyslexic reader’s attention is being siphoned off to decode the individual words. Reflecting the lack of fluency, they read slowly—a hallmark of dyslexia. Good readers are fluent; that is, they can read rapidly and automatically. This means that these readers do not require or need to dip into their attention resources. Let’s say that each of us has a bucket of attention available. For typical readers this bucket remains relatively untouched and full during reading. In contrast, the dyslexic reader does not read automatically but rather <i>manually,</i> which means she has to continually dip into her bucket of attention to support her lack of automatic reading. All the effort of reading required of her is very fatiguing, and eventually her bucket of attention runs out.</p>
			<p class="indent">The lack of fluency causes significant problems for dyslexic adolescents as they try to cope with large volumes of written work. Homework assignments take a great deal of time to complete and often go unfinished. Fluency is what binds a reader to the text. If a child cannot effortlessly decode a critical mass of words on the page, it is difficult for him to engage with the text. He will be at odds with it. I frequently hear, “My son is not paying attention <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137" title="137"/>to his homework.” If you cannot penetrate and decode enough words on a page, reading is like gliding over ice: You may never get into the words and, of course, their meanings. Why would someone continue to pay attention to words that she is unable to penetrate? Would you continue to read what was in essence a foreign text that you could not decipher? After a while a dyslexic reader may consume much of her available attention and start daydreaming, staring out the window, and then giving up.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is important for the child’s teacher and her parents to be aware of what I refer to as the <i>empty bucket</i> syndrome. The child has not decided to willfully stop paying attention but rather has simply and involuntarily run out of attention. Just as a car that runs out of fuel on a highway comes to a halt, so a dyslexic reader who runs out of attention has little or no choice but to stop reading. Far too often, unfortunately, she is chastised and even punished for “not paying attention.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Given this new understanding, as you notice your student or child starting to lose attention, give her a break from reading. Wait ten or twenty minutes and then try going back to reading. Each child is different and will require her own amount of time to refuel her attention supply. Depending on the specific situation, it might be an optimal time to talk about the story she has just tried to read, its theme, characters, and what she thinks will happen next. At other times it may be best to have her listen to soft, soothing music.</p>
			<p class="indent">The necessity of devoting all his attention to decoding the words on the page makes a dyslexic reader extremely vulnerable to any distraction, such as noises or movements. For him, reading is fragile, and the process can be disrupted at any moment. Any little sound that draws his attention away from the page is a threat to his ability to maintain his reading. He needs all his attention to try to decipher the printed words. (In contrast, a fluent reader has attention to spare, so room noises are not likely to interfere with his reading.) The practical consequences of this fragility is that dyslexic readers often require an extremely quiet room in which to do their reading or to take tests. Music can be on, as long as it has no lyrics; speech always distracts us. On the other hand, music without words can be supportive.</p>
			<p class="indent">The difficulties a dyslexic reader has in gaining command of the phonology of his primary language are exacerbated when he tries to learn a new language. Persistent difficulties in learning a foreign language provide an important clue that a student may be dyslexic.</p>
			<p class="indent">There is one final clue to dyslexia in children and adults alike: the fact that they say they are in pain. Dyslexia inflicts pain. It represents a major <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138" title="138"/>assault on self-esteem. In grade-school children, this may express itself as a reluctance to attend school, or moodiness, or spoken expressions such as “I’m dumb” or “I get teased a lot.” Adolescents may develop feelings of shame and work hard to hide their dyslexia by avoiding school, pretending to have forgotten assignments, doing anything not to read aloud in class. Adult dyslexics invariably harbor deep pain and sadness reflecting years of assaults to their sense of self-worth.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the same time, I want to make clear to the dyslexic reader that in spite of these difficulties, he shouldn’t be discouraged. The work of one reading researcher, in fact, offers great encouragement. Rosalie Fink has studied a very accomplished group of dyslexic men and women whose honors include a Nobel Prize and election to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine. Many of these people, even as adults, continue to struggle with getting to the sounds of words and continue to rely on context to get to meaning. The late Baruj Benacerraf, a 1980 Nobel laureate in medicine or physiology and a dyslexic, commented: “Even today, when I can’t figure out a word, I guess from the context. Yes, I guess what makes sense.” His daughter, Beryl Benacerraf, a physician and a highly respected professor of radiology at Harvard, is also dyslexic. Clearly, dyslexic men and women are able to make significant, even profound contributions.</p>
