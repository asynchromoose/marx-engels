			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>IN COLLEGE: GETTING STARTED</b></h1>
			<p>Be prepared. Beginning college is a big change for all students and even more so for students who are dyslexic, such as Elise.</p>
			<p class="indent">Elise explains:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>You don’t realize how comfortable you are in your old routines until they’re taken away and you’re in a completely new environment. For example, you’re not going to be home by yourself doing homework, but you’re going to be in the library doing work with people who don’t have dyslexia. You become aware of things you as a dyslexic have to do that nondyslexics don’t have to do. At home you didn’t see that others didn’t have to do what you must do—get a handout and have to go get it scanned; other people don’t have to do that. You didn’t see them just whipping it out and reading it very easily.</p>
				<p class="indent">It comes more at the beginning of the semester, when you have so much more work to do. You have to look at the books and find out how you’re going to get them transformed from text to speech, and just all the extra little things that people who have dyslexia have to do to get the alternative text. So when you’re going to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_385" title="385"/>resource office and all your friends are having dinner, you’re like, <i>Well, this sucks.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Yet at the end of the semester Elise got two A’s and two A—’s.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>TRADEOFFS: ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL</b></h3>
			<p>There are only so many hours in the day, and as you breathe in the excitement of being in college, there is so much you’ve been thinking about doing. You’re determined that even if schoolwork takes you much longer than it takes your classmates, you still want to have new experiences, make new friends, be a part of a group, socialize, attend events, and perhaps try out for a team. The trick, of course, is balancing all these activities. (This is one reason it is so important to get yourself as prepared as possible during high school.) As Julia, a college freshman, told me,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>This semester, my second at college, has definitely been hard, but socially it’s been better. It’s a weird tradeoff. I joined a sorority. I know that in college I wanted to be around people more and have a bigger group of friends than I did in high school. It’s so exciting! I’m doing all these things that I would never have expected I would do, which is what I also had as my goal to do in college.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Vito is a sophomore and captain of the crew team at Iona College, where he devotes four hours each day to crewing. His advice to incoming dyslexic students very much aligns with Julia’s:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I would say do a sport, because if you don’t do a sport, then all it is is academics, and then you’re missing out on so much that college is all about. So do a sport, do a club, make friends, do something. All the time. You won’t be sorry.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Here’s what you can do to make your college experience work for you. Be sure to:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">

A good time to do this is <i>early <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_386" title="386"/>summer,</i> before school begins. Once school is in session and students begin streaming in and course selection begins in earnest, the college scene becomes quite hectic, with much confusion and very busy staffers. Introduce yourself to the staff and meet with them. This is a good time to help the office get to know you, your educational experiences, your dyslexia, and which accommodations have and have not been effective. Ask what documentation is required and what method—mail, email, in person—is preferred. Provide the office with the report that established your diagnosis and include recommendations for accommodations. Ask any questions you may have. Learn if you need to get further testing; this can be completed prior to the start of school. The office might recommend accommodations you have never considered that turn out to be quite helpful.</p>

			<p class="indent">Here’s a checklist that you can use when meeting with the resource office staff. Add other items that you have an interest in.</p>

				<div class="squeeze squeeze100">
					<img alt="" class="image" id="Page_387_img01" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_387_Image_0001.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">Policies regarding accommodations in college are pretty straightforward. If the school receives federal funds, that institution is required to provide reasonable accommodations to a student with a disability. The student’s evaluation is reviewed to determine if it is complete, timely, and meets the school’s accommodations guidelines. There is no firm published rule concerning how recent an evaluation must be. In a case involving accommodations and Boston University, a judge ruled that an assessment taken as long as five years before should be acceptable. According to the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD), documentation of the need for accommodations can take a variety of forms, including the student’s description of her own experiences with test-taking and/or documentation from reports, school records, assessments, or an Individualized Education <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_388" title="388"/>Program (IEP) or 504 plan (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c33_r1.xhtml#page_468">this page</a> for details). The student should give serious thought to relaying which specific prior accommodations were effective and which were not.</p>
			<p class="indent">Should a student have to retake a test or have an evaluation for the first time, be aware that this can be quite expensive, often running to thousands of dollars. Some schools provide an evaluation at no cost. Other schools offer financial support. Many schools offer neither and the student must cover the cost himself.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>ACCOMMODATIONS</b></h3>
			<p>Although there is variability among colleges and within specific majors, overall the most common accommodations provided are</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>A note-taker.</i> The process is straightforward. Another student in the course is recruited as a paid peer note-taker. Most often it is the professor (not knowing the identity of the recipient) who makes the announcement. When completed, the notes are sent to the resource office, which in turn distributes them to the recipient. Confidentiality is maintained at all schools so that no one other than the recipient and resource office staff is aware of who is receiving notes. Typically the note-taker uses a laptop, ensuring that the notes are legible and easy to read.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">In the near future many classes may well be recorded. This optimizes a professor’s time, eliminating the need to repeat a lecture while allowing students to play it back as often as needed. Lectures may be recorded visually as well. Recorded lectures would obviously be of special benefit to students who are dyslexic.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">In some institutions the future is already here. A service recently established at George Washington University (GW) in Washington, DC, is known as Lecture Capture. Professors can request to be enrolled and scheduled in a Lecture Capture classroom, where their lecture is automatically recorded and distributed to their students. Some of these classrooms also possess video recording capabilities. GW uses the technology wisely, with both students and professors benefiting. For example, students <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_389" title="389"/>can bookmark these lectures so that they can easily return to sections for further review or clarification. Professors can monitor how many students viewed a specific lecture, how often they viewed the video, and how much of it they watched. Professors feared attendance would be adversely affected and are relieved that this has not been the case. In fact, they feel that students are getting a much deeper understanding of the materials more quickly.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Extra time with a separate, quiet room for exams.</i> Once your evaluation has been reviewed and approved by the resource office, obtaining extra time for exams is straightforward. Additional time ranges from 25 percent to double time; typically time and a half is recommended and provided.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Use of a keyboard (basic laptops with Word and no Internet access).</i> Use of laptops particularly, and at times only, for exams is becoming increasingly accepted. Both professors and those who grade the tests appreciate being able to read what is written easily rather than having to deal with bad or hurried handwriting. An additional advantage is that the test responses placed on the computer are saved, ensuring that those exams will not be lost. There are advantages for the student, too: She can cut and paste and reorganize what she has written and do so much faster than by hand.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Use of laptops in class is an entirely different issue. Professors are increasingly disallowing them during lectures, especially if they take place in a large lecture hall, because they have found students abusing the privilege by sending and receiving emails and looking at Facebook. You can understand how professors find that to be rude and discouraging. However, exceptions may be made for dyslexic students who need their laptops for taking notes. As in other areas, there is great variability among schools, and even within schools among professors.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Text-to-speech recorded books.</i> Federal law and regulations, including the Chafee Amendment to the U.S. Copyright Law, Section 504, and the IDEA, support and allow the production and use of recorded printed material to be converted into audio for students with print disabilities, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_390" title="390"/>including dyslexic students. Furthermore, Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) both prohibit discrimination against those with a disability. Under these laws, states and local districts must ensure equal educational opportunity to students with a recognized disability by providing <i>accessible instructional materials,</i> often referred to as AIM. The resource office of most colleges has a mechanism for converting text to speech.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Entering freshmen find that college requires a surprisingly large amount of reading. There are a number of approaches to dealing with this onslaught, including</p>
				<ul class="ul">
					<li>making sure not to register for too many heavy reading courses in one semester</li>
					<li>developing the knack of skimming and understanding that not every word in an assignment has to be read</li>
					<li>using text-to-speech software. Digitized texts are available from the publisher, but given that students are often rushed from the time of shopping to the time of finally registering for a course, it simply takes too long to obtain the digitized text from the publisher before classes begin. Yale’s functional adaptation to this predicament has been to send the books off to the school’s printer, where they slash the binding and high-speed scan the pages into a digitized format. Students seem to be very satisfied with this arrangement.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="list0_indent">At the University of Pennsylvania, if the book is available in audio format, the disability office will help a student approved for text-to-speech get access to it through the publisher. If not, the office will convert the textbook or PDF into audio format. The office will also convert a pamphlet or similar material into an audio format. Cornerstone at Washington University and the Office of Accessible Education at Stanford University have streamlined the process a bit further. At Stanford the software is distributed so it is all on the mainframe computers and readily accessible to the students. These institutions are exemplars of what students can and should expect from universities across the country. Not all colleges are on board with services such as these, but many more than you might think are. Services for students with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_391" title="391"/>documented dyslexia are moving forward at an incredible pace, and the vast majority of institutions are working to understand and respond to the needs of these students.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Be aware that students have very differing opinions of the usefulness of text-to-speech software. Some students suggest that its availability allows them to begin to deal with the tremendous and often unexpectedly intense reading load they are faced with as a college student. However, as one resource office professional said, “Many students who are early-diagnosed don’t gravitate to it because it’s one more thing to add to the mix of their life. They don’t see the advantage of it.” Some students describe “zoning out” while listening. Others may use the software only for some courses, arguing that it takes too long.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">One disability office professional told me,</p>
				<p class="list0_nonindent spaceabove">I know that we have a larger number of students who are approved for this than actually use it. Some may use it when freshmen and sophomores and then, as classes change and the nature of what they do changes, find they have less use for this technology. Or, in classes that don’t do as much reading or are more project-based or discussion-based, then maybe that is the reason behind why we don’t see as many students using text-to-speech technology.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent spaceabove">My advice, based on speaking to professionals and students, is to give this technology a try, and do so prior to college entry.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 class="head"><b>FOREIGN-LANGUAGE WAIVERS AND SUBSTITUTIONS</b></h3>
			<p>
				Many dyslexic students have had unnecessarily stressful experiences in trying to have their high school understand their need to be granted a partial waiver of the foreign-language requirement. Overall you will find a much more positive experience in college, where a great many (but not all) schools grant such waivers or substitutions. It is now part of the culture at Yale to be open to such requests. The first step is for the student to submit a request to the Resource Office. This request is reviewed and then sent to us at the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity for further review and, if needed, assessment. We review the student’s history and any prior evaluations within the context of deep knowledge of the impact of dyslexia on the ability to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_392" title="392"/>access the sound system of a second language. I think our knowledge of the scientific underpinnings of dyslexia and its clinical impact allows us to feel quite comfortable in granting such partial waivers when indicated. A letter with our recommendation is sent to the dean at the head of the Committee on Honors and Academic Standing.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#c28-ftn-1" id="c28-ftn1" role="doc-noteref">*</a></sup> Once approved at this level, the student is instructed to contact the dean of his college to formally request the waiver. Together the student and his college dean then write a letter of request to the Committee on Honors and Academic Standing, which formally approves the request. The registrar is notified, because the graduation requirements in the student’s transcript have to change. At this point, the student meets with her residential college dean and selects the substitute course that would be approved. The student cannot arbitrarily select her substitute course; it must be approved by the residential college dean.</p>
			<p class="indent">At some institutions, the change in requirement is referred to as a “course substitution” instead of a waiver, but a similar process is used to obtain the substitution. First the request is made to the resource center, which helps the student apply to the Committee on Academic Standing to make the final determination. Most of the students can manage the first level of a foreign-language course, which often primarily asks the student to memorize vocabulary words. However, dyslexic students run into trouble when they have to speak and understand the language. Do your research. Some schools, like Stanford, very rarely waive the requirement. In some engineering programs, including the one at Cornell University, foreign language is not required.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is important to know that obtaining such a partial waiver is a lengthy, detailed process. At the same time, the climate can be welcoming and understanding, with the end result that the student receives his waiver and can enroll in a course(s) that will be accessible to him, and even enjoyable.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additional accommodations include use of a calculator in the classroom and on some exams, essays instead of multiple-choice tests, and using pencil and paper rather than answering questions on a computer screen.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>INFORMING A PROFESSOR ABOUT A STUDENT’S ACCOMMODATIONS</b></h3>
			<p>
				Once a student has been approved for specific accommodations, the next step is informing the professor. To begin the process, the student goes to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_393" title="393"/>resource office and signs a release. This release gives the office permission to notify faculty of the approved accommodations. The nature of the student’s disability is kept confidential; the faculty is <i>not</i> given this information, even if they request it. A professor is informed via a form letter that the student can drop in the professor’s mailbox or hand to him or her after class; the student can also take it to the professor during office hours as a letter of introduction. Most often students hand the letter to their professor after class. However, I would suggest using the handover as an opportunity to explain that you are dyslexic and why you are requesting this specific accommodation. Students are best served by interacting with the faculty member in an ongoing way, developing a rapport. I strongly advise you to personally inform your professor at the very beginning of the semester that you are dyslexic and will be using accommodations. He will get to know you that way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Professors enjoy teaching, and especially getting to know their students. They always have office hours, and even if on some occasions you can’t make their office hours, you can contact them and ask if they have any time to meet. The response will usually be a welcoming, “Sure, let’s find a time together.”</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>CHOOSING A MAJOR AND SELECTING COURSES</b></h3>
			<p>One of the key decisions you will have is choosing a major (always keeping in mind that a major is not fixed in stone). When I ask students, “What do you, as a student who is dyslexic, wish you had known before you entered college?” I consistently hear, “I wish I had been more confident in taking risks.” Dyslexic students often feel they need to prove themselves, or are too frightened to take a risk. For instance, they choose business rather than art, which they truly want to pursue. Based on their prior experiences in school, far too many dyslexics feel they are less worthy and must somehow choose the most respected major. One such student, however, had enough courage to switch his major from neuroscience to something he was good at and that really interested him: film. As a result, he is not only much happier, he is excelling academically, and far more active socially. For the first time he is relishing his college experience.</p>
			<p class="indent">Students typically register for four, sometimes five, courses each semester. My very strong recommendation for students who are dyslexic and entering college is to register for three courses, not more. There is so much change and so much adjustment called for from freshmen that time must be available to figure things out, to adapt, to determine how your new college life can best <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_394" title="394"/>work for you. At most schools a student can register for three classes and still be considered full-time. You will benefit from starting out slowly, allowing yourself to feel comfortable, and gain confidence by getting a good grade. Once you gain that confidence, your life will be a lot easier.</p>
			<p class="indent">In selecting courses, the goal is to try for a mix of demands—not too many heavy reading classes, and at the same time not a course load full of very demanding writing or term paper courses. Remind yourself, too, of what finals will be like. Ask yourself, <i>Will I have to face one final after another, especially with multiple-choice questions, or can I ease the stress by taking some classes with finals and others that may require a final project or paper?</i> Many dyslexic students have found they achieve much better results with writing papers than with answering multiple-choice questions. As one student said, “I am horrible at multiple-choice, because it requires so much reading.” Dyslexic students can be especially hard on themselves to prove they can compete. That’s not the wisest way to proceed. In selecting courses it is always helpful to do a bit of detective work and find out about potential professors’ reactions to students’ need for test accommodations. At Yale, the Nobel laureate economics professor Robert Shiller at times may actually come to the Resource Office when dyslexic students are taking final exams to be physically present and to answer any questions they may have. I am told his presence makes a tremendous difference, helping to bridge the divide separating students who require extended time and who need to take their test in the Resource Office from the remainder of the class, who take the final all together elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="indent">For courses that a student feels a bit unsure of, it’s useful to inquire if the course may be taken pass/fail. Once again, different colleges have different policies. At some institutions a student can take no more than two pass/fail courses. In some instances taking a course pass/fail is considered not an accommodation but an arrangement worked out between a student and her advisor. This arrangement has to be approved by the college administration.</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>OTHER SERVICES</b></h3>
			<p>
				In addition to the accommodations we have just discussed, schools offer a range of additional services. The University of Pennsylvania has the Weingarten Learning Resources Center, an umbrella service center providing a range of academic support services and programs to students through its two divisions. One, the Office of Student Disabilities Services, is geared to students who self-identify with a disability such as dyslexia. The other, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_395" title="395"/>the Office of Learning Resources, offers to all members of the university community professional instruction and support in strategies for reading, writing, studying, and time management, among other services. Students who are dyslexic often benefit from the services provided by each of these divisions. Professionals here, as elsewhere, have found that students with dyslexia arrive on campus thinking they are cured and don’t need support when they very much do need such support. New students who present themselves to Student Disabilities Services are referred early on to the Office of Learning Resources to support and strengthen strategies they already have developed. The learning process itself is a focus; students are instructed in how to get organized, maintain their concentration, and best demonstrate what they know.</p>
			<p class="indent">I was especially impressed by the reading support offered at Penn, even more so after I spoke to Dr. Myrna Cohen, recently retired executive director of the Weingarten Learning Resources Center and the instructor in charge of the program focused on teaching students how to be more efficient readers. Penn has a very heavy reading load, and an important goal is to make sure students are being strategic about the courses they’re choosing every semester. At the same time, Dr. Cohen helps students develop strategies for efficient and effective reading. Basically she urges students to be thoughtful about their reading, continually asking themselves, <i>Why is the professor assigning this reading in this specific course?</i> and addressing this central question by considering the whole course—for example, the syllabus, the professor’s philosophy, and class notes—as part of an integrated message or purpose.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another helpful model is found at Iona College in Westchester County, New York. There the Samuel Rudin Academic Resource Center, akin to the Weingarten Center, provides a range of services to both the full student body and, more specifically, to students who are dyslexic. The College Assistance Program (CAP) is a unique, highly specialized tutoring and support service that I became familiar with when a student I know, Vito Rocco, entered Iona. Vito, who is very bright and dyslexic, is incredibly enthusiastic about the role CAP played in making his first year at Iona successful, both personally and academically. CAP, to which students must apply for admission and for which they are charged a fee separate from tuition, offers two one-hour tutorial sessions each week; if needed, more can be arranged. The tutors at the conveniently located facility are professional learning specialists whom the student meets on an ongoing basis so that a relationship develops and the tutor gets to know and understand the student’s needs. A range of skills are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_396" title="396"/>addressed, including reading, math, writing and editing, note-taking, and test preparation and test-taking. Student and tutor form a highly interactive dyad whose focus varies depending on the student’s current needs. For example, as Vito explains,</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>one day I have a paper due for this class. I’ll bring the paper in for my tutor to look at and advise me. He’ll compliment me because I’m not too shabby at writing. But then if I make a grammar mistake, he’ll be there, because everybody makes grammar mistakes, and he’ll explain how to correct it. So it’s not like holding my hand; it’s more of pointing me where I have to go. I like that.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Vito gives another example from his history class.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I would read the textbook with my professor [tutor]. During the actual class, we had to read little passages that were online. So I would work with the tutor to read those passages with me and take notes on that. Then when we would have in-class discussions on this material, I would crush everybody on those because I actually read it. All the kids just don’t read it. And I was like, “Ha, you can read and you don’t read.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 class="head"><b>DISCLOSING THAT YOU ARE DYSLEXIC</b></h3>
			<p>Each dyslexic student must make his or her own choice on disclosure. Vito’s response was typical of many: “If they ask if I’m dyslexic, then I don’t lie, but I don’t bring it up.” When I asked Sara if she had met any students at Yale who are dyslexic, she said, “I have one other friend whom I talk to about dyslexia, but for the most part, I think people are pretty quiet about their dyslexia.”</p>
			<p class="indent">In contrast, Izer, at Penn, was open about his dyslexia. “All my fraternity brothers and friends know I am dyslexic,” he said. “I’m very open about it. I feel that by being very comfortable being dyslexic, it actually helps a lot. I feel if you don’t say anything or keep it hidden, people may say something behind your back, or like, <i>Why did you misspell this, why was it like that?</i> While if you tell them, especially your friends, it’s more acceptable. <i>Yes, he’s struggling with something else that we don’t have. It’s understandable.”</i></p>
			<p class="indent">What are the reactions when students share that they are dyslexic? They mostly reflect ignorance. Some students even assume dyslexic students read backward.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_397" title="397"/>What about when you are going out with someone—do you tell the person you’re dyslexic? Here’s a typical response: “Since I’m confident about it and I don’t make it seem like it’s holding me back in any way, I do tell the person…. I explain the whole story: ‘No, I’m fine, I can read, I’ve gone through training on how to learn my own way,’ and it’s always been fine. This has never been something that has been the downfall of a relationship.” Others feel more like, “If the situation is appropriate, I’ll share my dyslexia. Really, it’s not something that says I’m different or have a terrible problem. It’s who I am.”</p>
			<h3 class="head"><b>FIRST-TIME DIAGNOSIS IN COLLEGE</b></h3>
			<p>Some students in college have never been diagnosed with dyslexia but may indeed be dyslexic. How might you decide if you, or your child, or your student, is dyslexic? As you have read, suspect dyslexia in an intelligent person who since childhood has had spoken-language difficulties, including word retrieval; who learned to read late, reads slowly and with effort, and is a terrible speller; who struggled through foreign-language classes in high school; and who found herself having to work longer hours than peers or not being able to go to after-school or weekend activities in order to keep up with academic demands. In college there are typically four distinct areas that prompt a visit to the resource office:</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Inability to finish tests on time.</i> “I’m incredibly frustrated because I know the material, and yet when it comes to tests, I can’t seem to finish when everyone else hands in their paper. As a result, I am doing very poorly in several courses in which I know the material quite well.”</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>A miserable experience in foreign-language class.</i> Students describe trying very hard in their French class, for example, and just not being able to follow the class. Yet they have classmates who are able to think, speak, and answer questions in French with ease.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Inability to keep up with the demands in some but not all classes.</i> Typically, unidentified dyslexic students find themselves falling behind generally only in courses that have an especially heavy reading load. Comprehending the material is not the problem; being able to complete all the reading is the difficulty.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_398" title="398"/><i>Test at-risk for dyslexia on the Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™, Adolescent-Adult Form.</i> There is now a brief ten-item, evidence-based screener that you complete and immediately lets you know if you are or are not at-risk for dyslexia (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c29_r1.xhtml#page_406">this page</a>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><i>If you are or know a student who is experiencing at least one of these difficulties, or who has been screened as at-risk for dyslexia, a visit to the resource office at the college is in order. Do not wait. With a diagnosis comes self-understanding and help.</i></p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL</b></h2>
			<p>
				Once you are comfortable in college, you begin to think, <i>What’s next?</i> The questions begin to build as your dreams and hopes for the future rise up and your longstanding doubts and fears about your own abilities surface once again. Is pursuing postgraduate study the right choice for you as a person who is dyslexic?</p>
			<p class="indent">First, you should know that the accommodations available to you in college are also available in graduate and professional programs. If you are harboring anxieties about entering the fields of law, medicine, business, or writing, you should be reassured (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c34_r1.xhtml#page_489">this page</a>). I am often asked, “I don’t do well on standardized tests like the GRE. How will this affect my admission?” Here’s how this affected one dyslexic scientist, Carol Greider, Ph.D., winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine and professor and director in molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University: “If UC Berkeley had done the same thing that many of the other schools did, which was to apply a cutoff [on the GRE], then I wouldn’t have gone to graduate school and made the discovery of telomerase and won the Nobel Prize.” Instead UC Berkeley was wise enough to look past her low GRE scores and see the brilliance within her. Dr. Greider did her Nobel Prize–winning research as a graduate student at Berkeley. When successful dyslexic college and professional school graduates share their experiences and strategies for success, their most important conclusion is that you mustn’t underestimate the critical role of perseverance and tenacity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Those two attributes are reflected in the findings from our recent study. In my experience working with admissions officers at various institutions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_399" title="399"/>of higher learning, the major concern expressed about admitting dyslexic students is how they will do. Can dyslexic students manage the workload? Will they be successful following graduation? From interacting with dyslexic students at my own university and from experiences speaking around the country, I knew anecdotally that dyslexic students could and in fact did succeed at rigorous universities. As a scientist, I knew that the only way to prove it was to design a study that would test the hypothesis that dyslexic students could succeed at one of the most rigorous of universities, Yale.</p>
			<p class="indent">The study, <i>The Yale Outcome Study: Outcomes for Graduates With and Without Dyslexia,</i> was straightforward. Focusing on Yale students who had graduated five or more years before, we asked questions about both their Yale experience and their work and life experiences since graduating. Our study sample was equally divided between Yale students who were dyslexic and those who were typical readers. The alums completed a 150-question survey asking about their academic experience at Yale, level of self-esteem at Yale, employment after college, work ethic, and learning style.</p>
			<p class="indent">The only statistically significant difference in the academic experience of the dyslexic and nondyslexic alums was more “time needed to complete schoolwork,” which was reported by more dyslexic respondents. There were no significant differences in “difficulty and enjoyment of classes,” “self-perceived confidence, motivation, and intelligence,” or “academic stress.” Responses to survey questions about participation in college life were reassuring; the dyslexic group indicated that they did not spend any less time on extracurricular activities. Compared to their nondyslexic fellow Yale graduates, the dyslexic alums showed a trend toward higher overall self-esteem when they were in college.</p>
			<p class="indent">The same positive pattern extended into the postgraduate years in responses to questions about their employment and their work ethic and perseverance. Overall, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of income, future outlook, relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction, or confidence in goal achievement.</p>
			<p class="indent">Reading some of the statements of these Yale grads helps to shed light on how these young men and women were able to be so successful or at their perception of it. For example, there was a recurring focus on their strengths:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Dyslexia taught me how to take advantage of what I am good at and learn to manage my weaknesses.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_400" title="400"/>Many came to view dyslexia as responsible for their success:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Because I read slowly, I tend to focus more on what I am reading, and I think that helps me absorb the material better than some. In my work, it is very useful to fully grasp and understand the material I am reading, so in many ways, my slow reading may help my job performance.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Perseverance was noted by almost all the dyslexic respondents. For example:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I don’t give up easily.</p>
				<p class="spaceabove">Dyslexia has helped me in the long run because I’ve always worked harder than my peers.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">A different way of thinking was expressed as well:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>I find I look at the bigger picture and can solve problems.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Finding so few significant differences between dyslexic and nondyslexic Yale alums led us to conclude, <i>“When intellectually gifted students with dyslexia are given academic opportunity at a rigorous institution, they can succeed academically, professionally, and personally.”</i></p>
			<p class="indent">The Yale Outcome Study is the first to examine outcome at an institution of high intellectual rigor and to do so in multiple spheres. These are extremely powerful results, perhaps a “game-changer,” as one of my associates proclaimed. The data are unequivocal: Dyslexic students can succeed if given the opportunity. It is critically important that this information be shared with both high school admissions counselors and college admissions officers. Dyslexic boys and girls and their parents need to know this important and, to some, surprising new information. Yes, a dyslexic student can aim high and succeed. The data clearly show that given intelligence, perseverance, and self-awareness, there is no limit to what a dyslexic can dream of achieving, either in postsecondary education or in the workplace.</p>
