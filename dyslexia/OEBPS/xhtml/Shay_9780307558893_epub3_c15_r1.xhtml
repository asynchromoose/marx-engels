			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>RECOGNIZING DYSLEXIA IN ADULT MIDLIFE WOMEN</b></h1>
			<p>Science has provided new insights suggesting a relationship between dyslexia and certain difficulties experienced by many midlife women. These findings describe how signs of dyslexia may surprise women of a certain age and stage of life, particularly around the menopausal years. Menopause is due to the greatly reduced function of the ovaries, resulting in severely diminishing levels of ovarian hormones, especially estrogen. The time prior to menopause is termed perimenopause, a time of transition when the ovaries gradually make less and less estrogen. This process occurs over time, typically during a decade before menopause, when a woman is in her forties or even late thirties. During the perimenopausal time of life, a woman has greatly reduced estrogen available to her. The average age at menopause is about fifty years and is diagnosed after a woman has not experienced her period for about a year, at which point she enters postmenopause.</p>
			<p class="indent">I want to focus on the relationship between the symptoms of dyslexia and a woman’s estrogen loss beginning with perimenopause and extending to menopause and postmenopause. Let’s start with Louise, who sent this email to me:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					My dyslexia appears to be worsening as I get older. I am approaching menopause and wonder if this has anything to do with what I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_190" title="190"/>am experiencing. All the symptoms I had when younger seem to be increasing at a steady and concerning pace. The word finding is rearing its embarrassing head now more than ever, and it is taking me forever to read, whether it is work-related materials or even the newspaper. I am an attorney and you can imagine how troublesome and yes, even frightening this is to me.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Louise’s concern is typical of many women throughout the stages of menopause who worry that they are having increasing trouble retrieving words. These worries often occur in highly successful women in their fifth to sixth decades of life; that is, they are entering or are in menopause. The symptoms of dyslexia may appear to be less prominent during middle adulthood. However, as these women mature, they often feel that their symptoms are becoming more prominent and troublesome. They worry that they are losing their intelligence or have the first signs of Alzheimer’s. As I speak to these women, I am no longer surprised when I hear in a hushed semiwhisper, “I haven’t told many people this, but I am also dyslexic.” A distinguished colleague of mine complained of word-retrieval problems like Louise’s: “It was on the tip of my tongue, but I just couldn’t get the right words out.” We spoke, and I asked if she had ever been diagnosed with dyslexia. “Oh yes, when I was in school,” she replied. Soon afterward we were both attending the same lecture at a conference when she raised her hand to make a comment and couldn’t find the words. She looked back at me in the audience and winked as she mouthed, “Yup, now I know, this is my dyslexia showing again.” Afterward she shared with me how reassuring our conversation had been: Otherwise she would have been terrified when she could not get the words out during the lecture.</p>
			<p class="indent">These women may or may not be surprised to learn that there may be a strong connection not only between their word-retrieval difficulties and their dyslexia but also between female hormones and reading and speaking.</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BRAIN FOR LANGUAGE</b></h2>
			<p>
				For decades dyslexia was thought to affect only males. As a consequence, only boys and men were invited to participate in research studies on dyslexia, and psychologists and educators tended to identify only males as having <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191" title="191"/>dyslexia. When we began our brain imaging studies of dyslexia, I insisted that women as well as men be included. As I said earlier, our first study was to use functional imaging to map out the language areas in the brain, and we discovered significant differences in the brain activation patterns of the women compared to the men. To remind you, women activated both left and right sides of their brains while men activated primarily the left hemisphere (see Figure 20, <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page_73">this page</a>). These findings spawned an international discussion of sex differences affecting cognition and language, including a series of cartoons (see figures 39 and 40).</p>
			<p class="indent">What did these findings tell us? I began to delve into the subject, especially after I was appointed to serve on the National Research Council Committee on Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter? For this committee I was responsible for writing about how a person’s sex affects his or her cognitive function. I reviewed the cognitive areas in which males and females differed and looked at the list of functions in which women’s performance exceeded that of men, particularly in the verbal domain. As I read through each of the functions, I was struck by how many of the functions that favored women were the very same functions strongly influencing reading and often reflecting phonological processing. Specifically, women show an advantage in verbal fluency, speech production, ability to decode a language, spelling, and articulatory skills.</p>

			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-112"/>As noted in the report, “the term verbal abilities is not a unitary concept,” which means that sex differences do occur but not for every verbal function. Indeed, women do not generally excel over men in other areas of verbal function, such as comprehension and vocabulary. It’s interesting that these two areas of verbal function are precisely those that typically are <i>not</i> affected by dyslexia. These and similar findings led me to postulate that the female sex hormone, estrogen, may have an impact on phonological function and, with it, reading and speaking.</p>
			<p class="indent">To further understand the relationship of estrogen, cognitive function, and phonologically related skills, we designed the first studies to examine the potential impact of estrogen on reading-related skills. <span id="ftn-113"/>The initial study was a functional brain imaging (fMRI) experiment in which we examined the effects of estrogen on neural systems in the brain in postmenopausal women. We observed that the inferior parietal lobule, a brain region specifically activated by phonologic tasks, shows increased activation in postmenopausal women taking estrogen. This study led us to hypothesize that, through its actions on phonologic processing, estrogen would exert a positive influence on reading in postmenopausal women. It also suggests that in women like Louise, the reemergence of dyslexia symptoms during menopause may be related to their diminished estrogen levels.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193" title="193"/><span id="ftn-114"/>In our next study, a state-of-the-art randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT, the gold standard in treatment studies), we found that, as we reported in the journal <i>Menopause,</i> in postmenopausal women <i>estrogen treatment was associated with significantly better performance on oral reading and verbal memory.</i> These findings should encourage those physicians caring for women in the menopausal years to take seriously concerns about difficulties in reading, speaking, and memory experienced by those women and to understand that these problems have a biologic component and that there is a possible effective treatment: estrogen.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> It is important to point out that while estrogen may be helpful to dyslexic women when they are at or approaching menopause, it also may have serious consequences for certain groups of women. As with any medication, you must first check with your physician.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">If you are a woman approaching menopause and find yourself misspeaking or unable to utter the word you intend to say, experiencing reading difficulty—especially finding reading effortful and slow—and/or suddenly making spelling errors, think about dyslexia as a possible cause. Louise, who had been diagnosed as dyslexic, recognized these symptoms for what they were. There are many women who experience these symptoms who have never been diagnosed as dyslexic and worry about what they may imply. Never having been diagnosed as dyslexic does not mean you are not dyslexic. As we’ve seen, schools have not always done very well in identifying dyslexia in children. If these symptoms keep recurring, whatever your age, seek out an evaluation. There are highly effective steps we can take to teach reading at any age. It is to that subject I now turn.</p>
