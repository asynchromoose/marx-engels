			<h1 class="chap_title"><b>DIAGNOSING BRIGHT YOUNG ADULTS</b></h1>
			<p>Almost three decades ago I received a call from the dean of undergraduate studies at Yale University. He wondered if I could help him with an unusual request from Kayla, an undergraduate about to enter her senior year, who wanted to do what was unheard of at Yale at that time: spend an extra, ninth semester at Yale. She said she was dyslexic and required the extra semester. The dean was astonished: “I’ve reviewed her records and she is absolutely brilliant!” Having had little experience with dyslexic young adults, I, too, was puzzled. So I started where every diagnostic journey must begin: with the history. This was my introduction to the world of bright young adults with dyslexia.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kayla struggled early on and since age eight had attended specialized schools where she was able to receive close attention and specific help for her dyslexia. An evaluation from third grade seemed to reflect the comments of many of her teachers: “Her oral reading is characterized by frequent hesitations, pauses, and repetitions. Although she is working very hard to master reading subskills, she is not yet successful in using them to figure out unfamiliar words. Comprehension, however, is quite good.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The indicators were clear. I knew Kayla was dyslexic. I was impressed that a dyslexic could be successful in a college where there was such a heavy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176" title="176"/>demand for reading, and I wondered how many students like Kayla attended top-flight colleges. Although Kayla’s standardized test scores were not stratospheric, her qualities as “a creative thinker, an inquisitive scholar, and an independent leader,” as cited by one of her high school teachers, must have caught the eye of an admissions staffer.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kayla explained that she had completed her first three years “at a great cost.” Reading very slowly and with great effort, she had devoted all her time and energy just to keeping up. Now that she was approaching her senior year, she did not want to see the quality of her education diminished because of lack of time:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>Though my grades in [my] courses are not bad, I feel that to the degree to which grades can reflect any truth at all, they reflect a level of mediocrity inappropriate to my intellectual aptitude, earnest scholarship and industriousness…. I am requesting a ninth term of study in which to complete these courses in a manner befitting my intellectual aptitude and earnest studentship…. The point is not that I am almost inarticulate, nor that I can barely struggle through a page of text…. I want the stuff of a liberal education, for whatever it’s worth, to carry with me in my life. I want to possess, to understand, to challenge and to recreate the ideas, knowledge and visions of the liberal tradition.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Kayla was given permission to extend her studies for one semester and graduated from Yale the following year. She is now an accomplished screenwriter with an impressive record of television and movie credits.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although no one is ever cured of dyslexia, highly intelligent, exceptionally hardworking, and strongly motivated young men and women with dyslexia can attend rigorous colleges and successfully complete their education, as hundreds have at Yale, Brown, Harvard, Stanford, Washington University, Duke, the University of Pennsylvania, Williams, Amherst, Middlebury, and other excellent colleges and professional schools. I know that at Yale our dyslexic students have performed well, reflecting the full range of abilities and personalities of all our students. Admissions officers are clearly attuned to the competencies of these students; they appreciate that the qualities they are looking for go far beyond what test scores have to say about a person. The University of Chicago is, too, having announced in June 2018 that standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT are now <i>optional</i> rather than required for admission.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_177" title="177"/>From my thirty years of working directly with dyslexic students at Yale and other universities, and from my research and that of others, the sea of strengths interspersed with isolated islands of weakness model has held up. In particular, the students at Yale have shown me what it means to be bright and dyslexic. I consult about issues relating to dyslexia in students and faculty at Yale, and in the process I read through their records—essentially mini-biographies. As I peruse these documents, I read of little boys and girls who struggled to read or couldn’t quite form their letters or print their names neatly, who could not spell, who stuttered and stammered as they mispronounced words, who puzzled their teachers and parents, and who were poked and prodded to try to understand why. I think of their mothers and fathers and all that they and their children endured. I cannot help but think of the worries each parent must have had. Reading one report after another, I imagine how much parents (and children, too) must have worried and how gratifying it must be to see their dyslexic child now as a successful student at such a high level.</p>
			<p class="indent">I have come to know dozens and dozens of brilliant, extraordinary students and faculty at all levels, met with them, talked with them, problem-solved with them, and in great detail have reviewed their testing records. I have learned that at the level of college and beyond, standardized and other tests tell us very little of a dyslexic individual’s potential for academic success and for future contributions to society.</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> Be aware that many tests that are labeled as “cognitive” measures may not be fully tapping into and measuring some of the essential qualities that converge to bring about brilliance, creativity, or perseverance.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">In a dyslexic student, so-called average scores on reading tests cannot measure the extraordinary effort that went into reading each word, to laboriously pronouncing it syllable by syllable, to rereading it over and over again until it began to sound right and make sense. What a juxtaposition: the tremendous cognitive strengths and conceptual ability of the bright dyslexic young adult on one level, and on another her ongoing struggle, at the most basic level of language, to try to decode and identify the printed word. Here she is, all geared up, her powerful intellectual equipment waiting to be fed its nourishment of words so that she can assimilate and feast on the ideas and the thoughts they contain, but to get to the basic substrate, the printed word, she must first decode and identify that word. What a frustration. What perseverance. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178" title="178"/>A new study, the Yale Outcome Study (see <a href="Shay_9780307558893_epub3_c28_r1.xhtml#page_399">this page</a>), which I will share with you later, presents heartening and reassuring data about what happens when bright, hardworking, persevering dyslexic students meet up with an enlightened university.</p>
			<p class="indent">For students attending competitive colleges or enrolled in graduate degree programs or professional schools, the texture of their lives and their accomplishments will tell us more than their performance on timed tests. If a student is thriving at a highly competitive college, am I to believe that a timed test is a better measure of her potential for learning than her insightful comments and thoughtful responses in the classroom, her ability to appreciate the big picture and get the gist or main point of what she has read or heard in a class discussion, or her compelling essays or performance on untimed exams? <span id="ftn-107"/>As comedian Richard Pryor said, “Who are you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes?”</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>DIAGNOSIS</b></h2>
			<p><span id="ftn-108"/>In 1996, in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the first description of developmental dyslexia, I was invited to write an article for <i>Scientific American,</i> “Dyslexia,” in which I discuss Gregory, the medical student whom we met earlier, who typifies many bright young adults with dyslexia. He was extremely bright, understood the most difficult concepts, and yet had trouble pronouncing anatomical names and memorizing isolated facts. Following the publication of that article, I received many letters and emails from students and parents of students. Some of the students had already been diagnosed as dyslexic, while a substantial minority had never been evaluated for dyslexia. For example, Brandon Rogers, a philosophy major in a liberal arts college in the Midwest, wrote:</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p>
					I have always done well in school…. If I didn’t get something, I would study it and study it until I did. I would revise papers over and over again until they were pretty much perfect. If it meant staying up much (or even most) of the night, I would put in whatever work was necessary to do well. Until recently, I never thought anything of this. I figured that the problems I had learning that made me have to put in so much overtime were the same problems everyone had. No one ever thought I might have a learning <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179" title="179"/>disability, much less dyslexia. I always did well in school. I was the smart one. I got A’s. Therefore, why bother testing me for something I clearly didn’t have?…When I first heard about dyslexia, it was one of those meaningless terms thrown around, and seen as an excuse for people who don’t like to work hard. But the more I have learned about it, the more I feel it might be affecting me. The pronunciation problems I have, the insane spelling errors, the abysmally slow pace of my reading, the needing to read things over and over again, the problems getting down what the professor says—I thought that maybe I had figured out what has been causing some of the issues I’ve always had. I just want to know for sure.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">Brandon’s questions echo those I hear from many college students and other young adults concerned about their reading. Yes, it is both possible and, I think, worthwhile to obtain a specific diagnosis of your reading difficulties. No, Brandon’s constellation of problems is not normal, but it is exactly what we would expect to see in a bright young man or woman who is dyslexic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Following scores of dyslexic children as they matured into young adults has given us a picture of the evolution of dyslexia over time. This clinical information is now enhanced by research studies of reading in adults (both dyslexic and typical readers) and by real-time studies of brain function during reading. These research findings have important implications for the diagnosis of dyslexia in young adults.</p>
			<p class="indent">As children mature, bones elongate, muscles strengthen, voices deepen, fingers grow steadier, strides lengthen, knowledge accumulates, and skills sharpen. Yet the core phonologic deficit in dyslexia remains, even in the brightest and hardest-working children. <span id="ftn-109"/>Numerous studies conducted on college students and other adults document the persistence of the phonologic deficit.</p>
			<p class="indent">The implication of all this for the diagnosis of dyslexia in adults is that, as Johns Hopkins researcher Maggie Bruck noted, phonologic deficits are constant through the lives of men and women who are dyslexic. This means that data gathered from a dyslexic as a child that demonstrate phonologic difficulties will align with data from his or her adult life that continue to give indications of problems in phonologic processing. Phonologic deficits persist—even though they may improve a bit—in virtually all those diagnosed as dyslexic in childhood. Of course, dyslexic readers can learn to read <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_180" title="180"/>more words accurately and typically read with good comprehension. But the persistent phonologic deficit prevents fluency. Difficulties during childhood evolve into slow, labored reading in adulthood. Thankfully, it is our cognitive capability and not our phonology that allows us, as humans, to reason, to analyze, and to solve problems at the very highest levels—and to be capable of great accomplishment.</p>
			<p class="indent">Researchers discovered that dyslexic college students take a very long time to identify words, even words they can eventually identify correctly. If dyslexic readers attempt to (or are made to) read too quickly, they simply will not be able to identify words accurately. This may be misinterpreted as a lack of understanding. Just how much of an issue speed is for dyslexic adults was demonstrated in what is referred to by researchers as a reading match study. College students with histories of dyslexia were compared to sixth-grade children reading at the same level of accuracy. <i>The dyslexic college students were the slower readers.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">In order to understand how college-age dyslexics read, we must separate the number of words a person can read from the <i>manner</i> in which he goes about reading those words. Two college students, one dyslexic and the other a typical reader, may read the same word accurately but via two entirely different neural routes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Earlier I talked about evidence from brain research that offers tantalizing clues to how dyslexic and typically reading adults diverge in their reading pathways. Recall that in skilled readers, the fast-paced occipito-temporal system automatically recognizes a word, bringing together the core components (the phonology, the orthography, and the semantics), and the word is read rapidly and effortlessly. In a dyslexic reader, an inefficient occipito-temporal system prevents automatic reading. Instead he is dependent on secondary reading pathways, often those in the front and right side of the brain. Dependence on these secondary routes to reading has important implications for how he reads. First they allow him to read a large number of words, albeit very slowly. Second, rather than the sound-based route to reading, the dyslexic reader relies on her higher cognitive abilities to infer the meaning of the unknown word from the surrounding context. This is why the bright dyslexic reader does so much better in reading words in context compared to words in isolation or with scanty contexts.</p>
			<p class="indent">Slow reading is the price the dyslexic pays for this more indirect route to getting to the meaning of an unknown word. At the same time, dyslexic young adults, with much perseverance and sufficient time, are well able to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181" title="181"/>comprehend college-level materials. <span id="ftn-110"/>Studies have confirmed the universal nature of this faulty wiring; dyslexic students worldwide, speaking different languages, share a disruption of the primary neural systems for reading.</p>
			<p class="indent">Understanding that the dyslexic reader relies on neural systems that permit accurate but not fluent reading helps explain why the kinds of tests and approaches used for diagnosing dyslexia in young children may not be suitable or sufficient for older children and young adults. Scores on traditional (untimed) tests of word recognition may not differentiate accomplished young adults with dyslexia from peers of a similar age who are good readers. Tests of reading fluency, which are often timed, are more valid measures of dyslexia in these young adults.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is vital that scientific data is translated into everyday clinical practice so that decisions made about dyslexic young men and women are based on science and not on misconceptions or outmoded views. The latest scientific data provide strong validation of the unexpected nature of the reading difficulty in bright young adults who are dyslexic. Such individuals may score very high on a test of intelligence, especially on verbal reasoning components, and, in contrast to typical readers, for whom intelligence and reading are tightly linked, score quite poorly (much lower) on a test of reading, especially reading fluency. Tests of intelligence, happily, provide tangible evidence to the individual that he or she is intelligent. The difference this knowledge makes for that individual is incredibly powerful.</p>
			<p class="indent">For the most part, though, the heart of a diagnosis of dyslexia in a bright young adult lies in her history. At this stage of life, dyslexic readers have accumulated enough life experiences to document a trail of phonologic-based reading difficulties. For some, like Kayla, it is a history of reading difficulties leading to evaluation, tutoring, or special schooling. For others, like Brandon, often because they are so bright, the diagnosis of dyslexia is delayed, and symptoms are brushed aside with the explanation, “Oh, but he’s smart. Let’s wait.” This is the kind of child who falls between the cracks and escapes diagnosis until he is an adult.</p>
			<p class="indent">I remember Aaron’s mother’s frustration as she told me how she knew that there was a problem when she noticed Aaron’s agonizingly slow reading and abysmal spelling and how he would do his homework well into the night. She recalls how she worried about his bar mitzvah preparation, only to be told by his secular and religious instructors virtually the same things: not to worry, Aaron was so very, very intelligent that it would come. When she shared her concerns with his Hebrew tutor, he, too, was dismissive, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182" title="182"/>again noting Aaron’s superior intellect. However, after several lessons, the tutor sheepishly contacted Aaron’s parents and agreed that despite his high intelligence, the boy had some serious reading issues, along with significant difficulties learning a second language, Hebrew. Aaron was finally diagnosed as dyslexic many years after he had endured painful frustration, anxiety, and self-doubt. (I would be remiss if I didn’t mention, too, the very many bar and bat mitzvahs of dyslexic boys and girls I have attended, where, with appropriate support and tutoring, the children shone on their special day.)</p>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> A child’s high thinking and reasoning ability can work against him. As I have said, in dyslexia, intelligence and reading are not related. Do not allow a child’s high intelligence to be used to delay diagnosis, help, and self-understanding.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="indent">We look for a pattern of findings pointing to a phonologic deficit permeating almost every aspect of a young adult’s life. Each case will differ as to the specific ingredients of that pattern; <i>there is no single event, symptom, or test score that in itself is diagnostic.</i> The phonologic weakness is virtually always present, but we must know how to recognize it in different settings and during different life stages. A developmental history of difficulties with language, particularly phonologically based components of language, often provides the clearest and most reliable indication of a reading disorder. Slow reading is the primary symptom of dyslexia in an accomplished young adult. As I just explained, in these bright individuals, standard assessment procedures used in children may be inadequate and often misleading. So for now, the history of word-retrieval difficulties, laborious reading and writing, poor spelling, and requiring additional time in reading and in taking tests often represents the most sensitive and accurate indicator of dyslexia in young adults. The diagnosis of dyslexia at any age is not about formulas or magical cutoff scores; it is about understanding how a phonologic deficit affects people’s lives. Theory provides the template, but true understanding comes from developing an intimate sense of the disorder as it is expressed day in and day out over a span of years, and even decades.</p>
			<p class="indent">Our approach to the diagnosis in young adults comes naturally from all that we have learned about reading and the brain. Above all, it calls upon clinical judgment. It is a thinking man’s (or woman’s) approach, not based on unproven formulas or arbitrary decisions. Rather, cutting-edge science and good old-fashioned common sense drive the process. If one understands <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_183" title="183"/>the basic nature of dyslexia, the diagnosis unfolds easily and naturally. It is critical therefore for evaluators to understand dyslexia fully so that they can function as <i>diagnosticians</i> rather than as rigid adherents to unproven theories.</p>
			<p class="indent">Young men and women who are dyslexic may manifest what seems to be a confusing array of contradictory findings—honors and failures, commendations and warnings, the ninety-ninth percentile in some areas and the ninth percentile in others, brilliant thinker and hopelessly slow reader—all in the same person. Dyslexic readers experience awesome highs and devastating lows. One day they are praised for incisive thinking, so that they feel they must be very smart, and the next day a disappointing performance on a timed multiple-choice test makes them feel “really dumb” and leads them to wonder how they “could have fooled so many people for so long.”</p>
			<h2 class="head"><b>MAX’S STORY: IN SCHOOL, AND NOW IN THE REAL WORLD</b></h2>
			<p>For all those who continue to feel very nervous if called on to read and who to this day, as an adult, “can still hear my classmates’ laughter and hurtful remarks,” please know that there can be a happy ending, which is why I want to share Max’s story with you. I met Max when we were both invited to speak at the September 18, 2014, congressional Committee on Science, Space and Technology hearing on “The Science of Dyslexia.” Max gave testimony on the personal impact of having dyslexia. We went to dinner the evening before the hearing and Max shared many of his experiences growing up. He described having to read aloud a passage about John F. Kennedy to the class, recalling how he stuttered and stumbled while the whole class laughed at him. The experience was devastating, so that “it pretty much killed reading from a prepared text for the rest of my life.” Sure enough, decades later, when testifying before Congress, Max began by stating, “I was asked here to talk about what it was like being dyslexic. I will say for me, first of all, let’s just say that I didn’t prepare a statement because the last time I tried to read aloud from a prepared statement, my whole fifth-grade class laughed at me…. So I am just going to be brief and speak from the heart.”</p>
			<p class="indent">And he did. Max is Max Brooks, the best-selling author of <i>The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead</i> and <i>World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,</i> which was made into a motion picture with Brad Pitt. Most recently, Max wrote a novel called <i>Minecraft: The Island.</i> His books have sold millions of copies, and he is besieged by autograph seekers.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_184" title="184"/>Thinking of so many of the dyslexic young men and women I have come to know, including Kayla and Brandon, I asked Max, “When you were a little boy, did you ever dream of hordes of people, even one person, wanting your autograph?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Never, never, never, never, never. I never thought I would be successful at anything. That’s how low my self-esteem was.”</p>
			<p class="indent">When you feel you are up against a brick wall or unable to read aloud without hearing snickering from your classmates, please keep in mind the arc of Max’s life—rising from shame, anxiety, and low self-esteem to a successful and happy adult life.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="transition">—</div>
			<p>Science and common sense say that if a person reads extremely slowly and yet is able to comprehend materials at a college level or beyond, he most likely has a phonologic deficit as well as significant strengths. Together, this strongly suggests he is dyslexic. In my experience, the diagnosis becomes straightforward once the diagnostician understands the basic nature of dyslexia. This knowledge can now be applied to the three-step process we established earlier for the diagnosis of dyslexia in young children.</p>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Step 1. Establish a reading problem according to age, education, or intelligence.</i> A major step in establishing a reading problem in an accomplished adult comes from information gathered from a careful history. The most consistent and telling sign is slow and laborious reading and writing. The failure to recognize or to measure the lack of fluency in reading is probably the most common error in the diagnosis of dyslexia in bright young adults.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Keep in mind that a simple word-identification task often will not identify dyslexia in someone accomplished enough to graduate from college and attend law, medical, business, or any other graduate school. A dyslexic young adult may score well reading real words in an untimed setting, reflecting that she may previously have come across those words in her readings and committed the words to memory. When she sees one of those words on a word-identification task, she retrieves the stored word from memory and identifies it without having ever learned to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_185" title="185"/>decode it. So a dyslexic young adult’s score when asked to read a list of real words may be deceptively high. Tests relying solely on the accuracy of word identification may therefore be inadequate for diagnosing dyslexia in these individuals.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">Tests of reading single nonsense words (word attack) are more helpful, because to be read, these words <i>must</i> be decoded. Since they are made-up words, they could not have been previously encountered, stored, and then retrieved from memory.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span>To establish lack of fluency in accomplished adults, someone can read timed paragraphs and respond to questions on tests such as the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (NDRT, for ages fourteen to sixty-five years), or read timed connected texts aloud and answer questions based on the text on tests such as the Gray Oral Reading Test, fifth edition (GORT-5, for ages six to twenty-three years, eleven months).</p>
			</div>
			<blockquote class="offset">
				<p><i>CAUTION:</i> An article that appeared in the <i>Journal of Learning Disabilities</i> in 2013 reported that reading comprehension test items on the NDRT can be answered correctly <i>without reading the associated passage</i>. Strange as it seems, test-takers were asked to respond to questions based on paragraphs they had never read. Results indicated that higher IQ, verbal comprehension, and broad reading skills were significantly associated with higher NDRT passageless scores; based on the question itself, test-takers were able to make reasonable guesses of the multiple-choice answers. This finding resonates with my and others’ experience with bright young adults who lack fluency and must read with great effort and then go on to score high on the NDRT comprehension test (both time-limited and with additional time). It is often the very brightest and least fluent young man or woman who obtains such a score.</p>
				<p class="indent">This is important to a young adult seeking a diagnosis of dyslexia, because it means that a person can score high on the comprehension components of the NDRT without ever reading the paragraphs. Seeing this score, an examiner may <i>incorrectly</i> conclude <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_186" title="186"/>that the individual, scoring high on a timed reading comprehension measure, is not in need of extra time. The brighter you are, the more likely it is that you will be able to score well on the NDRT, even without ever having read the passage. A person can score high on the <i>timed</i> comprehension component of the NDRT and still require extra time on tests.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<div class="custom_list block">
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Step 2. Gather evidence supporting dyslexia’s unexpectedness.</i> High learning capability may be directly determined by administering a test of intelligence, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS, ages sixteen to ninety) or, for those a bit younger, the WISC-V (ages six to sixteen years, eleven months). Alternatively, or in addition, high learning capability may be inferred on the basis of an educational or professional level of attainment. An accomplished adult’s educational level or professional status provides a very good indication of learning capability. Graduation from a competitive college or status as a graduate, medical, business, or law student indicates high capability.</p>
				<p class="list0_indent">A lack of fluency (slow reading) in such an adult signifies an <i>unexpected</i> reading problem or dyslexia. Any scores obtained on testing must be considered relative to those of peers with the same degree of education or professional training. I prefer that the individual also be given an IQ test, such as the WAIS. As I’ve said, viewing their objective scores on the WAIS allows individuals to see how intelligent they truly are.</p>
				<p class="list0"><span class="list_ornament"><span class="figure_inline"><img alt="" class="isqueeze1_1" role="presentation" src="../images/Shay_9780679781592_all_1p_r4_Page_028_Image_0001.jpg"/></span> </span><i>Step 3. Demonstrate evidence of an isolated phonologic weakness, with higher-level language functions such as vocabulary and comprehension relatively unaffected.</i> An ongoing pattern of slow reading, word-retrieval difficulties, poor spelling, and difficulties in learning a second language in the face of high levels of educational or professional achievement provides evidence of an encapsulated phonologic weakness. Similarly, strong conceptual and reasoning abilities on the WAIS, or strengths in reading comprehension or other nonphonologically-based domains, such as higher-level math, indicate a sea of strengths.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187" title="187"/>Following these three basic steps and applying knowledge of the developmental pattern of reading and dyslexia results in a precise and scientifically valid diagnosis of dyslexia in an accomplished young adult or adult. If a person is dyslexic, he is dyslexic for life. There is no rational reason for college students to be retested if they have been evaluated and diagnosed in adolescence or later, unless there has been an extraordinary change in their symptoms or life circumstances. Retesting may actually be harmful, placing unnecessary psychological and financial burdens on an already overwhelmed dyslexic student.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="ftn-111"/>This was legally affirmed in a 2014 settlement between the Department of Justice and the Law School Admission Council (LSAC). If a person has received accommodations on a high-stakes standardized test and is now requesting similar accommodations on a Law School Admission Test (LSAT), that individual should receive these accommodations without reassessment. In 1997, in a case brought by students with learning disabilities at Boston University, the judge ruled that there was no basis for requiring retesting of college students every three years, noting that “defendants have produced no peer-reviewed literature or scientific testimony that provides evidence for the idea that a person’s learning disability will show any change after adulthood, or that a student’s test scores will show substantial change during their college career.” This legal opinion reflects scientific fact.</p>
			<p class="indent">The often-repeated notion that some students <i>pretend</i> to be dyslexic is utter nonsense. In my experience with now literally hundreds of students, I have yet to encounter a young man or woman who falsely claimed to be dyslexic. For those who understand dyslexia and its tremendous costs to the individual, the very idea that someone would willingly seek such a diagnosis is absurd. As Sally Esposito, a former coordinator of disability services at Yale, explains, “The students just don’t want to identify themselves. They don’t want to be labeled. I guess they simply don’t want to be viewed as different or disabled. They are so embarrassed by the stigma. They panic when they think their professors or classmates will find out. One of my biggest problems is getting students to identify themselves and come to the office for the services that they are entitled to. Often they just won’t do it. They say the cost is just too high.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Similarly, I frequently hear that the diagnosis of dyslexia is somehow vague or lacking precision. That, too, is simply untrue. Each time I take my turn as attending physician on our acute in-patient pediatric wards, I am humbled by the often unavoidable lack of precision—even in this day <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_188" title="188"/>of molecular medicine—in making even the seemingly simplest and most common diagnoses. What many do not appreciate is the huge variability inherent in human biology.
