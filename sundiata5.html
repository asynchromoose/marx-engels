<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Mother of the king,' rejoined Sournosso Konkornba, 'life hangs by nothing but a very fine thread, but all is interwoven here , below. Life has a cause, and death as well. The one comes from the other. Your hate has a cause and your action must have a cause. Mother of the king, everything holds together, our action will have no effect unless we are ourselves implicated, but Mari Djata has done us no wrong. It is, then, difficult for us to compass his death.' 'But you are also concerned,' replied the queen mother, 'for the son of Sogolon will be a scourge to us all.' 'The snake seldom bites the foot that does not walk,' said one of the witches. 'Yes, but there are snakes that attack everybody. Allow Sundiata to grow up and we will all repent of it. Tomorrow go to Sogolon's vegetable patch and make a show of picking a few gnougou leaves. Mari Djata stands guard there and you will see how vicious the boy is. He won't have any respect for your age, he'll give you a good thrashing.' 'That's a clever idea,' said one of the .old hags. 'But the cause of our discomfiture will be ourselves, for having touched something which did not belong to us.' / 'We could repeat the offence,' said another, 'and then if he beats us again we would be able to reproach him with being unkind, heartless. In that case we would be concerned, I think.' 'The idea is ingenious,' said Soumosso Konkomba. 'Tomorrow we shall go to Sogolon's vegetable patch.' 'Now there's a happy thought,' concluded the queen mother, laughing for joy. 'Go to the vegetable patch tomorrow and you will see that Sogolon's son is mean. Beforehand, present your.selves at the royal granaries where you will receive the grain I promised you; the cows and calves are already yours.' The old hags bowed and disappeared into the black night. The queen mother was now alone and gloated over her anticipated victory. But her daughter, Nana Triban, woke up. 'Mother, who were you talking to? I thought I heard voices.' 'Sleep, my daughter, it is nothing. You didn't hear any.thing.' In the morning, as usual, Sundiata got his companions to.gether in front _of his mother's hut and said, 'What animal are we going to hunt today?' Kamandjan said, 'I wouldn't mind if we attacked some ele. phants right now.' 'Yes, I am of this opinion too,' said Fran Kamara. 'That will allow us to go far into the bush.' And the young band left after Sogolon had filled the hunting bags with eatables. Sundiata and his companions came back late to the village, but first Djata wanted to take a look at his mother's vegetable patch as was his custom. It was dusk. There he found the nine witches stealing gnougou leaves. They made a show of running away like thieves caught red-handed. 'Stop, stop, poor old women,' said Sundiata, 'what is the matter with you to run away like this. This garden belongs to all.' Straight away his companions and he filled the gourds of the old hags with leaves, aubergines and onions. 'Each time that you run short of condiments come to_ stoc~ up here without fear.' 'You disarm us,' said one of the old crones, and another added, 'And you confound us with your bounty.' 'Listen, Djata,' said Soumosso Konkomba, 'we had come here to test you. We have no need of condiments but your generosity disarms us. We were sent here by the queen mother to provoke you and draw the anger of the nocturnal powers upon you. But nothing can be done against a heart full of kindness. And to think that we have already drawn a hundred measures of rice and a hundred measures of millet 33 -and the queen promises us each a cow and her calf in addition. Forgive us, son of Sogolon.' 'I bear you no ill-will,' said Djata. 'Here, I am returning from the hunt with my companions and we have killed ten elephants, so I will give you an elephant each and there you have some meat!' 'Thank you, son of Sogolon.' 'Thank you, child of Justice.' 'Henceforth,' concluded Soumosso Konkomba, 'we will watch over you.' And the nine witches disappeared into the night. Sundiata and his companions continued on their way to Niani and got back after dark. 1You were really frightened; those nine witches really scared you, eh?' said Sogolon Kolonkan, Djata's young sister. 'How do you know,' retorted, Sundiata, astonished. 'I saw them at night hatching their scheme, but I knew there ¥ was no danger for you.' Kolonkan was well versed in the art of witchcraft and watched over her brother without his suspecting it. Exile But Sogolon was a wise mother. She knew everything that Sassouma could do to hurt her family, and so, one evening, after the children had eaten, she called them together and said to Sundiata. 'Let us leave here, my son; Mantling Bory and Djamarou are vulnerable. They are not yet initiated into the secrets of night, they are not sorcerers. Despairing of ever injuring you, Sassouma will aim her blows at your brother or sister. Let us go away from here. You will return to reign when you are a man for it is in Mali that your destiny must be fulfilled.' ' It was the wisest course. Mantling Bory, the son of Nare Maghan's third wife, Namandje, had no gift of sorcery. Sundiata loved him very much and since the death of Namandje he had been welcomed by Sogolon. Sundiata had found a great friend in his half-brother. You cannot choose your relatives but you can choose your friends. Mantling Bory and Sundiata were real friends and it was to save his brother that Djata accepted exile. Balla Fasseke, Djata's griot, prepared the departure in detail. But Sassouma Berete kept her eye on Sogolon and her family. One morning the king, Dankaran Touman, called the council together. He announced his intention of sending an embassy to the powerful king of Sosso, Soumaoro Kante. For such a delicate m!ssion he had thought of Balla Fasseke, son of Doua, his father's gnot. The council approved the royal decision, the embassy was formed and Balla Fasseke was at the head of it. It was a very clever way of taking away from Sundiata the griot his father had given him. Djata was out hunting and when he came back in the evening, Sogolon Kedjou told him the news. The -embassy had left that very morning. Sundiata flew into a frightful rage. 'What! take away the griot my father gave me! No, he will give me back my griot.' 'Stop!' said Sogolon. 'Let it go. It is Sassouma who is acting \ thus, but she does not know that she obeys a higher order.' 'Come with _me,' said Sundiata to his brother Mantling Bory, and the two prmces went out. Djata bundled aside the guards on the house of Dankaran Touman, but he was so angry that he could not utter a word. It was Mantling Bory who spoke. '~roth~r Dankaran Touman, you have taken away our part of the mhentance. Every prince has had his griot, and you have taken . away B~lla Fasseke. He was not yours but wherever he may be, Balla will always be Djata's griot. And since you do not want to have us around you we shall leave Mali and go far away from here.' 'But I will return,' added the son of Sogolon, vehemently. 'I will return, do you hear?' 'You know that you are going away but you do not know if you will come back,' the king replied. á 'I will return, do you hear me?' Djata went on and his tone was categorical. A shiver ran through the king's whole body. Dankaran Touman trembled in every limb. The two princes went out. The queen mother hurried in and found-her son in a state of collapse. 'Mother, he is leaving but he says he will return. But why is he leaving? I intend to give him back his griot, for my part. Why is he leaving?' , 'Of course, he will stay b0hind since you so desire it, but in that case you might as well give up your throne to him, you who tremble before the threats of a ten-year-old child. Give your seat up to him since you cannot rule. As for me, I am going to return to my parents' village for I áwill not be able to live under the tyranny of Sogolon's son. I will go and finish my days among my kinsfolk and I will say that I had a son who was afraid to rule.' Sassouma bewailed her Jot so much that Dankaran Touman suddenly revealed himself as a man of iron. Now he desired the death of his brothers-but he let them leave, it could not be helped, but if they should ever cross his path again--! He would reign, alone, for power could not be shared! ¥ ,áI Thus Sogolon and her children tasted exile. We poor creatures! We think we are hurting our neighbour at the time when we J are working in the very direction of destiny. Our action is not us for it is commanded of us. Sassouma Berete thought herself victorious because Sogolon and her children had fled from Mali. Their feet ploughed up the dust of the roads. They suffered the insults which those who leave their country know of. Doors were shut against them and kings chased them from their courts. But all that was part of the great destiny of Sundiata. Seven years passed, seven winters followed one another and forgetfulness crept into the souls of men, but time marched on at an even pace. Moons succeeded moons in the same sky and rivers in their beds continued their endless course. Seven years passed and Sundiata grew up. His body became sturdy and his misfortunes made his mind wise. He became a i:nan. Sogolon felt the weight of her years and of the growing hump on her back, while Djata, like a young tree, was shooting up to the sky. After leaving Niani, Sogolon and her children had sojourned at 28 Djedeba with the king, Mansa Konkon, the great sorcerer. Djedeba was a town on the Niger two days away from Niani. The king received them with a little mistrust, but everywhere the stranger enjoys the right to hospitality, so Sogolon and her chil.dren were lodged in the very enclosure of the king and for two months Sundiata and Mantling Bory joined in the games of the king's children. One night, as the children were playing at knuckle-bones outside the palace in the moonlight, the king's daughter, who was no more than twelve, said to Mantling Bory, 'You know that my father is a great sorcerer.' . 'Really?' said the artless Mantling Bory. 'Why yes, you mean you did not know? Well anyway, his power lies in the game of wori; 34 you can play wori.' 'My _brother now, he is"a great sorcerer.' 'No doubt he does not come up to my father.' 'But what did you say? Your father plays at wori?' Just then Sogolon called the children because the moon had just waned. 'Mother is calling us,' said_ Sundiata, who was stan~ing at one side. 'Come Mantling Bory. If I am not mistaken, you are fond of that daughter of Mansa Konkon's.' 'Yes brother, but I would have you know that to drive a cow into the stable it is necessary to take the calf in.' 'Of course, the cow will follow the kidnapper. But take care, for if the cow is in a rage so much the worse for the kid. napper.' The two brothers went in swopping proverbs. Men's wisdom is -! contained in proverbs and when children wield proverbs it is a sign that they have profited from adult company. That morning Sundiata and Mantling Bory did not leave the royal enclosure but played with the king's children beneath the meeting tree. 35 At the beginning of the afternoon Mansa Konkon ordered the son of Sogolon into his palace. The king lived in a veritable maze and after several twists and turns through dark corridors a servant left Djata in a badly-lit room. He looked about him but was not afraid. Fear enters the heart of him who does not know his destiny, whereas Sundiata knew that he was striding towards a great destiny.á He did not know what fear was. When his eyes were accustomed to the semi-darkness, Sundiata saw the king sitting with his back to the light on a great ox-hide. He saw some splendid weapons hanging on the walls and exclaimed: 'What beautiful weapons you have, Mansa Konkon,' 30 and, seizing a sword, he began to fence on his own against_ an ima~-in.ary foe. The king, astonished, watched the extraordmary child. 'You had me sent for,' said the latter, 'and here I am.' He hun ~ the sword back up. 'Sit down' said the king. 'It is a habit with me to invite my guests to pl;y, so we are going to play, we are going to play at wori. But I make rather unusual conditions; if I win-and I shall win-I kill you.' 'And if it is I who win,' said Djata without being put out. 'In that case I will give you all that you ask of me. But I would have you know that I always win.' , . 'If I win I ask for nothing more than that sword, said Sun.diata, pointing to the sword he had brandished. , 'All right,' said the king, 'you are sure of yourself, eh? He drew up the log in which the wori holes were dug and put four pebbles in each of the holes. 'I go first,' said the king, and taking the four ~ebbles from one hole he dealt them .out, punctuating his actions with these words: 'I don don, don don Kokodji. Wori is the invention of a hunter. I don don, don don Kokodji. I am unbeatable at this game. I-am called the "exterminator king".' And Sundiata, taking the pebbles from another hole, con. tinued: 'I don don, don don Kokodji. Forrnerly guests were sacred. I don don, don don Kokodji. But the gold came only yesterday. Whereas I came before yesterday.' 1Someone has betrayed me,' roared the king Mansa Konkon, 1someone has betrayed me.' 'No king do not accuse anybody,' said the child. ' ' 'What then?' 'It is nearly three moons since I have beeh living with you and you have never up to now suggested a game of wori. God is the guest's tongue. My words express only the truth because I am your guest.' The truth was that the queen mother of Niani had sent gold to Mansa Konkon so that he would get rid of Sundiata: 'the gold came only yesterday', and Sundiata yvas at the king's court prior to the gold. In fact, the king's daughter had revealed the secret to ¥ Mantling Bory. Then the king, in confusion, said, 'You have won, but you will not have what you asked for, and I will turn you out of my town.' 'Thank you for two months' hospitality, but I will return, Mansa Konkon.' Once again Sogolon and her children took to the path of exile. They went away from the river and headed west. They were going to seek hospitality from the king of Tabon in the country which is called the Fouta Djallon today. This region was at that time inhabited by the Kamara blacksmiths and the Djallonkes. 37 Tabon was an impregnable town firmly entrenched behind mountains, and the king had been for a long time an ally of the Niani court. His son, Fran Kamara, had been one of the com.panions of Suncliata. After Sogolon's departure from Niani the companion princes of Sundiata had been sent back to their respective families. But the king of Tabon was already old and did not want to fall out with whoever ruled at Niani. He welcomed Sogolon with kindness and advised her to go away as far as possible. He sug.gested the court of Ghana, 38 whose king he knew. A caravan of merchants was shortly leaving for Ghana. The old king com.mended Sogolon and her children to the merchants and even delayed the departure for a few days to allow the mother to recover a little from her fatigues. It was with joy that Sundiata and Mantling Bory met Fran Kamara again. The latter, not without pride, showed them round the fortresses of Tabon and had them admire the huge iron gates and the king's arsenals. Fran Kamara was very glad to receive Sundiata at his home but was very grieved when the fatal day arrived, the day of departure. The night before he had given a hunting party to the princes of Mali and the youngsters had talked in the bush like men. ''When .I go back to Mali,' Sundiata had said, 'I will pass 51 through Tabon to pick you up and we will go to Mali_ togeth:r-' 'Between now and then we will have grown up, Mantling Bory had added. 'I will have all the army of Tabon for my own,' Fran Kamara had said, 'The blacksmiths and the Djallonkes are excellent war.riors. I already attend the gathering of armed men which my father holds once a year.' 'I will make you a great general, we will travel through many countries and emerge the strongest of all. Kings will tremble before us as a woman trembles before a man.' The son of Sogolon had spoken thus. The exiles took to the road again. Tabon was very far from Ghana, 39 but the merchants were good to Sogolon and her children. The king had provided the mounts and the caravan headed to the north, leaving the land of Kita on the right. On the way the merchants told the princes a great deal about events of the past. Mari Djata was particularly interested in the stories bearing on the great king of the day, Soumaoro Kante. It was to him at Sosso that Balla Fasseke had gone as envoy. Djata learnt that Saumaoro was the richest and most powerful king and even the king of Ghana paid him tribute. He was also a man of great cruelty. The country of Ghana is a dry region where water is short. Formerly the Cisses of Ghana were the most powerful of princes. They were descended from Alexander the Great, the Icing of gold and silver, but ever since the Cisses had broken the ancestral taboo¥¥ their power had kept on declining. At the time of Sun.diata the descendants of Alexander were paying tribute to the king of Sosso. After several days of travelling the caravan arriv:d outside Wagadou. The merchants showed Sogolon and her chil.dren the great forest of Wagadou, where the great serpent-god used to live. 4 1 The town was surrounded with enormous walls, very badly maintained. The travellers noticed that there were a lot of white traders at Wagadou 42 and many encampments were to be seen all around the town. Tethered camels were every.where. Ghana was the land of the Soninke, 43 and the people there did not speak Mandingo any more, but nevertheless there were many people who understood it, for the Soninke travel a lot. They are great traders. Their donkey caravans came heavily laden to Niani every dry season. They would set themselves up behind the town and the inhabitants would come out to barter. The merchants made their way towards the colossal city gate. The head of the caravan spoke to the guards and one of them beckoned to Sundiata and his family to follow him, and they entered the city of the Cisses. The terraced houses did not have straw roofs in complete contrast to the towns of Mali. There were also a lot of mosques in this city, but that did not astonish Sun. diata in the least, for he knew that the Cisses ]"ere very reli. gious;44 at Niani there was only one mosque. The travellers ¥ noticed that the anterooms were incorporated in the houses whereas in Mali the anteroom or 'bollon' was a separate build. ing. As it was evening everybody was making his way to the mosque. The travellers could understand nothing of the prattle which the passers-by exchanged when they saw them on their way to the palace. The palace of the king of Ghana was an imposing building. The walls were very high and you would have thought it was a dwelling-place for jinn not for men. Sogolon and her children were received by the king's brother, who understood Mandingo. The king was at prayer, so his brother made them co1nfortable in an enormous room and water was brought for them tq quench their thfrst. After the prayer the king came back into his palace and received the strangers. His brother acted as interpreter. 'The king greets the strangers.' 'We greet the king of Ghana,' said Sogolon. . 'The strangers have entered Wagadou in peace, may peace be upon them in our city.' 1S0 be it.' 'The king gives the strangers permission to speak.' 'We are from Mali,' began Sogolon. 'The father of my children was the king Nare Maghan, who, a few years ago sent a good.will embassy to Ghana. My husband is dead but the council has not respected his wishes and my eldest son,' (she pointed to Sundiata) 'has been excluded from the throne. The son of my ) co-wife was preferred before him. I have known exile. The hate , of my co-wife has hounded me out of every town and I have trudged along every road with my children. Today I have come to ask for asylum with the Cisses of Wagadou.' There was silence for a few moments; during Sogolon's speech the king and his brother had not taken their eyes off Sundiata for an instant. Any other child of eleven would have been discon.certed by the eyes of adults, but Sundiata kept cool and calmly looked at the rich decorations of the king's reception hall-the rich carpets, the fine scimitars hanging on the wall-and the splendid garments of the courtiers. To the great astonishment of Sogolon and her children the king also spoke in the very same Mandingo language. 'No stranger has ever found our hospitality wanting. My court is your court and my palace is yours. Make yourself at home. Consider that in coming from Niani to Wagadou you have done no more than change rooms. The friendship which unites Mali 'I I, '&gt;, and Ghana goes back to a very distant age, as the elders and griots know. The people of Mali are our cousins.' And, speaking to Sundiata, the king said in a familiar tone of voice, 'Approach, cousin, what is your name?' 'My name is Mari-Djata and I am also called Maghan, but most commonly people call me Sundiata. As for my brother, he is called Mantling Boukary, my youngest sister is called Djamarou and the other Sogolon-Kolonkan.' 'There's one that will make a great king. He forgets nobody,' Seeing that Sogolon was very tired, the king said, 'Brother, look after our guests. Let Sogolon and her children be royally treated i and from tomorrow let the princes of Mali sit among our children.' ! Sogolon recovered fairly quickly from her exertions. She was treated like a queen at the court of king Soumaba Cisse. The children were clothed in the same fashion as those of Wagadou. Sundiata and Mantling Bory had long smocks splendidly em.broidered. They were showered with so many attentions that Mantling Bory was embarrassed by them, but Sundiata found it quite natural to be treated like this. _Modesty is the portion of the av~rage man, but._ superio~ men are ignorant of .h~mility._ -Sundiata even became exacting, and the more exacting he became the more the servants trembled before him. He was held in high esteem by the king, who said to his brother one day, 'If he has a kingdom one day everything will obey him because he knows how to command.' However, Sogolon found no more lasting peace at Wagadou than she had found at the courts of Djedeba or Tabon; she fell ill after a year. 34 ! King Soumaba Cisse decided to send Sogolon and her people to Merna to the court of his cousin, Tounkara. Merna was the capital ! of a great kingdom on the Niger beyond the land of Do. The king reassured Sogolon of the welcome she would be given there. ! Doubtless t.lie air_ which blew from the river would be. able.to ,', r~store Sogolon's health. á The children were sorry to leave Wagadou for they had made f many friends, but their destiny lay elsewhere and they had to go away. King Soumaba Cisse entrusted the travellers to some merchants á who were going to Merna. It was a large caravan and the journey was done by camel. The children had for a long time accustomed themselves to these anima1s which were unknown in Mali. The king had introduced Sogolon and her children as members of his family and they were thus treated with much consideration by the merchants. Always keen to learn, Sundiata asked the cara.vaneers many questions. They were very well-informed people and told Sundiata a lot of things. He was told about the countries beyond Ghana; the land of the Arabs; the Hejaz, cradle of Islam and of Djata's ancestors (for Bibali Bounama, the faithful se,:vant of the Prophet, came from Hejaz). He learnt many thmgs about Alexander the Great, too, but it was with terror that .J the merchants spoke of Soumaoro, the sorcerer-king, the plun.derer who would rob the merchants of everything when he was in a bad mood. ~ courier, despatched earlier from Wagadou, had heralded the arrival of Sogolon at Merna; a great escort was sent to meet the travellers and a proper reception was held before Merna. Archers and spearmen formed up in a double line and the merchants show~d. even more respect to their travellingá companions. Surpnsmgly enough, the king was absent. It was his sister who had organized this great reception. The whole of Merna was at the city gate and you would have thought it was the king's homecommg. Here many people could speak Mandingo and Sogolon and her children could understand the amazement of the people, who were saying to each other, 'Where do they come from? Who are they?' The king's sister received Sogolon and her children in the pal_ace. She spoke Maninkakan 46 very well and talked to Sogolon as if she had known her for a long time. She lodged Sogolon in a 35 wing of the palace. As usual, Sundiata very soon made his presence felt among the young princes of Merna and in a few days he knew every corner of the royal enclosure. The air of Merna, the air of the river, did Sogolon's health a lot of good, but she was even more affected by the friendliness of the king's sjster, who was called Massiran. Massiran disclosed to Sogolon that the king had no children and that the new com.panions of Sundiata were only the sons of Merna's vassal kings. , The king had gone on a campaign against the mountain tribes ' who Jived on the other side of the river. It was like this every year, because as soon as these tribes were left in peace they came I down from the mountains to pillage the country. Sundiata and Manding Bory again took up their favourite .pastime, hunting, and went out with the young vassals of Merna. At the approach of the rainy season the king's return _was announced. The city of Merna gave a triumphal welcome to its king. Moussa Tounkara, richly dressed, was riding on a mag. nificent horse while his formidable cavalry made an impressive escort. The infantry marched in ranks carrying on their heads the booty taken from the enemy. The war drums rolled while the captives, heads lowered and hands tied behind their backs, moved forward mournfully to the accompaniment of the crowd's derisive laughter. When the king was in his palace, Massiran, his sister, introduced Sogolon and her children and handed him the letter from the king of Ghana. Moussa Tounkara was very affable and said to Sogolon, 'My cousin Soumaba recommends you and that is enough. You are at home. Stay here as long as you wish.' It was at the court of Merna that Sundiata and Mantling Bory went on their first campaign. Moussa Tounkara was a great warrior and therefore he admired strength. When Sundiata was fifteen the king took him with him on campaign. Sundiata astonished the whole army with his strength and with his dash in the charge. In the course of a skirmish against the moun.taineers he hurled himself on the enemy with such vehemence that the king feared for his life, but Mansa Tounkara admired bravery too much to stop the son of Sogolon. He followed him closely to protect him and he saw with rapture how the youth sowed panic among the enemy. He had remarkable presence of mind, struck right and left and opened up for himself a glorious path, When the enemy had fled the old 'sofas' 46 said, 'There's one that'll make a good king.' Moussa Tounkara took the son of Sologon in his arms and said, 'It is destiny that has sent you to Merna. I will make a great warrior out of you.' From that day Sundiata did not leave the king any more. He eclipsed all tbe young princes and was the friend of the whole army. They spoke about nothing but him in the camp. Men were even more surprised by the lucidity of his mind. In the camp he had an answer to everything and the most puzzling situations resolved th0mselves in his presence. . Soon it was in Merna itself that people began to talk about Sundiata. Was it not Providence which had sent this boy at a time when Merna had no heir? People already averred that Sun.diata would extend his dominion from Merna to Mali. He went on all the campaigns. The eneniy's incursions became rarer and rarer and the reputation of Sogolon's son spread beyond the river. After three years the king appointed Sundiata Kan-Koro-Sigui, his Viceroy, and in the king's absence it was he who governed. Djata had now seen eighteen winters and at that time he was a tall young man with a fat neck and a powerful chest. Nobody else could bend his bow. Everyone bowed before him and he was greatly loved. Those who did not Jove him feared him and his voice carried authority. The king's choice was approved of both by the army and the people; the ..peop]e_Jove all who assert themselves over them .. The soothsayers of M~m;;-á r~vealed the extraordinary desti;,_y of Djata. lt was said that he was the successor of Alexander the Great and that he would be even greater; the soldiers already had.,.¥ thousand dreams of conquest. What was impossible with such a gallant chief? Sundiata inspired confidence in the sofas by his example, for the sofa loves to see his chief share the hardship of battle. Djata was now a man, for time had marched on since the exodus from Niani and his destiny was now to be fulfilled. Sogolon knew that the time had arrived and she had performed her task. She. had nurtured the son for whom the world was wait.ing and she knew t_hat now her mission was accomplished, while that of Djata was about to begin. One day she said to her son, 57 1 ,-'Do not deceive yourself. Your destiny lies not here but in Mali. '1 The moment has come. I have finished my task and it is yours ', that is going to begin, my son. But you must be able to wait. l~verything in its own good time.' Soumaoro Kante, the Sorcerer King While Sogolon's son was fighting his first campaign far from his native land, Mali had fallen under the domination of a new master, Soumaoro Kant0, king of Sosso. When the embassy sent by Dankaran Touman arrived at Sosso Suomaoro demanded that Mali should acknowledge itself tribu~ary to Sosso. Balla Fasseke found delegates from several other kingdoms at Soumaoro's court. With his powerful army of smiths the king of Sosso had quickly imposed his power on every.body. After the defeat of Ghana and Diaghan 41 no one _dared ¥ oppose him any more. Soumaoro was descended from the !me of smiths called Diarisso who first harnessed fire and taught men how to work iron, but for a long time Sosso had remained a little village of no significance. The powerful king of Ghana was the i master of the country. Little by little the kingdom of Sosso had 1. grown at the expense of Ghana and now the Kantes domi~ated j , their old masters. Like all masters of fire, Soumaoro Kante was a great sorcerer. His fetishes 48 had a terrible p~wer and it was because of them that all kings trembled before him, for he could deal a swift death to whoever he pleased. He had fortified Sosso with a triple curtain wall and in the middle of the town loomed his palace, towering over the thatched huts o~ the vill_ages. ¥¥ He had had an immense seven-storey tower bmlt for himself and he lived on the seventh floor in the midst of his fetishes. This is why he was called 'The Untouchable King'. Soumaoro let the rest of the Mandingo embassy return but he kept Balla Fasseke back and threatened to destroy Niani i~ Dankaran Touman did not make his submission. Frightened, the son of Sassouma immediately made his submission, and he even sent his sister, Nana Triban, to the king of Sosso. One day when the king was away, Balla Fasseke managed to 38 get right into the most secret chamber Soumaoro safeguarded his fetishes. When open he was transfixed with amazement ri ,1¥.f\\lrJJáá,&lt;,r-ác' if~, I of the palace where he had pushed the door at what he saw. The walls of the chamber were tapestried with human skins and , there was one in the middle of the room on which the king sat; around aná earthenware jar nine heads formed _a circle; when Balla had opened the door the water.had become disturbed and a monstrous snake had raised its head. Balla Fasseke, who was also well versed in sorcery, recited some formulas and everything in the room fell quiet, so he continued his inspection. He saw on a perch above the bed three owls which seemed to be asleep; on the far wall hung strangely-shaped weapons, curved swords and knives with three cutting edges. He looked at the skulls atten..tively and recognized the nine kings killed by Soumaoro. To the right of the door he discovered a great balafon, bigger than he had ever seen in Mali. Instinctively he pounced upon it and sat down to play. The griot always has a weakness for music, for music is the griot's soul. He began to play. He had never heard such a melodious bala.fon. Though scarcely touched by the hammer, the resonant wood gave out sounds of an infinite sweetness, notes clear and as pure as gold dust; under the skilful hand of Balla the instrument had found its master. He played with all his soul and the whole room was filled with wonderment. The drowsy owls, eyes half closed, . began to move their heads as though with satisfaction. Every. thing seemed to come to lifeá upon the strains of this magic music. The nine skulls resumed their earthly forms_ aJI.d b)i11l&lt;;~,! ?t 1?:,~_~rfo."g:J]i_~~~Ji.1!1_~---~.Y~~!~r~_)áu~-~(~th its head resting on ;so the rim, the snake seemed to listen from the jar. Balla Fasseke was pleased at the effect his music had had on the strange in.habitants of this ghoulish chamber, but he quite understood that this balafon was not at all like any other. It was that of a great sorcerer. Soumaoro was the only one to play this instrument. After each victory he would come and sing his own praises. No griot had ever touched it. Not all ears were made to hear that music. Soumaoio was constantly in touch with this xylophone and no matter how far away he was, one only had to touch it for him to know that someone had got into his secret chamber. The king was not far from the town and he rushed back to his palace and climbed up to the seventh storey. Balla Fasseke heard hurried steps in the corridor and Soumaoro bounded into the room, sword in hand. 'Who is there?' he roared. 'It is you, Balla Fasseke!' The king was foaming with anger and his eyes burnt fiercely like hot embers. Yet without losing his composure the son of Doua changed key and improvised a song in honour of the king: There he is, Soumaoro Kante. All hail, you who sit on the skins of kings. All hail, Simbon of the deadly arrow. I salute you, y.9.~_.whowear clothes.~£ hun1a11 __s~in. This improvised tune greatly pleased Soumaoro and he had never heard such fine words. Kings are only men, and whatever iron cannot achieve against them, words can. Kings, too, are susceptible to flattery, so Soumaoro's anger abated, his heart filled with joy as he listened attentively to this sweet music; All hail, you who wear clothes of human skin. I salute you, you who sit on the skins of kings. Balla sang and his voice, which was beautiful, delighted the king of Sosso. 'How sweet it is to hear one's praises sung by someone else; Balla Fasseke, you will nevermore return to Mali for from today you are my griot.' ( Thus Balla Fasseke, whom king Nare Maghan had given to his son Sundiata, was stolen from the latter by Dankaran Touman; now it was the king of Sosso, Soumaoro Kante,who, in turn, stole ¥ the precious griot from the son of Sassouma Berete. In this way war between Sundiata __and Soullla.oro b_ecame inevitable_. --ááá--áá-----------------á--á----... -áá-á --á History We are now coming to the great moments in the life of Sundiata. The exile will end and another sun will arise. It is the sun of Sundiata. Griots know the history of kings and kingdoms and that is why they are the best counsellors of kings. Every king wants to ha Ve a singer to perpetuate his memory, for it is the j. griot who rescues the men10ries of kings from oblivion, as men . have short memories. Kings have prescribed destinies just like men, and seers who 1 probe the future know it.

What paltry learning is that which is congealed in dumb books! I, Djeli Mamoudou Kouyate, am the result of a long tradition. For generations we have passed on the history of kings from father to son. The narrative was passed on to me without altera.tion and I deliver it without alteration, for I received it free from all untruth. Listen now to the story of Sundiata, the Na'Kamma, the man who had a mission to accomplish. At the time when Sundiata was preparing to assert his claim over the kingdom of his fathers, Soumaoro was the king of kings, the most powerful king in all the lands of the setting sun. The fortified town of Sosso was the bulwark of fetishism against the"' word of Allah. For a long time Soumaoro defied the whole world. Since his accession to the throne of Sosso he had defeated nine kings whose heads served him as fetishes in his macabre cham.ber, Their skins served as seats and he cut his footwear from human skin. Soumaoro was not like other men, for the jinn had revealed themselves to him and his power was beyond measure. So his countless sofas were very brave since they believed their king to be invincible. But Soumaoro was an evil demon and his reign had produced nothing but bloodshed . .N-21hiJJg._w_as_taboo .. for him. His greatest pleasure was publicly to flog venerable old men. He had defiled every family and everywhere in his vast empire there were villages populated by girls whom he had forcibly abducted from their families without marrying them. The tree th(t the tempest will throw down does not see the storm building up on the horizon. Its proud head braves the winds even when it is near its end. Soumaoro had come to _despise 41 ( everyone. Oh! how power can pervert a man. If man had but a mithkal 62 of divine power at his disposal the world would have been annihilated long ago. Soumaoro arrived at a point where he á would stop at nothing. His chief general was his nephew the smith, Fakoli Koroma. He was the son of Soumaoro's sister, Kassia. Fakoli had a wonderful wife, Keleya, who was a great magician like her husband. She could cook better than the three hundred wives of Soumaoro put together. 63 Soumaoro adbucted Keleya and locked her up in his palace. Fakoli fell into a dreadful ¥ rage and went to his uncle and said, 'Since you are not as-hamed to commit incest by taking my wife, I am freed from all my ties with you from this day forward. Henceforth I shall be on the side of your enemies. I shall combine insurgent Mandingoes with my own troops and wage war against you.' And he left Sosso with the smiths of the Koroma tribe. It was like a signal. All those long-repressed hates and ran. Cours burst out and everywhere men answered the call of Fakoli. Straight away Dankaran Touman, the king of Mali, mobilized and marched to join Fakoli. But Soumaoro, casting his nephew's threat aside, swooped down on Dankaran Touman, who gave up the struggle and fled to the land of the cola; and in those forested regions he founded the town of Kissidougou. ¥¥ During this period Soumaoro, in his anger, punished all the Mandingo towns which had revolted. He destroyed the town of Nialli and reduced it to ashes. The inhabitants cursed the king who had fled. ¥ It is in the midst of calamity that man questions himself about his destiny. After the flight of Dankaran Touman, Soumaoro proclaimed himself king of Mali by right of conquest, but he was not recognized by the populace and resistance was organized in the bush. Soothsayers were consulted as to the fate of the country. The soothsayers were unanimous in saying that it would be the rightful heir to the throne who would save Mali. This heir was 'The Man with Two Names'. The elders of the court of Niani then remembered the son of Sogolon. The man '1Vithtwo names was no other than Maghan Sundiata. viJ ,r ... , ' .. ' he~~~;d~:; 1~~~1~ ;::;e~e:ni~:; ~::o:e:a;t:; ~~r!:::no~ them. Now the problem was to find them. Nevertheless a search party was formed to seek him outd'Among the people included .''1nust be mentionedá Kountoun M~nian, an old griot from the 4z court ~f Nare Maghan; Mandjan Berete, a brother of Sassouma's, ":ho did not want to follow Dankaran Touman in flight; Sing. bin Mara C1sse, a divine of the court; Siriman Toure another divine; and, finally, a woman, Magnouma. According to'the clues of the soothsayers they had to search towards the riverine lands that is, towards the east. The searchers left Mali while wa:. raged between Sosso Soumaoro and his nephew Fakoli Koroma. The Baobab Leaves At Merna Sundiata learnt that Soumaoro had invaded Mali and that his own brother, Dankaran Touman, had fled. He learnt also that Fakoli was holding his own against the king of Sosso. That year the kingdom of Merna was at peace and the king's viceroy had a lot of leisure time. As always, he went out hunting, but since the news about Mali had arrived Sundiata had become very gloomy. The aged Sogol on was ill. Man ding Bory was fifteen and was now a lively youth like his brother and friend Sundiata. Djata's sisters had grown up and Kolonkan was now a tall maiden of marriageable age. Now that Sogolon had grown old it was she á who did the cooking and she often went to the town market with her serving women. Well, one day when she was at the market she noticed a woman who was offering for sale nafiola 55 and gnougou, condiments á unknown to the people of Merna, who looked in astonishment at the woman who was selling them. Kolonkan approached. She recognized baobab leaves and many other vegetables which her mother used to grow in her garden at Niani. 'Baobab leaves,' she muttered, 'and gnougou, I know these,' she said, taking some. 'How do you know them princess?' said the woman. 'I have been offering them for sale here in the market of Merna for days but nobody wants any here.' 'But I am from Mali. At home my mother used to have a vegetable g,irden and my brother would go to seek baobab leaves .for us.' \ 'What is your brother's name princess?' 'He is called SogolOII Djata, aild the other 0I1e is called MaI1.diI1g Bory. I also have a sister called Sogolon Djamarou.' Meanwhile a man had. drawn near and he spoke thus to Sogo. lon Kolonkan, 'Princess, we.are also from Mali. We are merchants and are going from town .to town. I am selling colas myself. Here, I give you one. Princess, could your mother receive us today?' 'Of course, she will be happy to talk to people who come from Mali. Don't budge from here and I'll go and talk to her about it.' Kolonkan, without caring about the scandal of the viceroy's sister being seen running across the market-place, had knotted her long dress about her middle and was running at full speed towards the royal enclosure. 'N'na, 56 she sa:id, out of breath and addressing her mother, 'I have found baobab leaves, gnougou and many other things at the market, look. Some merchants from Mali are seJ!ing them. They would like to see you.' Sogolon took the baobab leaves and gnougou in her hand and put her nose to them as though to inhale all the scent. She opened her eyes wide and looked at her daughter. 'They come from Mali, you say? Then run to the market and tell them that I am waiting for them, run, my daughter.' Sogolon remained alone. She was turning the precious condi.ments over and over in her hands when she heard Sundiata and Mantling Bory returning from the hunt. 'Hail, mother. We have returned,' said Mantling Bory. 'Hail, mother,' said Sundiata, 'we have brought you some game.' 'Come in and sit down,' she said, and held out to them what she had in her hand. 'Why, it's gnougou,' said Sundiata, 'where did you find it? The people here grow it very little.' 'Yes, some merchants from Mali are offering it for sale in the market. Ko!onkan has gone to fetch them for they want to see me. We are going to have some news of Mali.' Kolonkan soon appeared followed by four men and a woman; straight away Sogolon recognized the eminent members of her husband's court. The salutations began and greetings were ex. changed with all the refinement demanded by Mandingo cour.tesy. At last Sogolon said, 'Here are my children; they have grown up far from their native country. Now let us talk of Mali.' The travellers quickly exchanged meaningful glances, then Mandjan Berete, Sassouma's brother, began to speak in these words: 'I give thanks to God the Almighty that we are here in the presence of Sogolon and her children. I give thanks to God that our journey will not have been in vain. It is two months since we left Mali. We went from one royal town to another posing as merchants and Magnouma offered vegetables of Mali for sale. In these eastern lands people are unacquainted with these vege.tables. But at Merna our plan worked out perfectly. The person who bought some gnougou was able to tell us of your fate and that person, by a crowning stroke of fortune, turned out to be Sogolon Kolonkan.' 'Alas! I bring you sad tidings. That is my mission. Soumaoro Kante, the powerful king of Sosso, has heaped death and desola.tion upon Mali. The king, Dankaran Touman, has fled and Mali is without áa master, but the war is not finished yet. Courageous men have taken to the bush and are waging tireless war against the enemy. Fakoli Koroma, the nephew of the king of Sosso, is fighting pitilessly against his incestuous uncle who robbed him of his wife. We have consulted the jinn and they have replied that only the son of Sogolon can deliver Mali. Mali is saved because we have found you, Sundiata.' -á 'Maghan Sundiata, I salute you; king of Mali, the throne of 1 your fathers awaits you. Whatever rank you may hold here, leave all these honours and come and deliver your fatherland. The brave await you, come and restore rightful authority to Mali. Weeping mothers pray only in your name, the assembled kings await you, for: your name alone inspires confidence in them. Son of Sogolon, your hour has come, the words of the old Gnan.kouman Doua are about to cOme to pass, for you 8.re the giant who will crush the giant Soumaoro.' After these words a profound silence reigned over the room of Sogolon. She, her eyes cast down, remained silent; Kolonkan and Mantling Bory had their eyes fixed on Sund1ata. 'Very well,' he said, 'it is no longer the time for words. I am going to ask the king's leave and we will return immediately. Manding Bory, take charge of the envoys from Mali. The king 45 t__ .return this evening ~ill and we will set out first thi_ng to~orrow&lt;7 Sundiata got up and all the envoys stood up _while D1ata went out. He was already king. The king returned to Merna at nightfall. He had gone to spend the day in one of his neighbouring residences. The viceroy was not at the king's reception and nobody knew where he was. He returned at night and before going to bed he vv:ent and saw Sogolon. She had a fever and was trembling under the blankets. With a feeble voice she wished her son good night. When Sun. i' diata was in his chamber alone he turned to the east and spoke thus: 'Almighty God, the time for action has come. If I must sue-. ceed in the reconquest of Mali, Almighty, grant that I may bury my mother in peace here.' Then he lay down. r------Tnthe morning, Sogolon Kedjou, the buffalo woman, passed 1. away, and all the court of Merna went into mourning, for the viceroy's mother was dead. Sundiata went to see the king, who offered his condolences. He said to the king, 'King, you gave me hospitality at your court when I was without shelter. Under your orders I went on my first campaign. I shall never be able to thank you for so much kindness. However, my mother is dead; but ] am now a man and I must return to Mali to claim the kingdom of my fathers. Oh king, I give you back the powers you conferred upon me, and I ask leave to depart. In any case, allow . me to bury my mother before I go.' These words displeased the king. Never did he think that the son of Sogolon could leave him. What was he going to seek in . Mali? Did he not live happy and árespected by all at Merna? Was he not already the heir to the throne of Merna? How un.grateful, thought the king, !_he son of another is always tile son of.another. á-á'Ungrateful creature,' said the king, 'since thi~ is how_it is, _go away, leave my kingdom, but take your mothers remains with you; you will not bury her at Merna.' . . _ But after a pause he went on, 'Very well then, since you 1ns1st on burying your mother, you will pay me the price of the earth where she will lie.' 'I will pay later,' replied Sundiata. 'I will pay when I reach Mali.' 'No, now, or you will have to take your mother's corpse with you.' 46 -p,...:n.,_/-. ':;,F¥ ~('á\\~,-¥, """""'"""""á-.-~""""''"'~,~~:,..o~-;.;;ft~l~/ái,,lli::..lf.i:.-~ Then Sundiata got up and went out. He came back after a short while and brought the king a basket full of bits of pottery, guinea fowl feathers, feathers of young partridges and wisps of straw. He said, 'Very well king, here is the price of the land.' 'You are mocking, Sundiata, take your basket of rubbish away. That is not the price of the land. What do you mean by it?' Then the old Arab who was the king's adviser said, 'Oh king~\ give this young man the land where his mother must rest. \ What he has brought you has a meaning. If you refuse him the : land he will make war on you. These broken pots and wisps of :,. straw indicate that he will destroy the town. It will only be recognized by the fragments of broken pots. He will make such a ruin of it that guinea-fowl and young partridges will come to take their dust baths there. Give him the land for if he recon.quers his kingdom he will deal gently with you, your family, and his will be forever allied.' The king understood. He gave him the land and Sogolon received her funeral honours with all the regal obsequies. The Return Every man to his own land! If it is foretold that your destin;:\; ,,,,.,, ,, '" should be fulfilled in such and such a land, men can do nothin~ J against it. Mansa Tounkara could not keep Sundiata back because the destiny of Sogolon's son was bound up with that of Mali. Neither the jealousy of a cruel stepmother, nor her wickedness, could alter for a moment the course of great destiny. _,,...--/' The snake, man's enemy,.is not long-lived, yet the serpent that t., 1 lives' hidden will surely die old. Djata was strong enough now to face his enemies. At the age of eighteen he had the stateliness of the lion and the strength of the buffalo. His voice carried author.ity, his eyes were live coals, his arm was iron, he was the husband of power. Moussa Tounkara, king of Merna, gave Sundiata army. The most valiant came forward of their own follow Sundiata in the great adventure. The cavalry which he had fashioned himself, formed his iron half of his free will to of Merna, squadron. 47 . "':(' --=...e,ii_ ~ ,'á;::_: ... _,.~.: á ..,_,_.::=: ,1á,._d;;.lf.t'.~á::;;d á.~e~\-yL:~_ Sundiata, dressed in the Muslim fashion of Mema, left the town at the head of his small but redoubtable army. The whole popu.lation sent their best wishes with him. He was surrounded by five messengers from Mali and Mantling Bory rode proudly at the side of his brother. The horsemen of Merna formed behind Djata a bristling iron squadron. The troop took the direction of Waga.dou, for Djata did not have enough troops to confront Soumaoro directly, and so the king of Merna advised him to go to Wagadou and take half of the men of the king, Soumaba Cisse. A swift messenger had been sent there and so the king of W agadou came out in person to meet Sundiata and his troops. He gave Sundiata half of his cavalry and blessed the weapons. Then Mantling Bory said to his brother, 'Djata, do you think yourself able to face Soumaoro now?' 'No matter how small a forest may be, you can always find there sufficient fibres to tie up a man. Numbers mean nothing; it is worth that counts. With my cavalry I shall clear myself a path to Mali.' Djata gave out his orders. They would head south, skirting Soumaoro's kingdom: The firs: objective to be rea_ched was Tabon, the iron-gated town 1n the midst of the mountains, for Sundia\a had promised Fran Kamara that he would pass by Tabon before returning to Mali. He hoped to find that his childhood com.panion had become king. It was a forced march and during the halts the divines, Singbin Mara Cisse and Mandjan Berete, related to Sundiata the history of Alexander the Great and several other heroes, but of all of them Sundiata preferred Alexander, the king of gold and silver, who crossed the world from west to east. He wanted to outdo his prototype both in the extent of his territory and the wealth of his treasury. However, Soumaoro Kante, being a great sorcerer, knew that the. son ¥of Sogolon had set out and that he was coming to lay claim to l;Ylali. The soothsayers told him to forestall this calamity by attacking Sundiata, but good fortune makes men blind. Soumaoro was busy fighting Fakoli, the insurgent nephew who was holding out against him. Even before he had given battle the name of Sundiata was already well known throughout the king.dom. Those of the western frontier who had seen his army marching southwards spread extraordinary reports. Having. just ascended the throne that year, Fran Kamara, the friend of Sun.diata, had revolted in his turn against Soumaoro. In place áof the policy of prudence followed by the old king of Tabon, Fran Kamara pursued a policy of war. Proud of his troops and above all spurred on by the imminent arrival of Suncliata Fran Kamara now One of Tabon), called Tabon Wana (the Dread ' had called' to arms all the smiths and the mountain-dwelling Djallonkes. I Soumaoro sent a detachment under his son Sosso Balla to I block Sundiata's route to Tabon. Sosso Balla was about the same \ age as Sundiata. He promptly deployed his troops at the entrance I to the mountains to oppose Sundiata's advance to Tabon. In the evening, after a long day's march, Sundiata arrived afl the head of the great valley which led to Tabon. The valley was quite black with men, for Sosso Balla had deployed his men everywhere in the yalley, and some were positioned on the heights which dominated the way through. When Djata saw the layout of Sosso Balla's men he turned to his generals laughing. 'Why are you laughing, brother, you can see that the road is blocked.' , 'Yes, but no mere infantrymen can halt my course towards \ ¥Mali,' replied Sundiata. á The troops stopped. All the war chiefs were of the opinion that they should wait until the next day to give battle because, they said, the men were tired. 'The battle will not last Jong,' said Sundiata, 'and the men will have time to rest. We must not allow Soumaoro the time to attack Tabon.' Sundiata was immovable, so the orders were given and the wai\ __(.. drums began to beat. On his proud horse Sundiata turned to á, ' . right and left in front of his troops. He entrusted the rearguard, composed of a part of the Wagadou cavalry, to his younger brother Mantling Bory. Having drawn his sword, Sundiata led the charge, shouting his war cry. The Sossos were surprised by this sudden attack for they ali thought that the battle would be joined the next day. The light-!,-,,,ái ning that flashes across the sky is slower, the thunderbolts less , frightening and floodwaters less surprising than Sundiata swoop--á ing down on Sosso Balla and his smiths. In a trice, Sundiata was in the middle of the Sossos like a lion in the sheepfold. The Sossos, trampled under the hooves of his fiery charger, cried out. When he turned to the right the smiths of Soumaoro fell in their tens, and when he turned to the left his sword made heads fall as when someone shakes a tree of ripe fruit. The horsemen of Merna wrought a frightful slaughter and their long lances pierced flesh like a knife sunk into a paw-paw. Charging ever forwards, Sundiata looked for Sosso Balla; he caught sight of him and like a lion bounded towards the son of Soumaoro, his sword held aloft. His arm came sweeping down but at that moment a Sosso warrior came between Djata and Sosso Balla and áwas s1iced like a calabash. Sosso Balla did not wait and disappeared from amidst his smiths. Seeing their chief in flight, the Sossos gave way and fell into a terrible rout. Before the sun disappeared behind the mountains there were only Djata and his men left in the valley. Manding Bory, who was keeping an eye on the men perched on the heights, seeing that his brother had got the upper hand, dispatched some horsemen across the mountains to dislodge the Sossos. The Sossos were pursued until nightfall and several of them were taken prisoner. á.... Tabon Wana arrived too late, for the victory had already fallen to the son of Sogolon. The meeting of the two armies occasioned an all-night celebration in the very valley where the Sossos had been defeated. Tabon Wana Fran Kamara had a lot of food brought to the army of Sundiata and dancing went on all night, then at break of day the victors entered impregnable Tabon to the cheering of women standing on the ramparts. The news of the battle of Tabon spread like wildfire in the plains of Mali. It was known that Soumaoro was not present at the battle, but the mere fact that his troops had retreated before Sundiata sufficed to give hope to all the peoples of Mali. Sou. maoro realized that from now on he would have to reckon with this young man. He got to know of the prophecies of Mali, yet he was still too confident. When Sosso Balla returned with the remnant he had managed to save at Tabon, he said to his father, 'Father, he is worse than a lion; nothing can withstand him.' ; .. , 'Be quiet, you ill-starred son,' Soumaoro had said, 'what, you tremble before a lad of your own age!' Nonetheless, these words of Balla made a deep impression on Soumaoro and he decided to march on Tabon with the largest of his forces. The son of Sogolon had already decided on his plan of cam.paign-to beat Soumaoro, destroy Sosso and return triumphantly to Niani. He now had five army corps at his disposal, namely, the cavalry and infantry of Merna, those of Wagadou and the three . tribes forming the army of Tabon Wana Fran Kamara. He must assume the offensive as soon as possible. Soumaoro marched out to meet Sundiata. The meeting took place at Negueboria in the Boure country. 57 As usual, the son of Sogolon want~d t~ join battle_ straight away. Soumaoro thought to draw Sundiata mto the plam, but Sundiata did not allow him the time to do it. Compelled to give battle, the king of Sosso drew up his men across the narrow valley of Negueboria, the wings of h1s army occupymg the slopes. Sundiata adopted a very original form of deployment. He formed a tight square with all his cavalry in the front line. The archers of Wagadou and Tabon were stationed at the back. Soumaoro was on one of the hills do'."inating :he valley and he could be distinguished by his ~eight and h1s helmet bristling with horns. Under an overpower.mg sun the trumpets sounded, on both sides the drums and bolons echoed and courage entered the hearts of the Sofas. Sun.diata charged at the gallop and the valley soon disappeared in a cloud of red dust kicked up by thousands of feet and hooves. Without giving an inch, the smiths of Soumaoro stopped the wave. As though detached from the battle, Soumaoro Kante watched fro'." the top of his hill. Sundiata and the king of Tabon were laymg about them with mighty blows. Sundiata could be dis.tinguished by his white turban and Soumaoro could see the breach he was opening up in the middle of his troops. The centre was about to cave in under the crushing pressure of Djata. . Souma~ro made a sign and from the hills came smiths swoop.mg down mto the bottom of the valley to encircle Sundiata. Then without the slightest order from Sundiata, who was in the thick of the struggle, his square stretched and elongated itself into a great _rectangle. Everything had been foreseen. The change was so quick that Soumaoro's men, halted in their mad career could not use their weapons. In Djata's rear the archers of W;gadou and those of Tabon, on one knee, shot arrows into the sky which fell thickly, like a rain of iron, on the ranks of Soumaoro: Like a stretching piece of elastic, ))jata' s line ascended to attack the~ hills. Djata caught sight of Sosso Balla and bore down on him but the latter slipped away and the warriors of the buffalo wo~an's son raised a huzza of triumph. Soumaoro rushed up and his presence in the centre revived the courage of the Sossos. Sundiata caught sight of him and tried to cut a passage through to him. He struck to the right and struck to the left and trampled under. foot. The murderous hooves of his 'Daffeke' 68 dug into the chests of the Sossos. Soumaoro was nOw withi;n spear range arid Su'n. diata reared up his horse and hurled his weapon. It whistled away and bounced off Soumaoro's chest as off a rock and fell to the ground. Sogolon's son bent his bow but with a motion of theá hand Soumaoro caught the arrow in flight and showed it to Sundiata as if to say 'Look, I am invulnerable.' Furious, Sundiata snatched up his spear and with his head bent charged at Soumaoro, but as he raised his arm to sirike his enemy he noticed that Soumaoro had disappeared. Mantling Bory riding at his side pointed to the hill and said, 'Look, brother.' Sundiata saw Soumaoro on the hill, sitting on his black-coated horse. How could he have done it, he who was only two paces from Sundiata? By what power had he spirited himself away on to the hill? The son of Sogolon stopped fighting to watch the king of Sosso. The sun was already very low and Soumaoro's smiths gave way but Sundiata did not give the order to pursue the enemy. Suddenly, Soumaoro disappeared! How can I vanquish a man capable of disappearing and re.appearing where and when he likes? How can I affect a man in.vulnerable to iron? Such were the questions which Sogolon's son asked himself. He had been told many things about Sosso.Soumaoro but he had given little credence to so much gossip. Didn't people say that Soumaoro could assume sixty-nine differ. ent shapes to escape his enemies? According to some, he could transform himself into a fly in the middle of the battle and come and torment his opponent; he could melt into the wind when his enemies encircled him too closely-and many other things. The battle of Negueboria showed Djata, if he needed to be shown, that to beat the king of Sosso other weapons were necessary. The evening of Negueboria, Sundiata was master of the field, but he was in a gloomy mood. He went away from the field of battle with its agonized cries of the wounded, and Mantling Bory and Tabon Wana watched him go. He headed for the hill where he had seen Soumaoro after his miraculous disappearance from the midst of his troops. From the top of the hill he watched the compact mass of Soumaoro's smiths withdrawing in a cloud of dust. 'How was he able to escape me? Why did neither my spear nor/áá',,á my arrow wound him?' he wondered. 'What is the jinn that pro-, tects Soumaoro? What is the mystery of his power?' ---' His dismounted from his horse and picked up a piece of theá\ . earth which Soumaoro's horse had trampled on. Complete dark-i, ness had already fallen, the village of Negueboria was not fará' away and the Djallonkes came out in a crowd to greet Sundiata and his men. The fires were already lit in the camp and the soldiers were beginning to prepare a meal, but what was their joy when they saw a long procession of girls from Negueboria carry.ing on their heads enormous gourds of rice. All the sofas took up the girls' song in chorus. The chief of the village and its notables followed behind. Djata came down from the hill and received the Djallonke chief of Negueboria, who was a vassal of Tabon Wana. For the sofas the day had been a victory because Sou.maoro had fled, so the drums of war became drums of joy and Djata let his men celebrate what they called a victory. He stayed in his tent. Iu.th.e.JmuiLese,,ry_m,an therecomes a moment when doubt settles in and the ma~ 9.ue;ti~pi i,;;;;;elf ~n 4i~oyvn_~_,zs,.. tiiiy,_b_ui: áonthis evening it was not yet .c\ouht which assailed.'. 'Djata, for he was thinking rather of what powers he .CPul.d employ to i'njure Sosso-Soumaoro. He did not sleep that night. At daybreak they struck camp. Peasants on their line of march á told Sundiata that Soumaoro and his men were making a forced march without stopping so only in the evening did Sundiata halt the army to take a little food and rest. This was near the village of Kankigne. The men set up camp in the middle of the plain whilst guards were stationed on the heights. As usual, the men grouped themselves by tribes and busied themselves cooking their food. The tent of Sundiata stood in the middle of the camp surrounded by makeshift huts hastily built by the Mema horsemen. But all of a sudden the sound of warning horns was heard. The men hardly had time to snatch their weapons before the camp was surrounded by enemies looming out of the darkness. The men of Merna were used to these surprise attacks on their camp and therefore unsaddled their horses. As the camp did not con.stitute a single unit, each kin group had to defend itself individu.ally. Having escaped encirclement, Djata and the horsemen of Merna went to the help of Tabon Wana who seemed to be overwhelmed by numbers. In the pitch dark, no one knows how the men acquitted themselves. All that can be said is that the son of Sogolon broke -the vice that was squeezing the breath out of Tabon Wana. The archers of Wagadou had quickly pulled them. selves together and fired into the air torches and flaming arrows which fell among the enemy. Suddenly there was a panic. The burning brands crashed on to the bare Lacks of Soumaoro's sofas, cries of pain filled the sky and the Sossos began a headlong retreat while the cavalry cut them to pieces. The overwhelmed Sossos took to flight, again leaving many captives in the hands of Sundiata's men. Leaving to Tabon Wana the task of regrouping the men, Sundiata pursued the enemy with his cavalry to beyond the village of Kankigne. When he returned the struggle was over. The Sossos' night attack had caused more fright than real damage. On the ground near Tabon Wana's tent were found several"split .skulls. The king of Tabon never hit a man twice! The battle of Kankigne was not a great victory but it demoralized the Sossos. However, there had been great fear in Djata's ranks and that is why the griots sing: 'Kankigne Tahe hara djougonya. ' 59 The Names of the Heroes The surprise attack at Kankigne had turned out badly for Soumaoro and succeeded only in increasing the wrath of Sundiata, who decimated the whole of the Sosso rearguard. Soumaoro got back to Sosso to recover his strength while on all sides villages opened their gates to Sundiata. In all these villages Sundiata recruited soldiers. In the same way as light precedes the sun, so the glory of Sundiata, overleaping the mountains, shed itself on all the Niger plain. All the rebellious kings of the savanna country had gathered at Sibi under the command of Kamandjan, the very same child. hood friend of Sundiata and now himself the king of Sibi. Kamandjan and Tabon Wana were cousins, the former being the 54. king of the Dalikimbon group of Kamaras, the latter being king \ of the iron-working Kamaras who were called Sinikimbon. Thus the Niani trio were going to meet again. Fakoli, the nephew of Soumaoro, had gone right to the south to recruit troops. He was bent on having his revengeá on his uncle and recovering his wife, Keleya, she who was called 'the woman of the three hundred and thirty-three gourds of rice'. Sundiata had now entered the region of the plains, the land of the powerful Niger. The trees that he saw were those of Mali, everything indicated that old Mali was near. All the allies had arranged to meet up in the great plain of Sibi, and all the children of the savanna were there about their kings. There they were, the valorous sons of Mali, awaiting what destiny had promised them. Pennants¥¥ of all colours fluttered above the sofas divided up by tribes. l With whom should I begin; with whom end? _ I shall begin with Siara Kouman Konate. Siara Kouman Konatci, the cousin of Sundiata was there. He was the ancestor of those who live in the land of Toron. His spear-armed troops formed a thick hedge around him. I will also mention Faony Konde, Faony Diarra, the king of the land of Do whence came Sogolon. Thus the uncle had come to meet his nephew. Faony, king of Do and Kri, was surrounded by sofas armed with deadly arrows. They formed a solid wall around his standard. You also will I cite, Mansa Traore, king of the Traore trib_e; Mansa Traore, the double-sighted king, was at Sibi. Mansa Traore could see what was going on behind him just as other men can see in front of them. His sofas, formidable archers with quivers on their shoulders, thronged around him. As for you, Kamandjan, I cannot forget you among those whom I extol, for you are the father of the Dalikimbon Kamaras. The Kamaras, armed with long spears, raised their menacing pikes around Kamandjan. . In short, all the sons of Mali were there, all those who say 'N'Ko', 61 all who speak the clear language of Mali were repre.sented at Sibi. When the son of the buffalo woman and his army appeared, the trumpets, drums and tam-tams blended with the voices of the griots. The son of Sogolon was surrounded by his swift 55 horsemen and his horse pranced along. All eyes were fixed on the child of Mali, who shone with glory and splendour. When he was within call, Kamandjan made a gesture and the drums, tam. tams and voices fell silent. Leaving the ranks, the king of Sibi went towards Sundiata and cried, 'Maghan Sundiata, son of Sogolon, son of Nare Maghan, assembled Mali awaits you. Hail to you, I am Kamandjan, king of Sibi.' Raising his hand, Maghan Sundiata spoke thus: 'I salute you all, sons of Mali, and I salute you, Kamandjan. I have come back, and as long as I breathe Mali will never be in thrall-rather death than slavery. We will live free because our ancestors lived free. I am going to avenge the indignity that Mali has under. gone.' A shout of joy issuing from thousands of throats filled the whole heaven. The drums and tam-tams rumbled while the griots struck up Balla Fasseke's 'Hymn to the Bow'. It was thus that Sundiata met the sons of Mali gathered at Sibi. Nana Triban and Balla Fasseke r. ('',,, Sundiata and his mighty army stopped at Sibi for a few days. The road into Mali lay open, but Soumaoro was not yet vanquished. ¥áá, The king of Sosso had mustered a powerful army and his sofas ,á: were numbered by the thousand. He had raised contingents in }'.;; all the lands over which he held sway and got ready to pounce ',, á;á, again on Mali. ij With scrupulous care, Sundiata had made his preparations at ,¥ Sibi. Now he had sufficient sofas to meet Soumaoro in the open field, but it was not a question of having a lot of troops. In order to defeat Soumaoro it was necessary first of all to destroy his ! ' magical power. At Sibi, Sundiata decided to consult the sooth.s~y~r_s, of whom the most famous in Mali were there. __ , On their advice Djata had to sacrifice a hundred white bulls, a hundred white rams and a hundred white cocks. It was in the middle of this slaughter that it was announced to Sundiata that his sister Nana Triban and Balla Fasseke, having been able to escape from Sosso, had now arrived. Then Sundiata said to Tabon 56 Wana, 'If my sister and Balla have been able to escape from Sosso, Soumaoro has lost the battle.' Leaving the site of the sacrifices, Sundiata returned to Sibi and met his sister and his griot. 'Hail, my brother,' said Nana Triban. 'Greetings, sister.' 'Hail Sundiata,' said Balla Fasseke. 'Greetings, my ~riot.' After numerous salutations, Sundiata asked the fugitives to relate how they had been able to elude the vigilance of a king such as Soumaoro. But Triban was weeping for joy. Since the time of their childhood she had shown much sympathy towards the crippled child that Sundiata had been. Never had she shared the hate of her mother, Sassouma Berete. 'You know, Djata,' she said, weeping, 'for my part I did not want you to leave the country. It was my mother who did all that. Now Niani is destroyed, its inhabitants scattered, and there are many whom Soumaoro has carried off into captivity in Sosso.' She cried worse than ever. Djata was sympathetic to all this, but he was in a hurry to know something about Sosso. Balla Fasseke understood and said, 'Triban, wipe away your tears and tell your story, speak to your brother. You know that he has never thought ill of you, and besides, all that was in his destiny.' Nana Triban wiped her tears away and spoke. 'When you left Mali, my brother sent me by force to Sosso to be the wife of Soumaoro, whom he greatly feared. I wept a great deal at the beginning but when I saw that perhaps all was not lost I resigned myself for the time being. I was nice to Soumaoro and was the chosen one among his numerous wives. I had my chamber in the great tower where he himself lived. I knew how to flatter him and make him jealous. Soon I became his con-'1 fidante and I pretended to hate you, to share the hate which my I; ~other bore you. It was said that you would come back one day, : ,,,, but I swore to him that you would never have the presumption , r }". á to claim a kingdom you had never possessed, and that you had left never to see Mali again. However, I was in constant touch with Balla Fasseke, each of us wanting to pierce the mystery of" Soumaoro's magic power. One night I took the bull by the horns and .. said to Soumaoro: "T~ll me, oh you whom kings mention with trembling, tell me Soumaoro, are you a man like others or are you the same as the jinn who protects humans? No one can bear the glare of your eyes, your arm has the strength of ten arms. Tell me, king of kings, tell me what jinn protects you so that I can worship him also." These words filled him with pride ; and he himself boasted to me of the might of his Tana.¥¥ That very night he took me into his magic chamber and told me all. 'Then I redoubled my zeal to show myself faithful to his cause, I seemed more overwhelmed than him. It was even he who went to the extent of telling me to take courage, that nothing was yet lost. During all this time, in complicity with Balla Fasseke, I was preparing for the inevitable flight. Nobody watched over me any more in the royal enclosure, of which I kllew the smallest twists and turns.á And one night when Soumaoro was away, I left that fearsome tower. Balla Fasseke was waiting for me at the gate to which I had the key. It was thus, brother, that we left Sosso.' Balla Fasseke took up the story: 'We hastened to you. The news of the victory of Tabon made me realize that the lion had burst his chains. Oh son of Sogolon, ¥ I am the yvprd and ..you.are_th,Ldeed, nov,v;your destiny.begins.' á Sundiata was very happy to recover his sister and his griot. He now had the singer who would perpetuate his memory by his words,I_hfrn_yvou)d not be auy heroes if deeds were condemned.to ,. ITlllli_'ás for we ply our trade to excite the admiration of forg~tf1:1:lne_ss, áthe living, a.ri.d tO evoke the veneration of those who are to co~e. Djata was informed that Soumaoro was advancing along the river and was trying to block his route to Mali. The prepara.tions were complete, but before leaving Sibi, Sundiata arranged a great military review in the camp so that Balla Fasseke, by his words, should strengthen the hearts of his sofas. In the middle of a great circle formed by the sofas, Balla Fasseke extolled the heroes of Mali. To the king of Tabon he said: 'You whose iron arm can split ten skulls at a time, you, Tabon Wana, king of the Sinikimbon and the Djallonke, can you show me what you are capable of befor.ec.l'he great battle is joined?' Th;,.,g,:iE,t.Lford~ made Fran Kamara leap up. Sword in hand and mounted on his swift steed he came and stood before Sun. diata and said, 'Maghan Sundiata, I renew my oath to you in the sight of all the Mandingoes gathered together. I pledge myself to conquer or to die by your side. Mali will be free or the smiths of Tabon will be dead.' The tribes of Tabon shouted ,,.eir approval, brandishing their weapons, and Fran Kamara, stirred by the shouts of the sofas, spurred his charger and charged forward. The warriors opened their ranks and he bore down on a great mahogany tree. With one stroke of his sword he split the giant tree just as one splits a paw-paw. The flabbergasted army shouted, 'Wassa Wassa ... Aye .. _,,a Then, coming back to Sundiata, his sword held aloft, the king of Tabon said, 'Thus on the Niger plain will the smiths of Tabon cleave those of Sosso in twain.' And the hero came and fell in beside Sundiata. Turning towards Kamandjan, the king of Sibi and cousin of the king of Tabon, Balla Fasseke said, 'Where are you, Kamand.jan, where is Fama Djan? 64 Where is the king of the Dalikim.bon Kamaras. Kamandjan of Sibi, I salute you. But what will I áhave to relate of you to future generations?' Before Balla had finished speaking, the king of Sibi, shouting his war-cry, started his fiery charger off at full gallop. The sofas, stupefied, watched the extraordinary horseman head for the mountain that dominates Sibi .... Suddenly a tremendous din filled the sky, the earth trembled under the feet of the sofas and a ~loud of red dust covered the mountain. Was this the end of the world? ... But slowly the dust cleared and the sofas saw Kamand.jan coming back holding a fragment of a sword. The mountain of Sibi, pierced through and through, disclosed a wide tunnel! Admiration was at its highest pitch. The army stood speechless and the king of Sibi, without saying a word, came and fell in qeside Sundiata. á , \ Balla Fasseke 'mentioned all the chiefs by na_rge and they all ! I ¥ performed great feats; then .the army, confident in its leadership, ', left "Sibi. ) Krina Sundiata went and pitched camp at Dayala in the valley of the 7 Niger. Now it was he who was blocking Soumaoro's road to the south. Up till that time, Sundiata and Soumaoro had fought each other without a declaration of war. One does not wage war without saying why it is being waged. Those fighting should make a declaration of their grievances to begin with. Just as a sorcerer ought not to attack someone without taking him to task for some evil deed, so a king should not wage war without saying why he is taking up arms. --á..Boumaoro advanced as far as Krina, near the village of Dayala on the Niger and decided to assert his rights before joining battle. Sollmaoro knew that Sundiata also was a sorcerer, so, instead of á sending an embassy, he committed his words to one ,of his owls. The night bird came and perched on ~he roof of Djata's tent and spoke. The son of Sogolon in his turn sent his owl to Soumaoro. Here is the dialogue of the sorcerer kings: . á¥&amp;op, young man. Henceforth I am the king of Mali. If you want peace, return to where you came from,' said Soumaoro. 'I am coming back, Soumaoro, to recapture my kingdom. If you want peace you will make amends to my allies and return to r, Sosso where you are the king.' :; 'I am king of Mali by force of arms. My rights have been established by conquest.' 'Then I will take Mali from you by force of arms and chase you from my kingdom.' 'Know, then, that I am the wild yam of the rocks; nothing will make me leave Mali.' 'Know, also that I have in my camp seven master smiths who will shatter the rocks. Then, yam, I will eat you.' 'I am the poisonous mushroom that makes the fearless vomit., 'As for me, I am the ravenous cock, the poison does not matter to me.' 'Behave yourself, little boy, or you will burn your foot, for I am the red-hot cinder.' 'But me, I am the rain that extinguishes the cinder; I am the boisterous torrent that will carry you off.' 'I am the mighty silk-cotton tree that looks from on high on the tops of other trees.' 'And I, I am the strangling creeper that climbs to the top of the forest giant.' 'Enough of this argument. You shall not have Mali.' 'Know that there is not room for two kings on the same skin, Soumaoro; you will let me have your place.' 'Very well, since you want war I will wage war against you, f' ('i but I would have you know that I have killed nine kings whose heads adorn my room. What a pity, indeed, that your head should take its place beside those of your fellow madcaps.' 'Prepare yourself, Soumaoro, for it will be long before the calamity that is going to crash down upon you and yours comes to an end.' á Thus Sundiata and Soumaoro spoke together. After the war of, mouths, swords had to decide the issue. Sogolon's son was in his1 tent when someone came to announce to him the arrival of Fakoli, Soumaoro's insurgent nephew. All the men stood to arms and the war chiefs drew up their men. When everything was in order in the camp, Djata and the Mandingo leaders received Fakoli followed by his warriors. Fakoli halted before Sundiata and spoke thus: 'I salute you, Sundiata. I am Fakoli Koroma, king of the tribe of Koroma smiths. Soumaoro is the brother of my mother Kassia. I have taken up arms against my uncle because he has outraged me. Without fearing incest he has pushed his effrontery to the lengths of robbing me of my wife Keleya. As for you, you are coming to reconquer the kingdom of your fathers, you are fight.ing Soumaoro. We have the same goal and therefore I come to place myself under your orders. I bring you my strong-armed smiths, J;bring you sofas who do not know what fear is. Sundiata, I and my men are yours.' Balla, Sundiata's griot, said, 'Fakoli, come and sit among your brothers whom Soumaoro's injustice has smitten, the judge folds you to his bosom. You could not do better than entrust your cause to the son of Sogolon.' Sundiata made a sign indicating that the griot had spoken well, but he added, 'I defend the weak, I defend the innocent, Fakoli. You have suffered an injustice so I will render you jus.tice, but I have my lieutenants about me and I would like to know their opinions.' All the war chiefs agreed. Fakoli's cause became Sundiata's cause. Justice had to be granted to the man who came to implore justice. Thus Sundiata accepted Fakoli Da-Ba, Large-Mouthed Fakoli, among his war chiefs. Sundiata wanted to have done with Soumaoro before the rainy season, so he struck camp and marched on Krina where Soumaoro was encamped. The latter realized that the decisive battle had come. Sundiata deployed his men on the little hill that dominates the plain. The great battle was for the next day. In the evening, to raise the meri's spirits, Djata gave a great¥ feast, for he was anxious that his men should wake up happy in the morning. Several oxen were slaughtered and that evening ¥ Balla Fasseke, in front of the whole army, called to mind the history of old Mali. He praised Sundiata, seated amidst his lieutenants, in this manner: 'Now I address myself to you, Ma'ghan Sundiata, I speak to you ::1 :'!",I king of Mali, to whom dethroned monarchs flock. The time fore. '. ."i'~ i!' : :) :!:::!: told to you by the jinn is now coming. Sundiata, kingdoms and .) ',11Hfá empires are in the likeness of man; like him they are born, they: r;;:11: ,:,I I grow and disappear. Each sovereign embodies one moment of that 'Ii!(á:.:á: life. Formerly, the kings of Ghana extended their kingdom over ':t all the lands inhabited by the black man, but the circle has closed ;_':'tc,.¥_,_ ,, ' and the Cisses of Wagadou are nothing more than petty princes '' I¥:, in a desolate land. Today, another kingdom looms up, powerful,r,1' the kingdom of Sosso. Humbled kings have borne their tribute fit to Sosso, Soumaoro's arrogance knows no more bounds and his cruelty is equal to his ambition. But will Soumaoro dominate the world? Are we, the griots of Mali, condemned to pass on to future generations the humiliations which the king of -Sosso ,t , cares to inflict on our country? No, you may be glad, children of :t ' the "Bright Country", for the kingship of Sosso is but the growth I {' 11 of yesterday, whereas that-of Mali dates from the time of Bilali. ~ f;J,' ;(,-1'? itsshi)dhood, E}c:)i.-1i:fogciQm-ha¤ but Soumaoro wants to force the t,_:ffi,1 .,. vá pace, and so Sosso will collapse under him like a horse worn out [1 á1,1 , beneath its rider. 'You, Maghan, you are Mali. It has had a long and difficult ¥ childhood like you. Sixteen kings have preceded you on the throne of Niani, sixteen kings have reigned with varying fortunes, but from being village chiefs the Keitas have become tribal chiefs and then kings. Sixteen generations have consolidated their power. You are the outgrowth of Mali just as the silk-cotton tree is the growth of the earth, born of deep and mighty roots. To face the tempest the tree must have long roots and gnarled branches. Maghan Sundiata, has not the tree grown? 'I would have you know, son of Sogolon, that there is not room for two kings around the same calabash of rice. When a new cock comes to the poultry run the old cock picks a quarrel with 62 him and the docile hens wait to see if the new arrival asserts himself or yields. You have come to Mali. Very well, then, assert -yourself. Strength makes a law of its own self and power allows no division. 'But listen to what your ancestors did, so that you will know what you have to do. 'Bilali, the second of the name, conquered old Mali. Latal ¥ Kalabi conquered the country between the Niger and the San.karani. By going to Mecca, Lahibatoul Kalabi, of illustrious memory, brought divine blessing upon Mali. Mamadi Kani made warriors out of hunters and bestowed armed strength upon Mali. His son Bamari Tagnokelin, the vindictive king, terrorized Mali with.this army, but MaghanKon Fatta, also called Nani Maghan, to whom you owe your being, made peace prevail and happy mothers yielded Mali a populous youth. 'You are the son of Nare Maghan, but you are also the son of your mother Sogolon, the buffalo-woman, before whom power.less sorcerers shrank in fear. You have the strength and majesty of the lion, you have the might of the buffalo. 'I have told you what future generations will learn about your ancestors, but What will we be able to relate to our sons so that your memory will stay alive, what will we have to teach our sons about you? What unprecedented exploits, what unheard-of feats? By what distinguished actions will our sons be brought to regret not having lived in the time of Sundiata? 'G,:\91:s are men of the spoken word, and by the spoken word we give life to the gestures of kings. l;!.uLw.ords.,are,nothmg..!rn.t wcn;áds; power_ Hes in dee4.s... B_e a man of action; do not answer me a'uy more with your mouth, b{;.t.i0in0ff6W;á"OI-i"the plain of Krina, show me what you would have me recount to coming genera.tions. Tomorrow allow me to sing the "Song of the Vultures" over the bodies of the thousands of Sossos whom your sword will have laid low before evening.' It was on the eve of Krina. In this way Balla Fasseke reminded Sundiata of the history of Mali so that, in the morning, he would show himself worthy of his ancestors. At break of day, Fakoli came and woke up Sundiata to tell him that Soumaoro had begun to move his sofas out of Krina. The son of Sogolon appeared dressed like a hunter king. He wore tight.fitting, ochre-coloured trousers. He gave the order to draw up the sofas across the plain, and while his chiefs bustled about, Mantling Bory and Nana Triban came into Djata's tent. 'Brother,' said Mantling Bory, 'have you got the bow ready?' 1Yes,' replied Sundiata. 'Look.' He unhooked his bow from the wall, along with the deadly arrow. It was not an iron arrow at all, but Was made of wood and pointed with the spur of a white cock. The cock's spur was the Tana of Soumaoro, the secret which Nana Triban had managed to draw out of the kinfof Sosso. 'Brother,' said Nana Triban, 'Soumaoro now knows that I have fled from Sosso. Try to get near him for he will avoid you the whole battle long.' These words of Nana Triban left Djata worried, but Balla Fasseke, who had just come into the tent, said to Sundiata that the soothsayer had seen the end of Soumaoro in a dream. The sun had risen on the other side of the river and already lit the whole plain. Sundiata's troops deployed from the edge of the river across the plain, but Soumaoro's army was so big that other sofas remalning in Krina had ascended the ramparts to see the battle. Soumaoro was already distinguishable in the distance by his tall headdress, and the wings of his enormous army brushed the river on one side and the hills on the other. As at Negue. boria, Sundiata did not deploy all his forces. The bowmen of Wagadou and the Djallonkes stood at the rear ready to spill out on the left towards the hills as the battle spread. Fakoli Koroma and Kamandjan were in the front line with Sundiata and his cavalry. With his powerful voice Sundiata cried 'An gnewa.' 65 The order was repeated from tribe to tribe and the army started off. Soumaoro stood on the right with his cavalry. Djata and his cavalry charged with great dash but they were stopped by the horsemen of Diaghan and a struggle to the death began. Tabon Wana and the archers of Wagadou stretched out their lines towards the hills and the battle spread over the entire plain, while an unrelenting sun climbed in the sky. The horses of Merna were extremely agile, and they reared forward with their fore hooves raised and swooped down on the horsemen of Diaghan, who rolled on the ground trampled under the horses' hooves. Presently the men of Diaghan gave ground and fell back towards the rear. The enemy centre was broken. It was then that Mantling Bory galloped up to announce to Sundiata that Soumaoro, having thrown in all his reserve, had swept down on Fakoli and his smiths. Obviously Soumaoro was bent on punishing his nephew. Already overwhelmed by the numbers, Fakoli's men were beginning to give ground. The battle was not yet won. His eyes red with anger, Sundiata pulled his cavalry over to the left in the direction of the hills where Fakoli was valiantly en.during his uncle's blows. But wherever the son of the buffalo passed, death rejoiced. Sundiata's presence restored the balance momentarily, but Soumaoro's sofas were too numerous all the same. Sogolon's son looked for Soumaoro and caught sight of him in the middle of the fray. Sundiata struck out right and left and the Sossos scrambled out of his way. The king of Sosso, who did not want Sundiata to get near him, retreated far behind his men, but Sundiata followed him with his eyes. He stopped and bent his bow. The arrow flew and grazed Soumaoro on the shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
